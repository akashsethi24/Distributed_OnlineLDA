Abstract 
Lateral competition within a layer of neurons sharpens and localizes the 
response to an input stimulus. Here, we investigate a model for the ac- 
tivity dependent development of ocular dominance maps which allows 
to vary the degree of lateral competition. For weak competition, it re- 
sembles a correlation-based learning model and for strong competition, 
it becomes a self-organizing map. Thus, in the regime of weak compe- 
tition the receptive fields are shaped by the second order statistics of the 
input patterns, whereas in the regime of strong competition, the higher 
moments and features of the individual patterns become important. 
When correlated localized stimuli from two eyes drive the cortical de- 
velopment we find (i) that a topographic map and binocular, localized 
receptive fields emerge when the degree of competition exceeds a critical 
value and (ii) that receptive fields exhibit eye dominance beyond a sec- 
ond critical value. For anti-correlated activity between the eyes, the sec- 
ond order statistics drive the system to develop ocular dominance even 
for weak competition, but no topography emerges. Topography is estab- 
lished only beyond a critical degree of competition. 
1 Introduction 
Several models have been proposed in the past to explain the activity depending develop- 
ment of ocular dominance (OD) in the visual cortex. Some models make the ansatz of 
linear interactions between cortical model neurons [2, 7], other approaches assume com- 
petitive winner-take-all dynamics with intracortical interactions [3, 5]. The mechanisms 
that lead to ocular dominance critically depend on this choice. In linear activity models, 
second order correlations of the input patterns determine the receptive fields. Nonlinear 
competitive models like the self-organizing map, however, use higher order statistics of the 
input stimuli and map their features. In this contribution, we introduce a general nonlinear

us to systematically study the role of non-linearity in the lateral interactions on pattern for- 
mation and the transition between two classes of models. 
2 Ocular Dominance Map Development by Hebbian Learning 
Figure 1 shows our basic model framework for ocular dominance development. We con- 
sider two input layers in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). The input patterns p -- 
1,..., U on these layers originate from the two eyes and completely characterize the in- 
put statistics (the mean activity P is identical for all input neurons). The afferent synaptic 
connection strengths of cortical cells develop according to a generalized Hebbian learning 
rule with learning rate r/.

An analogous rule is used for the connections from the right eyes S:. We use v - 2 in the 
following and rescale the length of each neurons receptive field weight vector to a constant 
length after a learning step. The model includes effective cortical interactions I for the 
development of smooth cortical maps that spread the output activities O] in the neighbor- 
hood of neuron z (with a mean f = N Y' I:v for N output neurons). The cortical output 
signals are connectionist neurons with a nonlinear activation function g(.),

which models the effect of cortical response sharpening and competition for an input stim- 
ulus. The degree of competition is determined by the parameter/3. Such dynamics may re- 
sult as an effect of local excitation and long range inhibition within the cortical layer [6, 1 ], 
and in the limits of weak and strong competition, we recover two known types of develop- 
mental models--the correlation based learning model and the self-organizing map. 
2.1 From Linear Neurons to Winner-take-all Networks 
In the limit/ -+ 0 of weak cortical competition, the output O becomes a linear function 
of the input. A Taylor series expansion around 3: 0 yields a correlation-based-learning 
(CBL) rule in the average over all patterns

where C'fi/ - '7 ', is the correlation function of the input patterns. Ocular 
dominance development under this rule requires correlated activity between inputs from

show the activity rates y Iy O' for a network of cortical output neurons (the plots are 
scaled to have equal maxima). Each gridpoint represents the activity of one neuron on a 
16 x 16 grid. The interactions I are Gaussian (variance 2.25 grid points) and all neu- 
rons are stimulated with the same Gaussian stimulus (variance 2.25). The neurons have 
Gaussian receptive fields (variance 0.2 = 4.5) in a topographic map with additive noise 
(uniformly distributed with amplitude 10 times the maximum weight value). 
within one eye and anti-correlated activity (or uncorrelated activity with synaptic competi- 
tion) between the two eyes [2, 4]. It is important to note, however, that CBL models cannot 
explain the emergence of a topographic projection. The topography has to be hard-wired 
from the outset of the development process which is usually implemented by an arbor 
function that forces all non-topographic synaptic weights to zero. 
Strong competition with/3  oo, on the other hand, leads to a self-organizing map [3, 5], 
lSf = riI:q()Pi  with q(p)= argmax E(SjP  + S.P,') .

Models of this type use the higher order statistics of the input patterns and map the impor- 
tant features of the input. In the SOM limit, the output activity pattern is identical in shape 
for all input stimuli. The input influences only the location of the activity on the output 
layer but does not affect its shape. 
For intermediate values of/, the shape of the output activity patterns depends on the input. 
The activity of neurons with receptive fields that match the input stimulus better than oth- 
ers is amplified, whereas the activity of poorly responding neurons is further suppressed as 
shown in figure 2. On the one hand, the resulting output activity profiles for intermediate/3 
may be biologically more realistic than the winner-take-all limit case. On the other hand, 
the difference between the linear response case (low/) and the nonlinear competition (in- 
termediate/3) is important in the Hebbian development process--it yields qualitatively dif- 
ferent results as we show in the next section. 
2.2 Simulations of Ocular Dominance Development 
In the following, we study the transition from linear CBL models to winner-take-all SOM 
networks for intermediate values of/3. We consider input patterns that are localized and 
show ocular dominance

Each stimulus p is of Gaussian shape centered on a random position !oc(p) within the input 
layer and the neuron index i is interpreted as a two-dimensional location vector in the input 
layer. The parameter eye(p) sets the eye dominance for each stimulus. eye = 0 produces 
binocular stimuli and eye = +  results in uncorrelated left and right eye activities. 
We have simulated the development of receptive fields and cortical maps according to 
equations 1 and 2 (see figure 3) for square grids of model neurons with periodic bound- 
ary conditions, Gaussian cortical interactions, and OD stimuli (equation 3). The learning
