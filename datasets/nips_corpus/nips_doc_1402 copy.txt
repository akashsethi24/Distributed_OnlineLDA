Abstract 
We model the responses of cells in visual area V1 during natural 
vision. Our model consists of a classical energy mechanism whose 
output is divided by nonclassical gain control and texture contrast 
mechanisms. We apply this model to review movies, a stimulus 
sequence that replicates the stimulation a cell receives during free 
viewing of natural images. Data were collected from three cells 
using five different review movies, and the model was fit separately 
to the data from each movie. For the energy mechanism alone we 
find modest but significant correlations (rr -- 0.41, 0.43, 0.59, 
0.35) between model and data. These correlations are improved 
somewhat when we allow for suppressive surround effects (rr+G -- 
0.42, 0.56, 0.60, 0.37). In one case the inclusion of a delayed 
suppressive surround dramatically improves the fit to the data by 
modifying the time course of the model's response. 
I INTRODUCTION 
Complex cells in the primary visual cortex (area V1 in primates) are tuned to 
localized visual patterns of a given spatial frequency, orientation, color, and drift 
direction (De Valois &: De Valois, 1990). These cells have been modeled as linear 
spatio-temporal filters whose output is rectified by a static nonlinearity (Adelson 
&: Bergen, 1985); more recent models have also included a divisive contrast gain 
control mechanism (Heeger, 1992; Wilson &: Humanski, 1993; Geisler &: Albrecht, 
1997). We apply a modified form of these models to a stimulus that simulates 
natural vision. Our model uses relatively few parameters yet incorporates the cells' 
temporal response properties and suppressive influences from beyond the classical 
receptive field (CRF).

2 METHODS 
Data Collection: Data were collected from one awake behaving Macaque monkey, 
using single unit recording techniques described elsewhere (Connor et al., 1997). 1 
First, the cell's receptive field size and location were estimated manually, and tun- 
ing curves were objectively characterized using two-dimensional sinusoidal gratings. 
Next a static color image of a natural scene was presented to the animal and his 
eye position was recorded continuously as he freely scanned the image for 9 seconds 
(Gallant et al., 1998). 2 Image patches centered on the position of the cell's CRF 
(and 2-4 times the CRF diameter) were then extracted using an automated proce- 
dure. The sequence of image patches formed a continuous 9 second review movie 
that simulated all of the stimulation that had occurred in and around the CRF 
during free viewing. 3 Although the original image was static, the review movies 
contain the temporal dynamics of the saccadic eye movements made by the animal 
during free viewing. Finally, the review movies were played in and around the CRF 
while the animal performed a fixation task. 
During free viewing each eye position is unique, so each image patch is likely to 
enter the CRF only once. The review movies were therefore replayed several times 
and the cell's average response with respect to the movie timestream was computed 
from the peri-stimulus time histogram (PSTH). These review movies also form the 
model's stimulus input, while its output is relative spike probability versus time 
(the model cell's PSTH). 
Before applying the model each review movie was preprocessed by converting to 
gray scale (since the model does not consider color tuning), setting the average 
luminance level to zero (on a frame by frame basis) and prefiltering with the human 
contrast sensitivity function to more accurately reflect the information reaching cells 
in V1. 
Divisive Normalization Model: The model consists of a classical receptive field 
energy mechanism, EC/F, whose output is divided by two nonclassical suppressive 
mechanisms, a gain control field, G, and a texture contrast field, T.

We include a delay parameter for suppressive effects, consistent with the hypothesis 
that these effects may be mediated by local cortical interactions (Heeger, 1992; 
Wilson 8 Humanski, 1993). Any latency difference between the central energy 
mechanism and the suppressive surround will be reflected as a positive delay offset 
(d > 0 in Equation 1). 
Classical Receptive Field Energy Mechanism: The energy mechanism, ECRF, 
is composed of four phase-dependent subunits, U . Each subunit computes an inner 
product in space and a convolution in time between the model cell's space-time 
classical receptive field, CRF(x,y, -), and the image, I(x, y,t).

3Eye position data were collected at I KHz, whereas the monitor display rate was 72.5 
Hz (14 ms per frame). Therefore each review movie frame was composed of the average 
stimulation occmTing during the corresponding 13.8 ms of free viewing.

The model presented here incorporates the simplifying assumption of a space-time 
separable receptive field structure, CRF(x, y, r) = CRF(x, y) CRF(r). 
Time is discretized into frames and space is discretized into pixels that match the 
review movie input. CRF(x, y) is modeled as a sinusoidal grating that is spatially 
weighted by a Gaussian envelope (i.e. a Gabor function). In this paper CRF(r) 
is approximated as a delta function following a constant latency. This minimizes 
model parameters and highlights the model's responses to the stimulus present at 
each fixation. The latency, orientation and spatial frequency of the grating, and 
the size of the CRF envelope, are all determined empirically by maximizing the fit 
between model and data. 4 
A static non-linearity ensures that the model PSTH does not become negative. 
We have examined both half-wave rectification, �(t): max[U�(t), 0], and half- 
squaring, 04(t) - (max[U4(t),O])2; here we present the results from half-wave 
rectification. Half-squaring produces small changes in the model PSTH but does 
not improve the fit to the data. 
The energy mechanism is made phase invariant by averaging over the rectified phase- 
dependent subunits:

Gain Control Field: Cells in V1 incorporate a contrast gain control mechanism 
that compensates for changes in local luminance. The gain control field, G, models 
this effect as the total image power in a region encompassing the CRF and surround.

P(kz, ky, r) is the spatial Fourier power of lUG(x, y, r) and 'a is a two dimensional 
Gaussian weighting function whose width sets the size of the gain control field. 
Heeger's (1992) divisive gain control term sums over many discrete energy mecha- 
nisms that tile space in and around the area of the CRF. Equation 5 approximates 
Heeger's approach in the limiting case of dense tiling. 
Texture Contrast Field: Cells in area V1 can be affected by the image surround- 
ing the region of the CRF (Knierim & Van Essen, 1992). The responses of many 
V1 cells are highest when the optimal stimulus is presented alone within the CFIF, 
and lowest when that stimulus is surrounded with a texture of similar orientation 
and frequency. The texture contrast field, T, models this effect as the image power 
4As a fit statistic we use the hnear correlation coefficient (Pearson's r) between model 
and data. Fitting is done with a gradient ascent algorithm. Our choice of correlation as a 
statistic eliminates the need to explicitly consider model normalization as a variable, and is 
very sensitive to latency mismatches between model and data. However, linear correlation 
is more prone to noise contamination than is X 2.

ycnr is a two dimensional Gaussian weighting function whose width matches the 
CRF envelope, and which suppresses the image center. Thus the texture controt 
term picks up oriented power from an annular region of the image surrounding the 
CRF envelope. T is made phe invariant by averaging over phe. 
3 RESULTS 
Thus far our model hs been evaluated on a small data set collected as part of 
a different study (Gallant et al., 1998). Two cells, 87A and 98C, were examined 
with one review movie each, while cell 97A was examined with three review movies. 
Using this data set we compare the model's response in two interesting situations: 
cell 97A, which had high orientation-selectivity, versus cell 87A, which had poor 
orientation-selectivity; and cell 98C, which was directionally-selective, versus cell 
97A, which was not directionally-selective. 
CRF Energy Mechanism: We separately fit the energy mechanism parameters 
to each of the three different cells. For cell 97A the three review movies were fit 
independently to test for consistency of the best fit parameters. 
Table 1 shows the correlation between model and data using only the CRF energy 
mechanism (a -- fi - 0 in Equation 1). The significance of the correlations was 
assessed via a permutation test. The correlation values for cells 97A and 98C,
