Abstract 
High frequency foreign exchange data can be decomposed into three 
components: the inventory effect component, the surprise information 
(news) component and the regular information component. The presence 
of the inventory effect and news can make analysis of trends due to the 
diffusion of information (regular information component) difficult. 
We propose a neural-net-based, independent component analysis to sep- 
arate high frequency foreign exchange data into these three components. 
Our empirical results show that our proposed multi-effect decomposition 
can reveal the intrinsic price behavior. 
1 Introduction 
Tick-by-tick, high frequency foreign exchange rates are extremely noisy and volatile, but 
they are not simply pure random walks (Moody & Wu 1996). The price movements are 
characterized by a number of stylized facts , including the following two properties: 
(1) short term, weak oscillations on a time scale of several ticks and (2) erratic occurrence 
of turbulence lasting from minutes to tens of minutes. Property (1) is most likely caused 
by the market makers' inventory effect (O'Hara 1995), and property (2) is due to surprise 
information, such as news, rumors, or major economic announcements. The price changes 
due to property (1) are referred to as the inventory effect component, and the changes due 
to property (2) are referred to as the surprise information component. The price changes 
due to other information is referred to as the regular information component. 
This terminology is borrowed from the financial economics literature. For additional properties 
of high frequency foreign exchange price series, see (Guilaumet, Dacorogna, Dave, Muller, Olsen & 
Pictet 1994).

Due to the inventory effect, price changes show strong negative correlations on short time 
scales (Moody & Wu 1995). Because of the surprise information effect, distributions of 
price changes are non-normal (Mandelbmt 1963). Since both the inventory effect and 
the surprise information effect are short term and temporary, their corresponding price 
components are independent of the fundamental price changes. However, their existence 
will se.riously affect data analysis and modeling (Moody & Wu 1995). Furthermore, the 
most reliable component of price changes, for forecasting purposes, is the long term trend. 
The presence of high frequency oscillations and short periods of turbulence make it difficult 
to identify and predict the changes in such trends, if they occur. 
In this paper, we propose a novel approach with the following price model: 
q(t) = cipl(t) + c2p2(t) + c3p3(t) + e(t) . (1) 
In this model, q(t) is the observed price series and p(t), p2(t) and p3(t) correspond 
respectively to the regular information component, the surprise information component and 
the inventory effect component. p (t), p2(t) and p3(t) are mutually independent and may 
individually be either iid or correlated. e(t) is process noise, and c, c2 and c3 are scale 
constants. Our goal is to find p (t), P2 (t) and p3 (t) given q(t). 
The outline of the paper is as follows. We describe our approach for multi-effect decompo- 
sition in Section 2. In Section 3, we analyze the decomposed price components obtained 
for the high frequency foreign exchange rates and characterize their stochastic properties. 
We Conclude and discuss the potential applications of our multi-effect decomposition in 
Section 4. 
2 Multi-effect Decomposition 
2.1 IndependentSource Separation 
The task of decomposing the observed price quotes into a regular information component, 
a surprise information component and an inventory effect component can be exactly fitted 
into the framework of independent source separation. Independent source separation can 
be described as follows: 
Assume that X = {xi, i = 1,2,... ,n) are the sensor outputs which 
are some superposition of unknown independent sources S = {si, i = 
1,2,..., m). The task of independent source separation is to find a 
mapping Y = f(X), so that Y  AS, where A is an m x m matrix in 
which each row and column contains only one non-zero element. 
Approaches to separate statistically-independent components in the inputs include 
Blind source separation (Jutten & Herault 1991), 
Information maximization CLinsker 1989), (Bell & Sejnowski 1995), 
Independent component analysis, (Comon 1994), (Amari, Cichocki & Yang 1996), 
Factorial coding (Barlow 1961). 
All of these approaches can be implemented by artificial neural networks. The network 
architectures can be linear or nonlinear, multi-layer perceptrons, recurrent networks or other 
context sensitive networks (Pearlmutter & Parra 1997). We can choose a training criterion 
to minimize the energy in the output units, to maximize the information transferred in 
the network, to reduce the redundancies between the outputs, or to use the Edgeworth 
expansion or Gram-Charlier expansion of a probability distribution, which leads to an 
analytic expression of the entropy in terms of measurable higher order cumulants.

decomposed components. 
For our price decomposition problem, the non-Gaussian nature of price series requires that 
the transfer.function of the decomposition system be nonlinear. In general, the nonlinearifies 
in the transfer function are able to pick up higher order moments of the input distributions 
and perform higher order statistical redundancy reduction between outputs. 
2.2 Reference input selection 
In traditional approaches to blind source separation, nothing is assumed to be known about 
the inputs, and the systems adapt on-line and without a supervisor. This works only if the 
number of sensors is not less than the number of independent sources. If the number of 
sensors is less than that of sources, the sources can, in theory, be separated into disjoint 
groups (Cao & Liu 1996). However, the problem is ill-conditioned for most of the above 
practical approaches which only consider the case where the number of sensors is equal to 
the number of sources. 
In our task to decompose the multiple components of price quotes, the problem can be 
divided into two cases. If the prices are sampled at regular intervals, we can use price 
quotes observed in different markets, and have the number of sensors be equal to the 
number of price components. However, in the high frequency markets, the price quotes 
are not regularly spaced in time. Price quotes from different markets will not appear at the 
same time, so we cannot apply the price quotes from different markets to the system. In 
this case, other reference inputs are needed. 
Motivated by the use of reference inputs for noise canceling (Widrow, Glover, McCool, 
Kaunitz, Williams, Hearn, Zeidler, Dong & Goodlin 1975), we generate three reference 
inputs from original price quotes. They are the estimates of the three desired components. 
In the following, we briefly describe our procedure for generating the reference inputs. 
By modeling the price quotes using a True Price state space model (Moody & Wu 1996) 
q(t) = r,(t) + 
(2) 
where rl (t) is an estimate of the information component (True Price) and r3(t) is an estimate 
of the inventory effect component (additive noise), and by assuming that the True Price 
ri(t) is a fractional Brownian motion (Mandelbrot & Van Ness 1968), we can estimate 
ri (t) and r3(t) with given q(t), (Moody & Wu 1996), as

extracted from September 1995. The three panels in each segment display the observed 
prices (.the dotted curve in upper panel), the regular information component (solid curve

where p,(t) is an orthogonal wavelet function, Q, is the coefficient of the wavelet 
transform of q(t), m is the index of the scales and n is the time index of the components in 
the wavelet transfer, S(m, 0) is a smoothing function, and its parameters can be estimated 
using the EM algorithm (Wornell & Oppenheim 1992). 
We then estimate the surprise information component as the residual between the informa- 
tion component and its moving average: 
r:(t) = r,(,)- 40 ï¿½ (5) 
s(t) is an exponential moving average of r (t) and 
40 = (1 1) 
(6) 
where c is a factor. Although it can be optimized based on the training data, we set 
c = -0.9 in our current work. 
Our system diagram for multi-effect decomposition is shown in Figure 1. Using multi- 
scale decomposition Eqn(3) and smoothing techniques Eqn(6), we obtain three reference 
inputs. We can then separate the reference inputs into three independent components via 
independent component analysis using an artificial neural network. Figure 2 presents multi- 
effect decompositions for two segments of the DEM/USD rates. The first segment contains 
some impulses, and the corresponding surprise information component is able to catch 
such volatile movements. The second segment is basically down trending, so its surprise 
information component is comparatively flat.
