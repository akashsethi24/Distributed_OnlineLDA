Abstract 
A general feature of the cerebral cortex is its massive intercon- 
nectivity - it has been estimated anatomically [19] that cortical 
neurons receive upwards of 5,000 synapses, the majority of which 
originate from other nearby cortical neurons. Numerous experi- 
ments in primary visual cortex (V1) have revealed strongly nonlin- 
ear interactions between stimulus elements which activate classical 
and non-classical receptive field regions. Recurrent cortical con- 
nections likely contribute substantially to these effects. However, 
most theories of visual processing have either assumed a feedfor- 
ward processing scheme [7], or have used recurrent interactions to 
account for isolated effects only [1, 16, 18]. Since nonlinear sys- 
tems cannot in general be taken apart and analyzed in pieces, it 
is not clear what one learns by building a recurrent model that 
only accounts for one, or very few phenomena. Here we develop 
a relatively simple model of recurrent interactions in V1, that re- 
flects major anatomical and physiological features of intracortical 
connectivity, and simultaneously accounts for a wide range of phe- 
nomena observed physiologically. All phenomena we address are 
strongly nonlinear, and cannot be explained by linear feedforward 
models. 
1 The Model 
We analyze the mean firing rates observed in oriented V1 cells in response to stimuli 
consisting of an inner circular grating and air outer annular grating. Mean responses 
of individual cells are modeled by single-valued cellular response functions, whose 
arguments are the mean firing rates of the cell's inputs and their maximal synaptic 
conductances.

1.1 Neuronal model 
Each neuron is modeled as a single voltage compartment in which the membrane 
potential V is given by: 
C, dt 
gex(t)(Eex - V(t)) + ginh(t)(Einh -- V()) + 
gleak(Eleak -- V(t)) + gahf(t)(Eahp -- V(t)) 
where Cm is the membrane capacitance, E is the reversal potential for current x, 
and g is the conductance for that current. If the voltage exceeds a threshold Vs, 
a spike is generated, and afterhyperpolarizing currents are activated. The conduc- 
tances for excitatory and inhibitory currents are modeled as sums of a-functions, 
and the ahp conductance is modeled as a decaying exponential. The model consists 
of two distinct cell types, excitatory and inhibitory, with realistic cellular param- 
eters [13], similar to the ones used in [17]. To compute the response functions for 
the two cell types, we simulated one cell of each type, receiving excitatory and in- 
hibitory Poisson inputs. The synaptic strengths were held constant, while the rates 
of the excitatory and inhibitory inputs were varied independently. 
Although the driving forces for excitation and inhibition vary, we found that single 
cell responses can be accurately modeled if incoming excitation and inhibition are 
combined linearly, and the net input is passed through a response function that 
is approximately threshold-linear, with some smoothing around threshold. This is 
consistent with the results of intracellular experiments that show linear synaptic 
interactions in visual cortex[5]. Note that the cellular functions are not sigmoids, 
and thus saturating responses could be achieved only through network interactions. 
1.2 Cortical connectivity 
The visual cortex shares with many other cortical areas a similar pattern of intra- 
areal connections [12]. Excitatory cells make dense local projections, as well as 
long-range horizontal projections that usually contact cells with similar response 
properties. Inhibitory cells make only local projections, which are spread further in 
space than the local excitatory connections [10]. We assume that cells with similar 
response properties have a higher probability of connection, and that probability 
falls down with distance in feature space. For simplicity, we consider only two 
feature dimensions: orientation and RF center in visual space. Since we are dealing 
with stimuli with radial symmetry, one spatial dimension is sufficient. The extension 
to more dimensions, i.e. another spatial dimension, direction selectivity, ocularity, 
etc., is straightforward. 
We assume that the feature space is filled uniformly with excitatory and inhibitory 
cells. Rather than modeling individual cells, we model a grid of locations, and 
for each location we compute the mean firing rate of cells present there. The 
connectivity is defined by two projection kernels Kex, Kin (one for each presynaptic 
cell type) and weights Wee, Wei, Wie, Wii, corresponding to the number and strength 
of synapses made onto excitatory/inhibitory cells. The excitatory projection has 
sharper tuning in orientation space, and bigger spread in visual space (Figure 1). 
1.3 Visual stimuli and thalamocortical input 
The visual stimulus is defined by five parameters: diameter d of the inner grating 
(the outer is assumed infinite), log contrast cx,c2, and orientation 0x, 02 of each 
grating. The two gratings are always centered in the spatial center of the model.

Each cortical cell receives LGN input which is the product of log contrast, orien- 
tation tuning, and convolution of the stinulus with a spatial receptive field. The 
LGN input computed in this way is multiplied by LCNe, LCNi, and sent to the 
cortical cells. Figure 2 shows an example of what the LGN input looks like. 
2 Results 
For given input LGN input, we computed the steady-state activity in cortex itera- 
tively (about 30 iteration were required). Since we studied the model for gradually 
changing stimulus parameters, it was possible to use the solution for one set of 
parameters as an initial guess for the next solution, which resulted in significant 
speedup. The results presented here are for the excitatory population, since i) it 
provides the output of the cortex; it) contains four times more cells than the in- 
hibitory population, and therefore is more likely to be recorded from. All results 
were obtained for the same set of parameters. 
2.1 Classical RF effects 
First we simulate responses to a central grating (ldeg diameter) for increasing log- 
contrast levels. It has been repeatedly observed that although LGN firing increases 
linearly with stimulus log-contrast, the contrast response functions observed in V1 
saturate, and may even supersaturate or (lec]ine[11, 2]. The most complete and re- 
cent model of that phenomena [6, 3] assumes shunting inhibition, which contradicts 
recent intracellular observations [4, 5]. Furthermore, that model cannot explain su- 
persaturation. Our model achieves saturatiolt (Figure 3A) for high contrast levels,

and can easily achieve supersaturation for different parameter setting. Instead of 
using shunting (divisive) inhibition, we suggest that inhibitory neurons have higher 
contrast thresholds than excitatory neurons, i.e. the direct LGN input to inhibitory 
cells is weaker. Note that we only need a subpopulation of inhibitory neurons with 
that property; the rest can have the same response threshold as the excitatory 
population. 
Another well-known property of V1 neurons is that their orientation tuning is 
roughly contrast-invariant[14]. The LGN input tuning is invariant, therefore this 
property is easily obtained in models where V1 responses are almost linear, rather 
than saturating [1, 16]. Achieving both contrast-invariant tuning and contrast sat- 
uration for the entire population (while singe cell feedforward response functions 
are non-saturating) is non-trivial. The problem is that invariant tuning requires the 
responses at all orientations saturate simultaneously. This is the case in our model 
(Figure 3B) - we found that the tuning (half width at half amplitude) varied within 
a 5deg range as contrast increased. 
2.2 Extraclassical RF effects 
Next we consider stimuli which include both a center and a surround grating. In the 
first set of simulations we held the diameter constant (at ldeg) and varied stimulus 
contrast and orientation. It has been observed [9, 15] that a high contrast iso- 
orientation surround stimulus facilitates responses to a low contrast, but suppresses 
responses to a high contrast center stimulus. T.his behavior is captured very well 
by our model (Figure 4A). The strong response to the surround stimulus alone is 
partially due to direct thalamic input (i.e. the thalamocortical projective field is 
larger than the classical receptive field of a V! cell). The response to an orthogonal 
surround is between the center and iso-orientation surround responses, as observed 
in [9]. 
Many neurons in V1 respond optimally to a center grating with a certain diameter, 
but their response decreases as the diameter increases (end-stopping). End-stopping 
in the model is shown in Figure 4B - responses to increasing grating diameter 
reach a peak and then decrease. In experiments it has been observed that the
