ABSTRACT 
In modeling studies of memory based on neural networks, both the selective 
enhancement and depression of synaptic strengths are required for efficient storage 
of information (Sejnowski, 1977a, b; Kohonen, 1984; Bienenstock et al, 1982; 
Sejnowski and Tesauro, 1989). We have tested this assumption in the hippocampus, 
a cortical structure of the brain that is involved in long-term memory. A brief, 
high-frequency activation of excitatory synapses in the hippocampus produces an 
increase in synaptic strength known as long-term potentiation, or LTP (Bliss and 
Lomo, 1973), that can last for many days. LTP is known to be Hebbian since it 
requires the simultaneous release of neurotransmitter from presynaptic terminals 
coupled with postsynaptic alepolarization (Kelso et al, 1986; Mannow and Miller, 
1986; Gustaffson et al, 1987). However, a mechanism for the persistent reduction of 
synaptic strength that could balance LTP has not yet been demonstrated. We stu- 
died the associative interactions between separate inputs onto the same dendritic 
trees of hippocampal pyramidal cells of field CA1, and found that a low-frequency 
input which, by itself, does not persistently change synaptic strength, can either 
increase (associative LTP) or decrease in strength (associative long.term depression 
or LTD) depending upon whether it is positively or negatively correlated in Ome 
with a second, high-frequency bursting input. LTP of synaptic strength is Hebbian, 
and LTD is anti.Hebbian since it is elicited by pairing presynaptic firing with post- 
synaptic hyperpolarization sufficient to block postsynaptic activity. Thus, associa- 
tive LTP and associative LTD are capable of storing information contained in the 
covariance between separate, converging hippocampal inputs.

Storing Covariance by Synaptic Strengths in the Hippocampus 395 
INTRODUCTION 
Associative LTP can be produced in some hippocampal neurons when low- 
frequency, (Weak) and high-frequency (Strong) inputs to the same cells are simultane- 
ously activated (Levy and Steward, 1979; Levy and Steward, 1983; Barrionuevo and 
Brown, 1983). When stimulated alone, a weak input does not have a long-lasting effect 
on synaptic strength; however, when paired with stimulation of a separate strong input 
sufficient to produce homosynaptic LTP of that pathway, the weak pathway is associa- 
tively potentiated. Neural network modeling studies have predicted that, in addition to 
this Hebbian form of plasticity, synaptic strength should be weakened when weak and 
strong inputs are anti-correlated (Sejnowski, 1977a,b; Kohonen, 1984; Bienenstock et al, 
1982; Sejnowski and Tesauro, 1989). Evidence for heterosynaptic depression in the hip- 
pocampus has been found for inputs that are inactive (Levy and Steward, 1979; Lynch et 
al, 1977) or weakly active (Levy and Steward, 1983) during the stimulation of a strong 
input, but this depression did not depend on any pattern of weak input activity and was 
not typically as long-lasting as LTP. 
Therefore, we searched for conditions under which stimulation of a hippocampal 
pathway, rather than its inactivity, could produce either long-term depression or potentia- 
tion of synaptic strengths, depending on the pattern of stimulation. The stimulus para- 
digm that we used, illustrated in Fig. 1, is based on the finding that bursts of stimuli at 5 
Hz are optimal in eliciting LTP in the hippocampus (Larson and Lynch, 1986). A high- 
frequency burst (STRONG) stimulus was applied to Schaffer collateral axons and a low- 
frequency (WEAK) stimulus given to a separate subicular input coming from the oppo- 
site side of the recording site, but terminating on dendrites of the same population of CA1 
pyramidal neurons. Due to the rhythmic nature of the strong input bursts, each weak 
input shock could be either superimposed on the middle of each burst of the strong input 
(IN PHASE), or placed symmetrically between bursts (OUT OF PHASE). 
RESULTS 
Extracellular evoked field potentials were recorded from the apical dendritic and 
somatic layers of CA1 pyramidal cells. The weak stimulus train was first applied alone 
and did not itself induce long-lasting changes. The strong site was then stimulated alone, 
which elicited homosynaptic LTP of the strong pathway but did not significantly alter 
amplitude of responses to the weak input. When weak and strong inputs were activated 
IN PHASE, there was an associative LTP of the weak input synapses, as shown in Fig. 
2a. Both the synaptic excitatory post-synaptic potential (e.p.s.p.) (Ae.p.s.p. = 4-49.8 :k 
7.8%, n=20) and population action potential (Aspike = +65.4 :k 16.0%, n=14) were 
significantly enhanced for at least 60 rain up to 180 min following stimulation. 
In contrast, when weak and strong inputs were applied OUT OF PHASE, they eli- 
cited an associative long-term depression (LTD) of the weak input synapses, as shown in 
Fig. 2b. There was a marked reduction in the population spike (46.5 :k 11.4%, n=10) 
with smaller decreases in the e.p.s.p. (-13.8 :k 3.5%, n=13). Note that the stimulus pat- 
terns applied to each input were identical in these two experiments, and only the relofive 
396 Stanton and Sejnowski 
phase of the weak and strong stimuli was altered. With these stimulus patterns, synaptic 
strength could be repeatedly enhanced and depressed in a single slice, as illustrated in Fig 
2c. As a control experiment to determine whether information concerning covariance 
between the inputs was actually a determinant of plasticity, we combined the in phase 
and out of phase conditions, giving both the weak input shocks superimposed on the 
bursts plus those between the bursts, for a net frequency of 10 Hz. This pattern, which 
resulted in zero covariance between weak and strong inputs, produced no net change in 
weak input synaptic strength measured by extracellular evoked potentials. Thus, the asso-

resistance, 2M NaCI filled) and intracellular (70-120 M, 2M K-acetate filled) record- 
ing electrodes, and bipolar glass-insulated platinum wire stimulating electrodes (50 l.m

digms used. Strong input stimuli (STRONG INPUT) were four trains of 100 Hz bursts. 
Each burst had 5 stimuli and the interburst interval was 200 msec. Each train lasted 2 
seconds for a total of 50 stimuli. Weak input stimuli (WEAK INPUT) wre four trains of 
shocks at 5 Hz frequency, each train lasting for 2 seconds. When these inputs were IN 
PHASE, the weak single shocks were superimposed on the middle of each burst of the 
strong input. When the weak input was OUT OF PHASE, the single shocks were placed 
symmetrically between the bursts.

The simultaneous depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane and activation of 
glutamate receptors of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype appears to be neces-

interval as in Fig. 1) elicited synapse-specific LTP independent of other input activity. 
Test responses from the weak input (W, filled circles) show that stimulation of the weak 
pathway out of phase with the strong one produced associative LTD (Assoc LTD) of this 
input. Associative LTP (Assoc LTP) of the same pathway was then elicited following in 
phase stimulation. Amplitude and duration of associative LTD or LTP could be increased 
by stimulating input pathways with more trains of shocks.
