Abstract 
Neuromodulation can change not only the mean firing rate of a 
neuron, but also its pattern of firing. Therefore, a reliable neu- 
ral coding scheme, whether a rate coding or a spike time based 
coding, must be robust in a dynamic neuromodulatory environ- 
ment. The common observation that cholinergic modulation leads 
to a reduction in spike frequency adaptation implies a modifica- 
tion of spike timing, which would make a neural code based on 
precise spike timing difficult to maintain. In this paper, the effects 
of cholinergic modulation were studied to test the hypothesis that 
precise spike timing can serve as a reliable neural code. Using the 
whole cell patch-clamp technique in rat neocortical slice prepara- 
tion and compartmental modeling techniques, we show that cholin- 
ergic modulation, surprisingly, preserved spike timing in response 
to a fluctuating inputs that resembles in vivo conditions. This re- 
sult suggests that in vivo spike timing may be much more resistant 
to changes in neuromodulator concentrations than previous physi- 
ological studies have implied.

1 Introduction 
Recently, there has been a vigorous debate concerning the nature of neural coding 
(Rieke et al. 1996; Stevens and Zador 1995; Shadlen and Newsome 1994). The pre- 
vailing view has been that the mean firing rate conveys all information about the 
sensory stimulus in a spike train and the precise timing of the individual spikes is 
noise. This belief is, in part, based on a lack of correlation between the precise tim- 
ing of the spikes and the sensory qualities of the stimulus under study, particularly, 
on a lack of spike timing repeatability when identical stimulation is delivered. This 
view has been challenged by a number of recent studies, in which highly repeatable 
temporal patterns of spikes can be observed both in vivo (Bair and Koch 1996; 
Abeles et al. 1993) and in vitro (Mainen and Sejnowski 1994). Furthermore, appli- 
cation of information theory to the coding problem in the frog and house fly (Bialek 
et al. 1991; Bialek and Rieke 1992) suggested that additional information could be 
extracted from spike timing. In the absence of direct evidence for a timing code in 
the cerebral cortex, the role of spike timing in neural coding remains controversial. 
1.1 A necessary condition for a spike timing code 
If spike timing is important in defining a stimulus, precisely timed spikes must 
be maintained under a range of physiological conditions. One important aspect 
of a neuron's environment is the presence of various neuromodulators. Due to 
their widespread projections in the nervous system, major neuromodulators, such 
as acetylcholine (ACh) and norepinephrine (NA), can have a profound influence on 
the firing properties of most neurons. If a change in concentration of a neuromodu- 
lator completely alters the temporal structure of the spike train, it would be unlikely 
that spike timing could serve as a reliable neural code. A major effect of cholin- 
ergic modulation on cortical neurons is a reduction in spike frequency adaptation, 
which is characterized by a shortening of inter-spike-intervals and an increase in 
neuronal excitability (McCormick 1993; Nicoll 1988). One obvious consequence of 
this cholinergic effect is a modification of spike timing (Fig. 1A). This modification 
of spike timing due to a change in neuromodulator concentration would seem to 
preclude the possibility of a neural code based on precise spike timing. 
1.2 Re-examination of the cholinergic modulation of spike timing 
Despite its popularity, the square pulse stimulus used in most eletrophysiological 
studies is rarely encountered by a cortical neuron under physiological conditions. 
The corresponding behavior of the neuron at the input/output level may have lim- 
ited relevance to the behavior of the neuron under its natural condition, which is 
characterized in vivo by highly fluctuating synaptic inputs. In this paper, we re- 
examine the effect of cholinergic modulation on spike timing under two contrasting 
stimulus conditions: the physiologically unrealistic square pulse input versus the 
more plausible fluctuating input. We report that under physiologically more realis- 
tic fluctuating inputs, effects of cholinergic modulation preserved the timing of each 
individual spike (Fig. lB). This result is consistent with the hypothesis that spike 
timing may be relevant to information encoding.

2.1 Experimental 
Using the whole cell patch-clamp technique, we made somatic recordings from layer 
2/3 neocortical neurons in the rat visual cortex. Coronal slices of 400 um were 
prepared from 14 to 18 days old Long Evans rats (for details see (Mainen and Se- 
jnowski 1994). Spike trains elicited by current injection of 900 ms were recorded for 
the square pulse inputs and fluctuating inputs with equal mean synaptic inputs, in 
the absence and presence of a cholinergic agonist carbachol. The fluctuating inputs 
were constructed from Gaussian noise and convolved with an alpha function with a 
time constant of 3 ms, reflecting the time course of the synaptic events. The ampli- 
tude of fluctuation was such that the subthreshold membrane potential fluctuation 
observed in our experiments were comparable to that in whole-cell patch clamp 
study in vivo (Ferster and Jagadeesh 1992). The cholinergic agonist carbachol at 
concentrations of 5, 7.5, 15, 30 uM was delivered through bath perfusion (perfusion 
time: between I and 6 min). For each cell, three sets of blocks were recorded before, 
during and after carbachol perfusion at a given concentration. Each block contained 
20 trials of stimulation under identical experimental conditions. 
2.2 Simulation 
We used a compartmental model of a neocortical neuron to explore the contribution 
of three potassium conductances affected by cholinergic modulation (Madison et al. 
1987). Simulations were performed in a reduced 9 compartment model, based on 
a layer 2 pyramidal cell reconstruction using the NEURON program. The model 
had five conductances: gNa, gr, gear, gca, gr(ca). Membrane resistivity was 
40KQcra ', capacitance was lieFlibra ', and axial resistance was 200Qcra. Intrinsic 
noise was simulated by injecting a randomly fluctuating current to fit the spike jitter 
observed experimentally. Different potassium conductances were manipulated as 
independent variables and the spike timing displacement was measured for multiple 
levels of conductance change corresponding to multiple concentrations of carbachol. 
2.3 Data analysis 
For both experimental and simulation data, first derivatives were used to detect 
spikes and to determine the timing for spike initiation. Raster plots of the spike 
trains were derived from the series of membrane potentials for each trial, and a 
smoothed histogram was then constructed to reflect the instantaneous firing rate 
for each block of trials under identical stimulation and pharmacological conditions. 
An event was then defined as a period of increase in instantaneous firing rate that 
is greater than a threshold level (set at 3 times of the mean firing rate within the 
block of trials) (Mainen and Sejnowski 1994). 
The effect of carbachol on spike timing under fluctuating inputs was quantified by 
defining the displacement in spike timing for each event, di, as the time difference 
between the nearest peaks of the events under carbachol and control condition. The 
weight for each event, wi, is determined by the peak of the event. The higher the 
peak, the less the spike jitter. The mean displacement is

3 Results 
3.1 Experimental 
The effects of carbachol on spike timing under the square pulse and fluctuating 
inputs are shown in Fig. 1A and B respectively. In the absence of carbachol, a 
square pulse input produced a spike train with clear spike frequency adaptation 
(Fig. 1A1). Similar to previous reports from the literature, addition of carbachol 
to the perfusion medium reduced spike frequency adaptation (Fig. 1A2). This 
reduction in spike frequency adaptation is reflected in the shortening of inter-spike- 
intervals and an increase in the firing frequency. Most importantly, spike timing 
was altered by carbachol perfusion. When a fluctuating current was injected, the 
strong spike frequency adaptation observed under a square pulse input was no longer 
apparent (Fig. lB1). Unlike the results under the square pulse condition, addition 
of carbachol to the bath medium preserved the timing of the spikes (Fig. lB2). An 
increased excitability was achieved with the insertion of additional spikes between 
the existing spikes.
