Abstract 
It is known that humans can make finer discriminations between 
familiar sounds (e.g. syllables) than between unfamiliar ones (e.g. 
different noise segments). Here we show that a corresponding en- 
hancement is present in early auditory processing stages. Based on 
previous work which demonstrated that natural sounds had robust 
statistical properties that could be quantified, we hypothesize that 
the auditory system exploits those properties to construct efficient 
neural codes. To test this hypothesis, we measure the informa- 
tion rate carried by auditory spike trains on narrow-band stimuli 
whose amplitude modulation has naturalistic characteristics, and 
compare it to the information rate on stimuli with non-naturalistic 
modulation. We find that naturalistic inputs significantly enhance 
the rate of transmitted information, indicating that auditiory neu- 
ral responses are matched to characteristics of natural auditory 
scenes. 
I Natural Scene Statistics and the Neural Code 
A primary goal of hearing research is to understand how complex sounds that occur 
in natural scenes are processed by the auditory system. However, natural sounds 
are difficult to describe quantitatively and the complexity of auditory responses 
they evoke makes it hard to gain insight into their processing. Hence, most studies 
of auditory physiology are restricted to pure tones and noise stimuli, resulting in 
a limited understanding of auditory encoding. In this paper we pursue a novel 
approach to the study of natural sound encoding in auditory spike trains. Our

method consists of measuring statistical characteristics of natural auditory scenes, 
and incorporating them into simple stimuli in a systematic manner, thus creating 
'naturalistic' stimuli which enable us to study the encoding of natural sounds in a 
controlled fashion. The first stage of this program has been described in (Attias 
and Schreiner 1997); the second is reported below. 
Fig. I shows two segments of long stimuli and the corresponding spike trains of 
the same neuron, elicited by pure tones that were amplitude-modulated by these 
stimuli. While both stimuli appear to be random and to have the same mean and 
both spike trains have the same firing rate, one may observe that high and low 
amplitudes are more likely to occur in the stimulus on the left; indeed, these stimuli 
are drawn from two stimulus sets with different statistical properties. Our present 
study of auditory coding focuses on assessing the efficiency of this neural code: 
for a given stimulus set, how well can the animal reconstruct the input sound and 
discriminate between similar sound segments, based on the evoked spike train, and 
how those abilities are affected by changing the stimulus statistics. We quantify 
the discrimination capability of auditory neurons in the inferior colliculus of the cat 
using concepts from information theory (Bialek et al. 1991; Rieke et al. 1997). 
This leads to the issue of optimal coding (Atick 1992). Theoretically, given an 
auditory scene with particular statistical properties, it is possible to design an en- 
coding scheme that would exploit those properties, resulting in a neural code that 
is optimal for that scene but is consequently less efficient for other scenes. Here we 
investigate the hypothesis that the auditory system uses a code that is adapted to 
natural auditory scenes. This question is addressed by comparing the discrimination 
capability of auditory neurons between sound segments drawn from a naturalistic 
stimulus set, to the one for a non-naturalistic set. 
2 Statistics of Natural Sounds 
As a first step in investigating the relation between neural responses and auditory 
inputs, we studied and quantified temporal statistics of natural auditory scenes (At- 
tias and Schreiner 1997). It is well-known that different locations on the basal mem- 
brane respond selectively to different frequency components of the incoming sound 
x(t) (e.g., Pickles 1988), hence the frequency y corresponds to a spatial coordinate, 
in analogy with retinal location in vision. We therefore analyzed a large database 
of sounds, including speech, music, animal vocalizations, and background sounds, 
using various filter banks comprising 0- 10kHz. In each frequency band y, the am- 
plitude a(t) > 0 and phase b(t) of the band-limited signal x(t) = a(t) cos(t + b(t)) 
were extracted, and the amplitude probability distribution p(a) and auto-correlation

frequency dqb(t) /dt. 
Those statistics were found to be nearly identical in all bands and across all ex- 
amined sounds. In particular, the distribution of the log-amplitude  - log a, 
normalized to have zero mean and unit variance, could be well-fitted to the form 
p(a) =/exp (/a +a-e a+) (1) 
(with normalization constants a - -.578 and/ = 1.29), which should, however, be 
corrected at large amplitude (> 5a). Several examples are displayed in Fig. 1. The 
log-amplitude distribution (1) corresponds mathematically to the amplitude distri- 
bution of musical instruments and vocalizations, found to be p(a) = e -a (known as 
the Laplace distribution in speech signal processing), as well as that of background 
sounds, where p(a)  ae -2 (which can be shown to be the band amplitude distri- 
bution for a Gaussian signal). The power spectra of a(t) (Fourier transform of c(-)) 
were found to have a modified 1If form. 
Together with the results for b(t), those findings show that natural sounds are 
distinguished from arbitrary ones by robust characteristics. In the present paper 
we explore to what extent the auditory system exploits them in constructing efficient 
neural codes. Another important point made by (Attias and Schreiner 1997), as well 
as by (Ruderman and Bialek 1994) regarding visual signals, is that natural inputs 
are very often not Gaussian (e.g. (1)), unlike the signals used by conventional 
system-identification methods often applied to the nervous system. In this paper 
we use non-Gaussian stimuli to study auditory coding. 
3 Measuring the Rate of Information Transfer 
3.1 Experiment 
Based on our results for temporal statistics of natural auditory scenes, we can 
construct 'naturalistic' stimuli by starting with a simple signal and systematically 
incorporate successively more complicated characteristics of natural sounds into it.

We chose to use narrow-band stimuli consisting of amplitude-modulated carriers 
a(t) cos(vt) at sound frequencies  = 2 - 9kHz with no phase modulation. Focusing 
on one-point amplitude statistics, we constructed a white naturalistic amplitude 
by choosing a(t) from an exponential distribution with a cutoff, p(0 < a _< ac) cr 
e -a, p(a > ac) -- 0 at each time point t independently, using a cutoff modulation 
frequency of f = 100Hz (i.e., [(f _< f) [= const., [a(f > f) [= 0, where a(f) is 
the Fourier transform of a(t)). We also used a non-naturalistic stimulus set where 
a(t) was chosen from a uniform distribution p(0 _< a _< b) = 1/be, p(a > b) = O, 
with b adjusted so that both stimulus sets had the same mean. A short segment 
from each set is shown in Fig. 1, and the two distributions are plotted in Figs. 3,4 
(right). 
Stimuli of 15 - 20min duration were played to ketamine-anesthetized cats. To 
minimize adaptation effects we alternated between the two sets using 10sec long 
segments. Single-unit recordings were made from the inferior colliculus (IC), a sub- 
thalamic auditory processing stage (e.g., Pickles 1988). Each IC unit responds best 
to a narrow range of sound frequencies, the center of which is called its 'best fre- 
quency' (BF). Neighboring units have similar BF's, in accord with the topographic 
frequency organization of the auditory system. For each unit, stimuli with carrier 
frequency y at most 500Hz away from the unit's BF were used. Firing rates in 
response to those stimuli were between 60- 100Hz. The stimulus and the electrode 
signal were recorded simultaeneously at a sampling rate of 24kHz. After detecting 
and sotring the spikes and extracting the stimulus amplitude, both amplitude and 
spike train were down-sampled to 3kHz. 
3.2 Analysis 
In order to assess the ability to discriminate between different inputs based on the 
observed spike train, we computed the mutual information Ir, s between the spike 
train response r(t) = Y-i 5(t - ti), where ti are the spike times, and the stimulus 
amplitude s(t). I consists of two terms, Ir,s = Hs - Hslr, where Hs is the stimulus
