Abstract 
We have previously presented a coarse-to-fine hierarchical pyra- 
mid/neural network (HPNN) architecture which combines multi- 
scale image processing techniques with neural networks. In this 
paper we present applications of this general architecture to two 
problems in mammographic Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD). 
The first application is the detection of microcalcifications. The 
coarse-to-fine HPNN was designed to learn large-scale context in- 
fbrmation fbr detecting small objects like microcalcifications. Re- 
ceiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis suggests that the 
hierarchical architecture improves detection performance of a well 
established CAD system by roughly 50 %. The second application 
is to detect mammographic masses directly. Since masses are large, 
extended objects, the coarse-to-fine HPNN architecture is not suit- 
able for this problem. Instead we construct a fine-to-coarse HPNN 
architecture which is designed to learn small-scale detail structure 
associated with the extended objects. Our initial results applying 
the fine-to-coarse HPNN to mass detection are encouraging, with 
detection perfbrmance improvements of about 36 %. We conclude 
that the ability of the HPNN architecture to integrate information 
across scales, both coarse-to-fine and fine-to-coarse, makes it well 
suited tbr detecting objects which may have contextual clues or 
detail structure occurring at scales other than the natural scale of 
the object. 
1 Introduction 
In a previous paper [8] we presented a coarse-to-fine hierarchical pyramid/neural 
network (HPNN) architecture that combines multi-scale image processing tech-

niques with neural networks to search for small targets in images (see figure 1A). 
To search an image we apply the network at a position and use its output as an 
estimate of the probability that a target (an object of the class we wish to find) is 
present there. We then repeat this at each position in the image. In the coarse- 
to-fine HPNN, the hidden units of networks operating at low resolution or coarse 
scale learn associated coztext information, since the targets themselves are difficult 
to detect at low resolution. The context is then passed to networks searching at 
higher resolution. The use of context can significantly improve detection perfor- 
mance since small objects have few distinguishing features. In the HPNN each of 
the networks receives information directly from only a small part of several feature 
images, and so the networks can be relatively simple. The network at the highest 
resolution integrates the contextual information learned at coatset resolutions to 
detect the object of interest. 
The HPNN architecture can be extended by considering the implications of inverting 
the infbrmation flow in the coarse-to-fine architecture. This fine-to-coarse HPNN 
would have networks extracting detail structure at fine resolutions of the image 
and then passing this detail information to networks operating at coatset scales 
(see figure lB). For many types of objects, information about the fine structure is 
important for discriminating between different classes. The fine-to-coarse HPNN is 
therefbre a natural architecture for exploiting fine detail information for detecting 
extended objects. 
In this paper, we present our experiences in applying the HPNN framework to 
two problems in mammographic Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD); that of detect- 
ing microcalcifications in mammograms and that of detecting malignant masses in 
mammograms. The coarse-to-fine HPNN architecture is well-suited for the micro- 
calcification problem, while the fine-to-coarse HPNN is suited fbr mass detection. 
We evaluate the performance and utility of the HPNN framework by considering 
its effects on reducing false positive rates in a well characterized CAD system. 
The University of Chicago (UofC) has been actively developing'mammographic 
CAD systems for microcalcification and mass detection [6] and has been evaluating 
their performance clinically. A general block diagram showing the basic processing 
elements of these CAD systems is shown in figure 2. First, a pre-processing step 
is used to segment the breast area and increase the overall signal-to-noise levels in 
the image. Regions of interest (ROIs) are defined at this stage, representing local 
areas of the breast which potentially contain a cluster of microcalcifications or a 
mass. The next stage typically involves feature extraction and rule-based/heuristic 
analysis, in order to prune false positives. The remaining POIs are classified as 
positive or negative by a statistical classifier or neural network. The CAD system 
is used as a second reader, aiding the radiologist by pointing out spots to double 
check. One of the key requirements of CAD is that false positive rates be low 
enough that radiologists will not ignore the CAD system output. Therefore it is 
critical to reduce false positive rates of CAD systems without significant reductions 
in sensitivity. In this paper we evaluate the HPNN framework within the context 
of reducing the false positive rates of the UofC CAD systems for microcalcification 
and mass detection. In both cases the HPNN acts as a post-processor of the UofC 
CAD system. 
2 Microcalcification detection 
Microcalcifications are calcium deposits in breast tissue that appear as very small 
bright dots in mammograms. Clusters of microcalcifications frequently occur around 
tumors. Unfortunately microcalcification clusters are sometimes missed, since they

can be quite subtle and the radiologists can only spend about a minute evaluating 
a patient's mammograms. 
Data used fbr the microcalcification experiments was provided by The University of 
Chicago. The first set of data consists of 50 true positive and 86 false positive POIs. 
These POIs are 99x99 pixels and digitized at 100 micron resolution. A second set 
of data t�om the UofC clinical testing database included 47 true positives and 103 
false positives, also 99x99 and sampled at 100 micron resolution. 
We trained the coarse-to-fine HPNN architecture in figure 1A as a detector fbr indi- 
vidual calcifications. For each level in the pyramid a network is trained, beginning 
with the network at low resolution. The network at a particular pyramid level is 
applied to one pixel at a time in the image at that resolution, and so produces an 
output at each pixel. All of the networks are trained to detect microcalcifications, 
however, at low resolutions the microcalcifications are not directly detectable. To 
achieve better than chance performance, the networks at those levels must learn 
something about the context in which microcalcifications appear. To integrate 
context information with the other tatures the outputs of hidden units from low 
resolution networks are propagated hierarchically as inputs to networks operating 
at higher resolutions. 
Input to the neural networks cone from an integrated feature pyramid (IFP) [1]. 
To construct the IFP, we used steerable filters [3] to compute local orientation 
energy. The steering properties of these filters enable the direct computation of 
the orientation having maximum energy. We constructed features which represent, 
at each pixel location, the maximum energy (energy at 0,,x), the energy at the

network hierarchy. 
In examining the truth data for the ROI data set, we found that the experts who 
specified the microcalcification positions often made errors in these positions of 
up to 4-2 pixels of the correct position. To take this uncertainty in position into 
account, we used the tbllowing error function

is the network's output when applied to position x.) It is essentially the cross- 
entropy error, but for positive examples the probability of generating a positive 
output (j(x), in this case) has been replaced by the probability of generating at 
least one positive output in a region or set of pixels p in the image. In our case each 
p is a five-by-five pixel square centered on the location specified by the expert. To 
this we added the standard weight decay regularization term. The regularization 
constant was adjusted to minimize the ten-fold cross-validation error. 
The coarse-to-fine HPNN was applied to each input ROI, and an image was con- 
structed fi'om the output of the Level 0 network at each pixel. Each of these pixel
