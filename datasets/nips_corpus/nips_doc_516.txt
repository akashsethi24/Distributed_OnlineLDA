Abstract 
Accurate saccades require interaction between brainstem circuitry and the 
cerebellum. A model of this interaction is described, based on Kawato's 
principle of feedback-error-learning. In the model a part of the 
brainstem (the superior colliculus) acts as a simple feedback controller 
with no knowledge of initial eye position, and provides an error signal 
for the cerebellum to correct for eye-muscle nonlinearities. This teaches 
the cerebellum, modelled as a CMAC, to adjust appropriately the gain 
on the brainstem burst-generator's internal feedback loop and so alter the 
size of burst sent to the motoneurons. With direction-only errors the 
system rapidly learns to make accurate horizontal eye movements from 
any starting position, and adapts realistically to subsequent simulated 
eye-muscle weakening or displacement of the saccadic target. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
The use of artificial neural nets (ANNs) to control robot movement offers advantages in 
situations where the relevant analytic solutions are unknown, or where unforeseeable 
changes, perhaps as a result of damage or wear, are likely to occur. It is also a mode of 
control with considerable similarities to those used in biological systems. It may thus 
prove possible to use ideas derived from studies of ANNs in robots to help understand 
how the brain produces movements. This paper describes an attempt to do this for 
saccadic eye movements. 595

The structure of the human retina, with its small foveal area of high acuity, requires 
extensive use of eye-movements to inspect regions of interest. To minimise the time 
during which the retinal image is blurred, these saccadic refixation movements are very 
rapid - too rapid for visual feedback to be used in acquiring the target (Carpenter 1988). 
The saccadic control system must therefore know in advance the size of control signal to 
be sent to the eye muscles. This is a function of both target displacement from the fovea 
and initial eye-position. The latter is important because the eye-muscles and orbital 
tissues are elastic, so that more force is required to move the eye away from the straight- 
ahead position than towards it (Collins 1975). 
Similar rapid movements may be required of robot cameras. Here too the desired control 
signal is usually a function of both target displacement and initial camera positions. 
Experiments with a simulated four degree-of-freedom stereo camera rig have shown that 
appropriate ANN architectures can learn this kind of function reasonably efficiently (Dean 
et al. 1991), provided the nets are given accurate error information. However, this 
information is only available if the relevant equations have been solved; how can ANNs 
be used in situations where this is not the case? 
A possible solution to this kind of problem (derived in part from analysis of biological 
motor control systems) has been suggested by Kawato (1990), and was implemented for 
the simulated stereo camera rig (Fig 1). Two controllers are arranged in

parallel. Target coordinates, together with information about camera positions, are passed 
to an adaptive feedforward controller in the form of an ANN, which then moves the 
cameras. If the movement is inaccurate, the new target coordinates are passed to the 
second controller. This knows nothing of initial camera position, but issues a corrective 
movement command that is simply proportional to target displacement. In the absence of 
the adaptive controller it can be used to home in on the target with a series of saccades:

though each individual saccade is ballistic, the sequence is generated by visual feedback, 
hence the term simple feedback controller. When the adaptive controller is present, 
however, the output of the simple feedback controller can be used not only to generate a 
corrective saccade but also as a motor error signal (Fig 1). Although this error signal is 
not accurate, its imperfections become less important as the ANN learns and so takes on 
more responsibility for the movement (for proof of convergence see Kawato 1990). The 
architecture is robust in that it learns on-line, does not require mathematical knowledge, 
and still functions to some extent when the adaptive controller is untrained or damaged. 
These qualities are also important for control of saccades in biological systems, and it is 
therefore of interest that there are similarities between the architecture shown in Fig 1 and 
the structure of the primate saccadic system (Fig 2). The cerebellum is widely (though

damaged the remaining brainstem structures function like the simple feedback controller 
of Fig 1. Saccarles can still be made, but (i) they are not accurate; (ii) the degree of 
inaccuracy depends on initial eye position; (iii) multiple saccades are required to home in 
on the target; and (iv) the system never recovers (eg Ritchie 1976; Optican and Robinson 
1980). 
These similarities suggest that it is worth exploring the idea that the brainstem teaches 
the cerebellum to make accurate saccades (cf Grossberg and Kuperstein 1986), just as the 
simple feedback controller teaches the adaptive controller in the Kawato architecture. A 
model of the primate system was therefore constructed, using 'off-the-shelf' components 
wired together in accordance with known anatomy and physiology, and its performance 
assessed under a variety of conditions.

2 STRUCTURE OF MODEL 
The overall structure of the model is shown in Fig 3. It has three main components: a 
simple feedback controller, a burst generator, and a CMAC. The simple feedback

controller sends a signal proportional to target displacement from the fovea to the burst 
generator. The function of the burst generator is to translate this signal into an 
appropriate command for the eye muscles, and it is based here on the model of Robinson 
(Robinson 1975; van Gisbergen et al. 1981). Its output is a rapid burst of neural 
impulses, the frequency of which is esentially a velocity command. A crucial feature of 
Robinson's model is an internal feedback loop, in which the output of the generator is 
integrated and compared with the input command. The saccade terminates when the two 
are equal. This system ensures that the generator gives the output matching the input 
command in the face of disturbances that might alter burst frequency and hence saccade 
velocity. 
The simple feedback controller sends to the CMAC (Albus 1981) a copy of its command 
to the burst generator. The CMAC (Cerebellar Model Arithmetic Computer) is a neural 
net model of the cerebellum incoporating theories of cerebellar function proposed 
independently by Mart (1969) and Albus (1971). Its function is to learn a mapping 
between a multidimensional input and a single-valued output, using a form of lookup 
table with local interpolation. The entries in the lookup table are modified using the delta 
rule, by an error signal which is either the difference between desired and actual output or 
some estimate of that difference. CMACs have been used successfully in a number of 
Adaptive Control of Saccadic Accuracy by Primate Cerebellum and Brainstem 599 
applications concerning prediction or control (eg Miller et al. 1987; Hormel 1990). In 
the present case the function to be learnt is that relating desired saccade amplitude and 
initial eye position (inputs) to gain adjustment in the internal feedback loop of the burst 
generator (output). 
The correspondences between the model structure and the anatomy and physiology of the 
primate saccadic system are as follows. 
(1) The simple feedback controller represents the superior colliculus. 
(2) The burst generator corresponds to groups of neurons located in the brainstem. 
(3) The CMAC models a particular region of cerebellar cortex, the posterior vermis. 
(4) The pathway conveying a copy of the feedback controllet's crude command corresponds 
to the projection from the superior colliculus to the nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis, 
which in turn sendes a mossy fibre projection to the posterior vermis. 
Space precludes detailed evaluation of the substantial evidence supporting the above 
correspondences (see eg Wurtz and Goldberg 1989). The remaining two connections have 
a less secure basis.
