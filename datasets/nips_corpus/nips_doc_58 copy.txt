ABSTRACT 
Intracellular recordings in spinal cord motoneurons and cerebral 
cortex neurons have provided new evidence on the correlational strength of 
monosynaptic connections, and the relation between the shapes of 
postsynaptic potentials and the associated increased firing probability. In 
these cells, excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) produce cross- 
correlogram peaks which resemble in large part the derivative of the EPSP. 
Additional synaptic noise broadens the peak, but the peak area -- i.e., the 
number of above-chance firings triggered per EPSP -- remains proportional to 
the EPSP amplitude. A typical EPSP of 100 gv triggers about .01 firings per 
EPSP. The consequences of these data for information processing by 
polysynaptic connections is discussed. The effects of sequential polysynaptic 
links can be calculated by convolving the effects of the underlying 
monosynaptic connections. The net effect of parallel pathways is the sum of 
the individual contributions. 
INTRODUCTION 
Interactions between neurons are determined by the strength and 
distribution of their synaptic connections. The strength of synaptic 
interactions has been measured directly in the central nervous system by two 
techniques. Intracellular recording reveals the magnitude and time course of 
postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) produced by synaptic connections, and cross- 
correlation of extracellular spike trains measures the effect of the PSP's on the 
firing probability of the connected cells. The relation between the shape of 
excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) and the shape of the cross- 
correlogram peak they produce has been empirically investigated in cat 
motoneurons 2,4,5 and in neocortical cells 10. 
RELATION BETWEEN EPSP'S AND CORRELOGRAM PEAKS 
Synaptic interactions have been studied most thoroughly in spinal 
cord motoneurons. Figure I illustrates the membrane potential of a 
rhythmically firing motoneuron, and the effect of EPSPs on its firing. An 
EPSP occurring sufficiently close to threshold (�) will cause the motoneuron 
to fire and will advance an action potential to its rising edge (top). 
Mathematical analysis of this threshold-crossing process predicts that an 
EPSP with shape e(t) will produce a firing probability f(t), which resembles

the derivative of the EPSP 4,8. Specifically, for smooth membrane potential 
trajectories approaching threshold (the case of no additional synaptic noise): 
f(t) = fo + fro/:g) de/dt 
(1) 
where fo is the baseline firing rate of the motoneuron and ' is the rate of 
closure between motoneuron membrane potential and threshold. This 
relation can be derived analytically by tranforming the process to a 
coordinate system aligned with the EPSP (Fig. 1, middle) and calculating the 
relative timing of spikes advanced by intercepts of the threshold trajectories 
with the EPSP 4. The above relation (1) is also valid for the correlogram 
trough during the falling ph. ase of the EPSP, as long as de/dt > -{'; if the EPSP 
falls more rapidly than -v, the trough is limited at zero firing rate (as 
illustrated for the correlogram at bottom). The fact that the shape of the 
correlogram peak above baseline matches the EPSP derivative has been 
empirically confirmed for large E?S?s in cat motoneurons 4. This relation 
implies that the height of the correlogram peak above baseline is proportional 
to the EPS? rate of rise. The integral of this relationship predicts that the area 
between the correlogram peak and baseline is proportional to the EPSP 
amplitude. This linear relation further implies that the effects of 
simultaneously arriving EPSPs will add linearly. 
The presence of additional background synaptic noise, which is 
normally produced by randomly occurring synaptic inputs, tends to make the 
correlogram peak broader than the duration of the EPSP risetime. This 
broadening is produced by membrane potential fluctuations which cause 
additional threshold crossings during the decay of the EPSP by trajectories 
that would have missed the EPSP (e.g., the dashed trajectory in Fig. 1, 
middle). On the basis of indirect empirical comparisons it has been proposed 
6,7 that the broader correlogram peaks can be described by the sum of two 
linear functions of e(t): 
f(t) = fo + a e(t) + b de/dt 
(2) 
This relation provides a reasonable match when the coefficients (a and b) can 
be optimized for each case 5,7, but direct empirical comparisons 2,4 indicate 
that the difference between the correlogram peak and the derivative is 
typically briefer than the EPSP. 
The effect of synaptic noise on the transform 'between EPSP and 
correlogram peak has not yet been analytically derived (except for the case of 
Gaussian noisel). However the threshold-crossing process has been 
simulated by a computer model which adds synaptic noise to the trajectories 
intercepting the EPSP 1. The correlograms generated by the simulation match 
the correlograms measured empirically for small EPS?'s in motoneurons 2, 
confirming the validity of the model. 
Although synaptic noise distributes the triggered firings over a wider 
peak, the area of the correlogram peak, i.e., the number of motoneuron firings 
produced by an EPSP, is essentially preserved and remains proportional to 
EPSP amplitude for moderate noise levels. For unitary EPSP's (produced by 
273 
a single afferent fiber) in cat motoneurons, the number of firings triggered per 
EPSP (Np) was linearly related to the amplitude (h) of the EPSP 2: 
Np = (0.1/mv)o h (mv) + .003 
(3) 
The fact that the number of triggered spikes increases in proportion to E?S? 
amplitude has also been confirmed for neocortical neurons 10; for cells 
recorded in sensorimotor cortex slices (probably pyramidal cells) the 
coefficient of h was very similar: 0.07/rev. This means that a typical unitary 
EPSP with amplitude of 100 gv, raises the probability that the postsynaptic 
cell fires by less than .01. Moreover, this increase occurs during a specific 
time interval corresponding to the rise time of the EPS? - on the order of 1 - 2 
msec. The net increase in firing rate of the postsynaptic cell is calculated by 
the proportional decrease in interspike intervals produced by the triggered 
spikes 4. (While the above values are typical, unitary EPSP's range in size 
from several hundred gv down to undetectable levels of several gv., and 
have risetimes of .2 - 4 msec.) 
Inhibitory connections between cells, mediated by inhibitory 
postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs), produce a trough in the cross-correlogram. 
This reduction of firing probability below baseline is followed by a 
subsequent broad, shallow peak, representing the spikes that have been 
delayed during the IPSP. Although the effects of inhibitory connections 
remain to be analyzed more quantitatively, preliminary results indicate that 
small IPSP's in synaptic noise produce decreases in firing probability that are 
similar to the increases produced by EPS?'s 4,5. 
DISYNAPTIC LINKS 
The effects of polysynaptic links between neurons can be understood 
as combinations of the underlying monosynaptic connections. A 
monosynaptic connection from cell A to cell B would produce a first-order 
cross-correlation peak Pi(B[A,t), representing the conditional probability that 
neuron B fires above chance at time t, given a spike in cell A at time t = 0. As 
noted above, the shape of this first-order correlogram peak is largely 
proportional to the E?S? derivative (for cells whose interspike interval 
exceeds the duration of the EPSP). The latency of the peak is the conduction 
time from A to B (Fig. 2 top left). 
In contrast, several types of disynaptic linkages between A and B, 
mediated by a third neuron C, will produce a second-order correlation peak 
between A and B. A disynaptic link may be produced by two serial 
monosynaptic connections, from A to C and from C to B (Fig. 2, bottom left), 
or by a common synaptic input from C ending on both A and B (Fig. 2, 
bottom right). In both cases, the second-order correlation between A and B 
produced by the disynaptic link would be the convolution of the two first- 
order correlations between the monosynaptically connected cells: 
P2(BIA) = P(BIC) OP(CIA) (4) 
274 
As indicated by the diagram, the cross-correlogram peak P2(BIA,t) would be 
smaller and more dispersed than the peaks of the underlying first-order 
correlation peaks. For serial connections the peak would appear to the right 
of the origin, at a latency that is the sum of the two monosynaptic latencies. 
The peak produced by a common input typically straddles the origin, since its 
timing reflects the difference between the underlying latencies.
