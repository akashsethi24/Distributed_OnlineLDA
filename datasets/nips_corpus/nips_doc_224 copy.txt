ABSTRACT
Cascadable, CMOS synapse chips containing a cross-bar array of 
32x32 (1024) programmable synapses have been fabricated as 
'uilding blocks for fully parallel implementation of neural 
networks. The synapses are based on a hybrid digital-analog 
design which utilizes on-chip 7-bit data latches to store quantized 
weights and two-quadrant multiplying DAC's to compute weighted 
outputs. The synapses exhibit 6-bit resolution and excellent 
monotonicity and consistency in their transfer characteristics. A 
64-neuron hardware incorporating four synapse chips has been 
fabricated to investigate the performance of feedback networks in 
optimization problem solving. In this study, a 7x7, one-to-one 
assignment net and the Hopfield-Tank 8-city traveling salesman 
problem net have been implemented in the hardware. The 
network's ability to obtain optimum or near optimum solutions in 
real time has been demonstrated. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
A large number of electrically modifiable synapses is often required for fully 
parallel analog neural network hardware. Electronic synapses based on CMOS, 
EEPROM, as well as thin film technologies are actively being developed [1-5]. 
One preferred approach is based on a hybrid digital-analog design which can easily 
be implemented in CMOS with simple interface and analog circuitry. The hybrid 
design utilizes digital memories to store the synaptic weights and digital-to-analog 
converters to perform analog multiplication. A variety of synaptic chips based on 
such hybrid designs have been developed and used as building blocks' in larger 
neural network hardware systems fabricated at JPL. 
In this paper, the design and operational characteristics of the hybrid synapse chips 
are described. The development of a 64-neuron hardware incorporating several of 
770 Moopenn, Duong and Thakoor 
the synapse chips is also discussed. Finally, a hardware implementation of two 
global optimization nets, namely, the one-to-one assignment optimization net and 
the Hopfield-Tank traveling salesman net [6], and their performance based on our 
64-neuron hardware are discussed. 
2 CHIP DESIGN AND ELECTRIC CHARACTERIS 
The basic design and operational characteristics of the hybrid digital analog synapse 
chips are described in this section. A simplified block diagram of the chips is 
shown in Fig. 1. The chips consist of an address/data de-multiplexer, row and 
column address decoders, 64 analog input/output lines, and 1024 synapse cells 
arranged in the form of a 32x32 cross-bar matrix. The synapse cells along the i- 
th row have a common output, x i, and similarly, synapses along the j-th column 
have a common input, yj. The synapse input/output lines are brought off-chip for 
multi-chip expansion to a larger synaptic matrix. The synapse cell, based on a 
hybrid digital analog design, essentially consists of a 7-bit static latch and a 7-bit, 
two-quadrant multiplying DAC.

A circuit diagram of the 7-bit DAC is shown in Fig. 2. The DAC consists of a 
current input circuit, a set of binary weighted current sources, and a current 
steering circuit. The current in the input circuit is mirrored by the binary-weighted 
current sources for all synapses along a column. In one version of the chips, a 
single long-channel FET is used to convert the synapse input voltage to a current. 
In addition, the gate of the transistor is connected internally to the gates of other 
long channel transistors. This common gate is accessable off-chip and provides a 
means for controlling the overall gain of the synapses in the chip. In a second 
chip version, an external resistor is employed to perform input voltage to current 
conversion when a high linearity in the synapse transfer characteristics is desired. 
Digital-Analog Hybrid Synapse Chips for Electronic Neural Networks 771 
Hybrid 32x32x7-bit synapse chips with and without long channel transistors were 
fabricated through MOSIS using a 2-micron, n-well CMOS process. Typical 
measured synapse response (I-V) curves from these chips are shown in Figs. 3a and 
3b for weight values of 0, +/- 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, and 63. The curves in Fig. 3a were 
obtained for a synapse incorporating an on-chip long-channel FET with a gate bias 
of 5 volts. The non-linear synapse response is evident and can be seen to be 
similar to that of a threshold current source. The non-linear behavior is mainly 
attributed to the nonlinear drain characteristics of the long channel transistor. It 
should be pointed out that synapses with such characteristics are especially suited 
for neural networks with neurons operating in the high gain limit, in which case, 
the nonlinearity may even be desirable. The set of curves in Fig. 3b were obtained 
using an external 10-megaohm resistor for the V-I conversion. For input voltages 
greater than about twice the transistor's threshold voltage (--- 0.8 v), the synapse's 
current output is a highly linear function of the input voltage. The linear 
characteristics achieved with the use of external resistors would be applicable in 
feedfoard nets with learning capabilities.

Figure 4 shows the measured output of the synapse as the weight is incremented 
from -60 to +60. The synapse exhibits excellent monotonicity and step size 
consistency. Based on a random sampling of synapses from several chips, the step 
size standard deviation due to mismatched transistor characteristics is typically less 
than 25 percent. 
3 64-NEURON HARDWARE 
The hybrid synapse chips are ideally suited for hardware implementation of 
feedback neural networks for combinatorial global optimization problem solving 
or associative recall where the synaptic weights are known a priori. For example, 
in a Hopfield-type feedback net [7], the weights can be calculated directly from a 
set of cost parameters or a set of stored vectors. The desired weights are 
772 Moopenn, Duong and Thakoor 
quantized and downloaded into the memories of the synapse chips. On the other 
hand, in supervised learning applications, learning can be performed off-line, taking 
into consideration the operating characteristics of the synapses, and the new 
updated weights are simply reprogrammed into the synaptic hardware during each 
training cycle.

Digital-Analog Hybrid Synapse Chips for Electronic Neural Networks 773 
A 64-neuron breadboard system incorporating several of the hybrid synapse chips 
has been fabricated to demonstrate the utility of these building block chips, and to 
investigate the dynamical properties, global optimization problem solving abilities, 
and application potential of neural networks. The system consists of an array of 
64 discrete neurons and four hybrid synapse chips connected to form a 64x64 cross- 
bar synapse matrix. Each neuron is an operational-amplifier operating as a current 
summing amplifier. A circuit model of a neuron with some synapses is shown in 
Fig. 5. The system dynamical equations are given by: 
r fdVi/dt = gTijVj- V i + RfI i, 
where V i is the output of the neuron i, Tij is the synaptic weight from neuron j 
to neuron i, Rf and Cf are the feedback resistance and capacitance of the neuron, 
rf = Rf Cf, and I i is the external input current. For our system, Rf was about 50 
kilo-ohms, and Cf was about 10 pF, a value large enough to ensure stability against 
oscillations. The system was interfaced to a microcomputer which allows 
downloading of the synaptic weight data and analog readout of the neuron states.

4 GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION NEURAL NETS 
Two combinatorial global optimization problems, namely, the one-to-one 
assignment problem and the traveling salesman problem, were selected for our 
neural net hardware implementation study. Of particular interest is the 
performance of the optimization network in terms of the quality and speed of 
solutions in light of hardware limitations. 
In the one-to-one assignment problem, given two sets of N elements and a cost 
assignment matrix, the objective is to assign each element in one set to an element 
in the second set so as to minimize the total assignment cost. In our neural net 
implementation, the network is a Hopfield-type feedback net consisting of an NxN 
array of assignment neurons. In this representation, a permissible set of one-to- 
one assignments corresponds to a permutation matrix. Thus, lateral inhibition 
774 Moopenn, Duong and Thakoor 
between assignment neurons is employed to ensure that there is only one active 
neuron in each row and in each column of the neuron array. To force the network 
to favor assignment sets with low total assignment cost, each assignment neuron 
is also given an analog prompt, that is, a fxed analog excitation proportional to 
a positive constant minus its assignment cost.
