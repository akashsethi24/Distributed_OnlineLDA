Abstract 
A neural network based approach is presented for controlling two distinct 
types of nonlinear systems. The first corresponds to nonlinear systems 
with parametric uncertainties where the parameters occur nonlinearly. 
The second corresponds to systems for which stabilizing control struc- 
tures cannot be determined. The proposed neural controllers are shown 
to result in closed-loop system stability under certain conditions. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
The problem that we address here is the control of general nonlinear dynamic systems 
in the presence of uncertainties. Suppose the nonlinear dynamic system is described as 
5:= f(x, u, 0) , y = h(x, u, 0) where u denotes an external input, y is the output, x is the 
state, and 0 is the parameter which represents constant quantities in the system. The control 
objectives are to stabilize the system in the presence of disturbances and to ensure that 
reference trajectories can be tracked accurately, with minimum delay. While uncertainties 
can be classified in many different ways, we focus here on two scenarios. One occurs 
because the changes in the environment and operating conditions introduce uncertainties 
in the system parameter 0. As a result, control objectives such as regulation and tracking, 
which may be realizable using a continuous function u = ?(x, 0) cannot be achieved since 
0 is unknown. Another class of problems arises due to the complexity of the nonlinear 
function f. Even if 0, f and h can be precisely determined, the selection of an appropriate 
? that leads to stabilization and tracking cannot be made in general. In this paper, we 
present two methods based on neural networks which are shown to be applicable to both 
the above classes of problems. In both cases, we clearly outline the assumptions made, 
the requirements for adequate training of the neural network, and the class of engineering 
problems where the proposed methods are applicable. The proposed approach significantly 
expands the scope of neural controllers in relation to those proposed in (Narendra and 
Parthasarathy, 1990; Levin and Narendra, 1993; Sanner and S!otine, 1992; Jordan and 
Rumelhart, 1992). 
Neural Control for Nonlinear Dynamic Systems 1 O11 
The first class of problems we shall consider includes nonlinear systems with parametric 
uncertainties. The field of adaptive control has addressed such a problem, and over the 
past thirty years, many results have been derived pertaining to the control of both linear 
and nonlinear dynamic systems (Narendra and Annaswamy, 1989). A common assumption 
in almost all of the published work in this field is that the uncertain parameters occur 
linearly. In this paper, we consider the control of nonlinear dynamic systems with nonlinear 
parametrizations. We design a neural network based controller that adapts to the parameter 
8 and show that closed-loop system stability can be achieved under certain conditions. Such 
a controller will be referred to as a 8-adaptive neural controller. Pertinent results to this 
class are discussed in section 2. 
The second class of problems includes nonlinear systems, which despite being completely 
known, cannot be stabilized by conventional analytical techniques. The obvious method for 
stabilizing nonlinear systems is to resort to linearization and use linear control design meth- 
ods. This limits the scope of operation of the stabilizing controller. Feedback linearization 
is another method by which nonlinear systems can be stably controlled (Isidori, 1989). This 
however requires fairly stringent set of conditions to be satisfied by the functions f and h. 
Even after these conditions are satisfied, one cannot always find a closed-form solution to 
stabilize the system since it is equivalent to solving a set of partial differential equations. 
We consider in this paper, nonlinear systems, where system models as well as parameters 
are known, but controller structures are unknown. A neural network based controller is 
shown to exist and trained so that a stable closed-loop system is achieved. We denote this 
class of controllers as a stable neural controller. Pertinent results to this class are discussed 
in section 3. 
2 O-ADAPTIVE NEURAL CONTROLLER 
The focus of the nonlinear adaptive controller to be developed in this paper is on dynamic 
systems that can be written in the d-step ahead predictor form as follows: 
y+d = 0) (1) 
where 0.,t r --- [yt,',yt-+,u,-,'.',ut-m-,+], n _> 1, m > O, d > 1, m + d = n, 
y, b/ C  containing the origin and � C k are open, f � Y x L/ +d x �1  , yt 
and ut are the output and the input of the system at time t respectively, and 8 is an unknown 
parameter and occurs nonlinearly in f. The goal is to choose a control input 'u such that 
the system in (1) is stabilized and the plant output is regulated around zero.

For every 8 E O, f(0, 0, 8) = 0. 
There exist open and convex neighborhoods of the origin 3;2 C Y and b/2 C b/l, an

that xtT(ATpA,- P)xt+ ['TBTpB,+ 2xtTATPB,� ' <_ -xtTQxt, where 
fc = [0, a: 0, o)] r. 
Since the objective is to control the system in (1) where 0 is unknown, in order to stabilize 
the output y at the origin with an estimate Or, we choose the control input as 
ut = g(wt, 0,

2.1 PARAMETER ESTIMATION SCHEME 
Suppose the estimation algorithm for updating 0 is defined recursively as A0 zx 0 - 
't- = R(yt,wt-d, ut-d,t-) the problem is to determine the function R such that 0 
converges to 0 asymptotically. In general,  is chosen to depend on t, wt-a, 2tt-d and 
t- since they are measurable and contain information regarding 0. For example, in the 
case of linear systems which can be cast in the input predictor form, ut = 00, a well- 
known linear parameter estimation method is to adjust  as (Goodwin and Sin, 1984) 
A0 - '- ' 
- +_,,,_,, [ut-a - �Lat-]. In other words, the mechanism for carrying out 
parameter estimation is realized by R. In the case of general nonlinear systems, the task 
of determining such a function R is quite difficult, especially when the parameters occur 
nonlinearly. Hence, we propose the use of a neural network parameter estimation algorithm 
denoted 0-adaptive neural network (TANN) (Annaswamy and Yu, 1996). That is, we adjust 
as 
{ t- +N(Yt,t-d,ut-d,O-,) ifAVd, <-e 
Ot : t--I otherwise (3) 
where the inputs of the neural network are t, wt-a, nt-a and ,_ 1, the output is A0, and 
 defines a dead-zone where parameter adaptation stops. 
The neural network is to be trained so that the resulting network can improve the pa- 
rameter estimation over time for any possible 0 in a compact set. In addition, the 
trained network must ensure that the overall system in Eqs. (1), (2) and (3) is stable. 
Toward this end, N in TANN algorithm is required to satisfy the following two proper-

of parameter variation. 
2.2 TRAINING OF TANN FOR CONTROL 
In the previous section, we proposed an algorithm using a neural network for adjusting 
the control parameters. We introduced two properties (P1) and (P2) of the identification 
algorithm that the neural network needs to possess in order to maintain stability of the 
closed-loop system. In this section, we discuss the training procedure by which the weights 
of the neural network are to be adjusted so that the network retains these properties. 
The training set is constructed off-line and should compose of data needed in the train- 
ing phase. If we want the algorithm in Eq. (3) to be valid on the specified sets Y. and 
L/., for various 0 and 0 in �., the training set should cover those variables appearing in 
n 
Eq. (3) in their respective ranges. Hence, we first sample 0 in the set y. x , ,

and 0,  in the set 133. Their values are, say, wl, 01 and  respectively. For the 
particular 0 and 0 we sample 0 again in the set {0 
and its value is, say, '. Once w,, 0, ' and  are sampled, other data can then 
be calculated, such as ul = K(w,0,') and y = f(w, ul,0). We can also ob- 
tain the corresponding C(r}) = o: )2

element can then be formed as (yl, w ,u, ', 01, AVa, L ). Proceeding in the same man- 
ner, by choosing various w,, 0,,
