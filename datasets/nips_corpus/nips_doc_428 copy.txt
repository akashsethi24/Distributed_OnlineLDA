Abstract 
Feature selective cells in the primary visual cortex of several species are or- 
ganized in hierarchical topographic maps of stimulus features like position 
in visual space, orientation and ocular dominance. In order to un- 
derstand and describe their spatial structure and their development, we in- 
vestigate a self-organizing neural network model based on the feature map 
algorithm. The model explains map formation as a dimension-reducing 
mapping from a high-dimensional feature space onto a two-dimensional 
lattice, such that similarity between features (or feature combinations) 
is translated into spatial proximity betveen the corresponding feature 
selective cells. The model is able to reproduce several aspects of the spatial 
structure of cortical maps in the visual cortex. 
1 Introduction 
Cortical maps are functionally defined structures of the cortex, vhich are charac- 
terized by an ordered spatial distribution of functionally specialized cells along the 
cortical surface. In the primary visual area(s) the response properties of these cells 
must be described by several independent features, and there is a strong tendency to 
map combinations of these features onto the cortical surface in a way that translates 
similarity into spatial proximity of the corresponding feature selective cells (see 
e.g. [1-6]). A neighborhood preserving mapping between a high-dimensional fea- 
ture space and the two dimensional cortical surface, however, cannot be achieved, so 
the spatial structure of these maps is a compromise, preserving some neighborhood 
relations at the expense of others. 
The compromise realized in the primary visual area(s) is a hierarchical represen- 
tation of features. The variation of the secondary features preferred orientation, 
11

orientation specifity and ocular dominance is highly repetitive across the pt/- 
mary map of retinal location, giving rise to a large number of small maps, each 
containing a complete representation of the full range of the secondary features. If 
the neighborhood relations in feature space are to be preserved and maps must be 
continuous, the spatial distributions of the secondary features orientation prefer- 
ence, orientation specifity and ocular dominance can no longer be independent. 
Interestingly, [here is experimental evidence in the ma. ca.que that this is the case, 
namely, that regions with smooth change in one feature (e.g. ocular dominance) 
correlate with regions of rapid change in another feature (e.g. orientation) [7,8]. 
Preliminary results [9] indicate that these correlations may be a natural consequence 
of a dimension reducing mapping which preserves neighborhood relations. 
In a previous study, we investigated a model for the joint formation of a retino- 
topic projection and an orientation column system [10], which is based on the 
self-organizing feature map algorithm [11,12]. This algorithm generates a repre- 
sentation of a given manifold in feature space on a neural network with prespecified 
topology (in our case a two-dimensional sheet), such that the mapping is continous, 
smooth and neighborhood relations are preserved to a large extent.  The model 
has the advantage that its rules can be derived froin biologically plausible devel- 
opmental principles [15,16]. Therefore, it can be interpreted not only as a pattern 
model, which generates a representation of feature combinations subject to a set of 
constraints, but also as a pattern formation model, which describes an input driven 
developmental process. In this contribution ve will extend our previous work by the 
addition of another secondary feature, ocular dominance and we will concentrate 
on the hierarchical mapping of feature combinations as a function of the set of input 
patterns. 
2 Description of the Model 
In our model the cortical surface is divided into N x N small patches, units if, which 
are arranged on a two-dimensional lattice (network layer) with periodic boundary 
conditions (to avoid edge effects). The functional properties of neurons located in 
each patch are characterized by a feature vector Jr, which is associated with each 
unit , and whose components (r)k are interpreted as receptive field properties of 
these neurons. The feature vectors, Jr, as a function of unit locations F, describe the 
spatial distribution of feature selective cells over the cortical layer, i.e. the cortical 
map. 
To generate a representation of features along the network layer, we use the self- 
organizing feature map algorithm [1,2]. This algorithm follows an iterative proce- 
dure. At each step an input vector O', which is of the same dimensionality as Jr, 
is chosen at random according to a probability distribution P('). Then the unit 
', whose feature vector Jr is,closest to the input pattern 5', is selected and the 
components (r)k of it's feature vector are changed according to the feature map 
learning rule: 
,:(t + 1) = Jr(t) + e(t)hO',t)(5'-,:(t)) 
For other modelling approa.ches along these lines see [13,14].

3 Coding of Receptive Field Properties 
In the following ve describe the receptive field properties by the feature vector ,.- 
given by Z,.- = (xr-, Yr-, q,--cos(20r-), qr-sin(20,.-), z,.-) wilere (x, y,.-) denotes the 
position of the receptive field centers in visual space, (0') the preferred orientation, 
and (q,.-), (z) txvo quantities, which qualitatively can be interpreted as orientation 
specificity (see e.g. [17]) and ocular donfinance (see e.g. [18]). If qr is zero, then the 
units are unspecific for orientation; the larger q,.- becomes, the sharper the units are 
tuned. Binocular units are characterized by zr = 0, monocular units by a large 
positive or negative value of z,?. Similarity betveen receptive field properties is 
then given by the euclidean distance between the corresponding feature vectors. 
Tile components ,.- of the input vector ï¿½ = (x, y, qcos(20), qsin(2O), z) describe 
stimulus features which should be represented by the cells in the cortical map. 
They denote position in the visual field (z, y), orientation , and two quantities q 
and z qualitatively describing pattern eccentricity and the distribution of activity 
betxveen both eyes, respectively. Round stimuli are characterized by q = 0 and the 
more eliptic a pattern is the larger is the value of q. A binocular stimulus is 
characterized by z = 0, while a monocular stinmlus is characterized by a large 
positive or negative value of z for right eye or left eye preferred, respectively. 
Input vectors were chosen with equal probability from the manifold 
V: {ffl x,  e [0, d]; q5 e[O, 7r]; q: qp.t; - 
i.e. all feature combinations characterized by a fixed value of q and Iz[ xvere selected 
equally often. If the model is interpreted from a developmental point of view, the 
manifold V describes properties of (subcortical) activity patterns, which drive map 
formation. The quantities d, qp,t and z.,at determine the feature combinations to 
be represented by the map. As we will see below, their values crucially influence 
the spatial structure of the feature map. 
4 Hierarchical Maps 
If qp,t and zp.t are smaller than a certain threshold then orientation preference, 
orientation selectivity and ocular dominance are not represented in the map (i.e. 
qr: z,.-. = 0) but fluctuate around a stationary state of eq. (1), which corresponds 
to a perfect topographic representation of visual space. In this parameter regime, 
the requirement of a continous dimension-reducing map leads to the suppression of 
the additional features orientation and ocular dominance. 
Let us consider an ensemble of networks, each characterized by a set {.} of feature 
vectors, and denote the time-dependent distribution function of this ensemble by 
14 Obermayer, Ritter, and Schulten 
$(,t). Following a method derived in [19], we can describe the time-development 
of $(tF, t) near the stationary state by the Fokker-Planck equation

where the origin of $(.,t) was shifted to the stationary state {vt), using now the 
new argument variable g- = .- t. The eigenvalues of __ determine the stability 
of the stationary state, the topographic representation, while B_. and __D together 
govern size and time development of fluctuations < uFiu. j >.

Let us define the Fourier modes ffi of the equilibrium deviations fit by ff = 
1/N .eik'ff '. For small values of qpat and Zrat the eigenvalues of B are all neg- 
ative, hence the topographic stationary state is stable. If qpat and Zrat are larger

For an isotropic neighborhood function (O'hl -- O'h2 -' O'h) , the matrices /() and
