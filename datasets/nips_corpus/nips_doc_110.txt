ABSTRACT 
We analyze a mathematical model for retinal directionally selective 
cells based on recent electrophysiological data, and show that its 
computation of motion direction is robust against noise and speed. 
INTRODUCTION 
Directionally selective retinal ganglion cells discriminate direction of visual motion 
relatively independently of speed (Amthor and Grzywacz, 1988a) and with high 
contrast sensitivity (Grzywacz, Arethor, and Mistler, 1989). These cells respond 
well to motion in the preferred direction, but respond poorly to motion in the 
opposite, nnll, direction. 
There is an increasing amount of experimental work devoted to these cells. 
Three findings are particularly relevant for this paper: 1- An inhibitory process 
asymmetric to every point of the receptive field underlies the directional selectivity 
of ON-OFF ganglion cells of the rabbit retina (Barlow and Levick, 1965). This 
distributed inhibition allows small motions anywhere in the receptive field center 
to elicit directionally selective responses. 2- The dendritic tree of directionally 
selective ganglion cells is highly branched and most of its dendrites are very fine 
(Amthor, Oyster and Takahashi, 1984; Arethor, Takahashi, and Oyster, 1988). 3- 
The distributions of excitatory and inhibitory synapses along these cells' dendritic 
tree appear to overlap. (Famiglietti, 1985). 
Our own recent experiments elucidated some of the spatiotemporal properties of 
these cells' receptive field. In contrast to excitation, which is transient with stimulus, 
the inhibition is sustained and might arise from sustained amacrine cells (Arethor 
and Grzywacz, 1988a). Its spatial distribution is wide, extending to the borders 
of the receptive field center (Grzywacz and Arethor, 1988). Finally, the inhibition 
seems to be mediated by a high-gain shunting, not hyperpolarizing, synapse, that 
is, a synapse whose reversal potential is close to cell's resting potential (Arethor 
and Grzywacz, 1989).

In spite of this large amount of experimentM work, theoretical efforts to put 
these pieces of evidence into a single framework have been virtually inexistent. 
We propose a directional selectivity model based on our recent data on the 
inhibition's spatiotemporal and nonlinear properties. This model, which is an elab- 
oration of the model of Torre and Poggio (1978), seems to account for several 
phenomena related to retinal directional selectivity. 
THE MODEL 
Figure 1 illustrates the new model for retinal directional selectivity. In this model, 
a stimulns moving in the nnll direction progressively activates receptive field regions 
linked to synapses feeding progressively more distal dendrites Of the ganglion cells. 
Every point in the receptive field center activates adjacent excitatory a/td inhibitory 
synapses. The inhibitory synapses are assumed to canse shunting inhibition. (We 
also formulated a pre-ganglionic version of this model, which however, is outside 
the scope of this paper).

FIGURE 1. The new model for retinal directional selectivity. 
This model is different than that of Poggio and Koch (1987), where the motion axis is 
represented as a sequence of activation of different dendrites. Furthermore, in their 
model, the inhibitory synapses must be closer to the soma than the excitatory ones. 
(However, our model is similar a model proposed, and argued against, elsewhere 
(Koch, Poggio, and Torre, 1982). 
An advantage of our model is that it accounts for the large inhibitory areas to 
most points of the receptive field (Grzywacz and Arethor, 1988). Also, in the new 
model, the distributions of the excitatory and inhibitory synapses overlap along the 
dendritic tree, as suggested (Famiglietti, 1985). Finally, the dendritic tree of ON- 
OFF directionally selective ganglion cells (inset- Amthor, Oyster, and Takahashi, 
A ComputationsJly Robust Anatomical Model 479 
1984) is consistent with our model. The tree's fine dendrites favor the multiplicity 
of directional selectivity and help to deal with noise (see below). 
In this paper, we make calculations with an unidimensional version of the model 
dealing with motions in the preferred and null directions. Its receptive field maps 
into one dendrite of the cell. Set the origin of coordinates of the receptive field to be 
the point where a dot moving in the null direction enters the receptive field. Let $ 
be the size of the receptive field. Next, set the origin of coordinates in the dendrite 
to be the soma and let /, be the length of the dendrite. The model postulates that 
a point z in the receptive field activates excitatory and inhibitory synapses in point 
:e = z,/$ of the dendrite. 
The voltages in the presynaptic sites are assumed to be linearly related to the 
stimulus, �(z,t), that is, there are functions f(t) and fi(t) such that the excitatory, 
/3,(t), and inhibitory, /3i(t), presynaptic voltages of the synapses to position a in 
the dendrite are 
where . stands for convolution. We assume that the integral of fe is zero, (the 
excitation is transient), and that the integral of fi is positive. (In practice, gamma 
distribution functions for fi and the derivatives of such functions for fe were used 
in this paper's simulations.) 
The model postulates that the excitatory, g, and inhibitory, gi, postsynaptic 
conductances are rectified functions of the presynaptic voltages. In some examples, 
we use the hyperbolic tangent as the rectification function: 
71 j =e,i, 
gi('t) = 1 
where 7i and / are constants. In other examples, we use the rectification functions 
described in Grzywacz and Koch (1987), and their model of ON-OFF rectifications. 
For the postsynaptic site, we assume, without loss of generality, zero reversal 
potential and neglect the effect of capacitors (justified by the slow time-courses of 
excitation and inhibition). 
Also, we assume that the inhibitory synapse leads to shunting inhibition, that 
is, its conductance is not in series with a battery. Let E be the voltage of the 
excitatory battery. In general, the voltage, V, in different positions of the dendrite 
is described by the cable equation: 
g2v(z,t) 
= + v + + 
d;r 2 
where Ra is the axoplasm resistance per unit length, g. is the resting menbrane 
conductance, and the tilde indicates that in this equation the conductances are 
given per unit length.

For the calculations illustrated in this paper, the stimuli are always delivered to 
the receptive field through two narrow slits. Thus, these stimuli activate synapses 
in two discrete positions ofa dendrite. In this paper, we only show results for square 
wave and sinusoidal modulations of light, however, we also performed calculations 
for more general motions, 
The synaptic sites are small so that their resting conductdices are negligible, 
and we assume that outside these sites the excitatory and inhibitory conductdices 
are zero. In this case, the equation for outside the synapses is:

where /, = ,/A, and where if R0 is the soma's input resistance, then p = 
(the dendritic-to-soma conductance ratio). The first condition means that currents 
do not flow through the tips of the dendrites. 
Finally, label by 1 the synapse proximM to the soma, and by 2 the distal one; 
the boundary conditions at the synapses are

It can be shown that the relative inhibitory strength for motions in the prefeed 
direction decreases with L and increases with p. Thus, to favor conditions for 
multiplicity of direction selectivity in the receptive field, we perform cMculations 
with L   and p = t. The strengths of the excitatoy synapses are set such that 
their contribution to somatic voltage in the absence of inhibition is invariant with 
position. Finally, we ensure that the excitatory synapses never saturate. 
Unde these conditions, one can show that the voltage in the soma is: 
((vi,t + 2) ri,2 + 2vi,1 + 4) e 26 - vi,tvi,2 
where y is the distance between the synapses. 
A final quantity, which is used in this paper is the directional selectivity index 
n. Let v and Un be the total responses to the second slit in the apparent motion 
in the preferred and null directions respectively. (Alternatively, for the sinusoidal

motion, these quantities are the respective average responses.) We follow Grzywacz 
and Koch (1987) and define

It can be shown that the critical parameter controlling whether a certain synap- 
tic distance produces a criterion directional selectivity is 'i (Equation 1). As the 
parameter v i increases, the criterion distance decreases. Thus, since in retinal di- 
rectionaJly selective cells the inhibition has high gain (Arethor and Grzywacz, 1989) 
and the dendrites are fine (Anthor, Oyster and Takahashi, 1984; Arethor, Taka-
