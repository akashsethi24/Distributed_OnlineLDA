Abstract 
We have developed a computational theory of rodent navigation that 
includes analogs of the place cell system, the head direction system, and 
path integration. In this paper we present simulation results showing how 
interactions between the place and head direction systems can account for 
recent observations about hippocampal place cell responses to doubling 
and/or rotation of cue cards in a cylindrical arena (Sharp et al., 1990). 
Rodents have multiple internal representations of their relationship to their environment. 
They have, for example, a representation of their location (place cells in the hippocampal 
formation, see Muller et al., 1991), and a location-independent representation of their 
heading (head direction cells in the postsubiculum and the anterior thalamic nuclei, see 
Taube et al., 1990; Taube, 1995). 
If these representations are to be used for navigation, they must be aligned consistently 
whenever the animal reenters a familiar environment. This process was examined in a set 
of experiments by Sharp et al. (1990). 
1 The Sharp et al., 1990 experiment 
Rats spent multiple sessions finding food scattered randomly on the floor of a black cylin- 
drical arena with a white cue card along the wall subtending 90 � of arc. The animals were 
not disoriented before entering the arena, and they always entered at the same location: the 
northwest corner. See Figure 3a. Hippocampal place fields were mapped by single-cell 
recording. A variety of probe trials were then introduced. When an identical second cue

card was added opposite the first (Figure 3c), most place fields did not double.  Instead, 
the cells continued to fire at their original locations. However, if the rat was introduced into 
the double-card environment at the southeast corner (Figure 3d), the place fields rotated 
by 180 � . But rotation did not occur in single-card probe trials with a southeast entry point 
(Figure 3b). When tested with cue cards rotated by +30 �, Sharp et al. observed that place 
field locations were controlled by an interaction of the choice of entry point with the cue 
card positions (Figure 3f.) 
2 The CRAWL model 
In earlier work (Wan et al., 1994a; Wan et al., 1994b; Redish and Touretzky, 1996) we 
described a model of rodent navigation that includes analogs of both place cells and the head 
direction system. This model also includes a local view module representing egocentric 
spatial information about landmarks, and a separate metric representation of location which 
serves as a substrate for path integration. The existence of a path integration faculty in 
rodents is strongly supported by behavioral data; see Maurer and Seguinot (1995) for 
a discussion. Hypotheses about the underyling neural mechanismss are presently being 
explored by several researchers, including us. 
The structure of our model is shown in Figure 1. Visual inputs are represented as triples of 
form (Ti, ri, Oi), each denoting the type, distance, and egocentric bearing of a landmark. The 
experiments reported here used two point-type landmarks representing the left and right 
edges of the cue card, and one surface-type landmark representing the arena wall. For the 
latter, ri and 0i define the normal vector between the rat and the surface. In the local view 
module, egocentric bearings Oi are converted to allocentric form bi by adding the current 
value represented in the head direction system, denoted as 4ih. The visual angle ctii between 
pairs of landmarks is also part of the local view, and can be used to help localize the animal 
when its head direction is unknown. See Figure 2. 
Five of the 18 cells recorded by Sharp et al. changed their place fields over the various recording 
sessions. Our model does not reproduce these effects, since it does not address changes in place cell 
tuning. Such changes could occur due to variations in the animal's mental state from one trial to the 
next, or as a result of learning across trials.

animal is at path integrator coordinates (xp, yp). 
Our simulated place units are radial basis functions tuned to combinations of individual 
landmark bearings and distances, visual angles between landmark pairs, and path integrator 
coordinates. Place units can be driven by visual input alone when the animal is trying 
to localize itself upon initial entry at a random spot in the environment, or by the path 
integrator alone when navigating in the dark. But normally they are driven by both 
sources simultaneously. A key role of the place system is to maintain associations between 
the two representations, so that either can be reconstructed from the other. The place 
system also maintains a record of allocentric bearings of landmarks when viewed from the 
current position; this enables the local view module to compare perceived with remembered 
landmark bearings, so that drift in the head direction system can be detected and corrected. 
In computer simulations using a single parameter set, the model reproduces a variety 
of behavioral and neurophysiological results including control of place fields by visual 
landmarks, persistence of place fields in the dark, and place fields drifting in synchrony 
with drift in the head direction system. Its predictions for open-field landmark-based 
navigation behavior match many of the experimental results of Collett et al. (1986) for 
gerbils. 
2.1 Entering a familiar environment 
Upon entering a familiar environment, the model's four spatial representations (local view, 
head direction, place code, and path integrator coordinates) must be aligned with the 
current sensory input and with each other. Note that local view information is completely 
determined given the visual input and head direction, and place cell activity is completely 
determined given the local view and path integrator representations. Thus, the alignment 
process manipulates just two variables: head direction and path integrator coordinates. 
When the animal enters the environment with initial estimates for them, the alignment 
process can produce four possible outcomes: (1) Retain the initial values of both variables, 
(2) Reset the head direction, (3) Reset the path integrator, or (4) Reset both head direction 
and the path integraton 
2.2 Prioritizing the outcomes 
When the animal was placed at the northwest entry point and there were two cue cards 
(Figure 3c), we note that the orientation of the wall segment adjacent to the place field 
is identical with that in the training case. This suggests that the animal's head direction 
64 A.D. REDISH, D. S. TOURETZKY 
did not change. The spatial relationship between the entry point and place field was also 
unchanged: notice that the distance from the entry point to the center of the field is the 
same as in Figure 3a. Therefore, we conclude that the initially estimated path integrator 
coordinates were retained. Alternatively, the animal could have changed both its head 
direction (by 180 �) and its path integrator coordinates (to those of the southeast corner) and 
produced consistent results, but to the experimenter the place field would appear to have 
flipped to the other card. Because no flip was observed, the first outcome must have priority 
over the fourth. 
In panel d, where the place field has flipped to the northwest corner, the orientation of the 
segment of wall adjacent to the field has changed, but the spatial relationship between the 
entry point and field center has not. Resetting the path integrator and not the head direction 
would also give a solution consistent with this local view, but with the place field unflipped 
(as in panel b). We conclude that the second outcome (reset head direction) must have 
priority over the third (reset the path integrator). 
The third and fourth outcomes are demonstrated in Figures 3b and 3f. In panel b, the 
orientation of the wall adjacent to the place field is unchanged from panel a, but the spatial 
relationship between the entry point and the place field center is different, as evidenced by 
the fact that the distance between them is much reduced. This is outcome 3. In panel f, 
both variables have changed (outcome 4). 
Finally, the fact that place fields are stable over an entire session, even when there are 
multiple cue cards (and therefore multiple consistent pairings of head directions and path 
integrator coordinates) implies that animals do not reset their head direction or path in- 
tegrator in visually ambiguous environments as long as the current values are reasonably 
consistent with the local view. We therefore assume that outcome 1 is preferred over the 
others. 
This analysis establishes a partial ordering over the four outcomes: 1 is preferred over 4 by 
Figure 3c, and over the others by the stability of place fields, and outcome 2 is preferred 
over 3 by Figure 3d. This leaves open the question of whether outcome 3 or 4 has priority 
over the other. In this experiment, after resetting the path integrator it's always safe for the 
animal to attempt to reset its head direction. If the head direction does not change by more 
than a few degrees, as in panel b, we observe outcome 3; if it does change substantially, as 
in panel f, we observe outcome 4.
