Abstract 
In most neural network models, synapses are treated as static weights that 
change only on the slow time scales of learning. In fact, however, synapses 
are highly dynamic, and show use-dependent plasticity over a wide range 
of time scales. Moreover, synaptic transmission is an inherently stochastic 
process: a spike arriving at a presynaptic terminal triggers release of a 
vesicle of neurotransmitter from a release site with a probability that can 
be much less than one. Changes in release probability represent one of the 
main mechanisms by which synaptic efficacy is modulated in neural circuits. 
We propose and investigate a simple model for dynamic stochastic synapses 
that can easily be integrated into common models for neural computation. 
We show through computer simulations and rigorous theoretical analysis 
that this model for a dynamic stochastic synapse increases computational 
power in a nontrivial way. Our results may have implications for the process- 
ing of time-varying signals by both biological and artificial neural networks. 
A synapse S carries out computations on spike trains, more precisely on trains of spikes 
from the presynaptic neuron. Each spike from the presynaptic neuron may or may not 
trigger the release of a neurotransmitter-filled vesicle at the synapse. The probability of a 
vesicle release ranges from about 0.01 to almost 1. Furthermore this release probability is 
known to be strongly history dependent [Dobrunz and Stevens, 1997]. A spike causes an 
excitatory or inhibitory potential (EPSP or IPSP, respectively) in the postsynaptic neuron 
only when a vesicle is released. 
A spike train is represented as a sequence _t of firing times, i.e. as increasing sequences 
of numbers t < t2 < ... from R + :- (z  R: z _ 0) . For each spike train t the output of 
synapse S consists of the sequence S(t-) of those ti  t_ on which vesicles are released by 
$, i.e. of those t i  t_ which cause an excitatory or inhibitory postsynaptic potential (EPSP 
or IPSP, respectively). The map t_ - S(t_) may be viewed as a stochastic function that is 
computed by synapse S. Alternatively one can characterize the output S(t_) of a synapse 
S through its release pattern q - qq2...  (R, F)* , where R stands for release and F for 
failure of release. For each ti  t_ one sets qi = R if ti  S(_t) , and qi = F if ti  S(_t) .

I Basic model 
The central equation in our dynamic synapse model gives the probability ps(ti) that the i th 
spike in a presynaptic spike train t_ = (t,... ,tk) triggers the release of a vesicle at time ti 
at synapse S, 
ps(ti) = 1 - e -c(t')'v(t') . 
(1) 
The release probability is assumed to be nonzero only for t 6 t, so that releases occur only 
when a spike invades the presynaptic terminal (i.e. the spontaneous release probability is 
assumed to be zero). The functions C(t) > 0 and V(t) > 0 describe, respectively, the states 
of facilitation and depletion at the synapse at time t. 
The dynamics of facilitation are given by 
c(t) = Co + c(t - t,), (2) 
where Co is some parameter >_ 0 that cam for example be related to the resting concentration 
of calcium in the synapse. The exponential response function c(s) models the response of 
C(t) to a presynaptic spike that had reached the synapse at time t - s: c(s) = a. e -8/Tc , 
where the positive parameters re and a give the decay constant and magnitude, respectively, 
of the response. The function C models in an abstract way internal synaptic processes 
underlying presynaptic facilitation, such as the concentration of calcium in the presynaptic 
terminal. The particular exponential form used for c(s) could arise for example if presynaptic 
calcium dynamics were governed by a simple first order process. 
The dynamics of depletion are given by 
u(t) = mx( 0, v0 - v(t - t,)), 
ti: ti<t and tiCS(t_) 
for some parameter V0 > 0. V(t) depends on the subset of those ti 6 _t with ti < t on which 
vesicles were actually released by the synapse, i.e. ti  S(_t). The function v(s) models the 
response of V(t) to a preceding release of the same synapse at time t - s <_ t. Analogously 
as for c(s) one may choose for v(s) a function with exponential decay v(s) = e -8/Tv , 
where rv > 0 is the decay constant. The function V models in an abstract way internal 
synaptic processes that support presynaptic depression, such as depletion of the pool of 
readily releasable vesicles. In a more specific synapse model one could interpret V0 as the 
maximal number of vesicles that can be stored in the readily releasable pool, and V(t) as 
the expected number of vesicles in the rearlily releasable pool at time t. 
In summary, the model of synaptic dynamics presented here is described by five pa- 
rmeters: Co, Vo, re, rv and a. The dynamics of a synaptic computation and its internal 
variables C(I) and V(t) are indicated in Fig. 1. 
For low release probabilities, Eq. 1 can be expanded to first order around r(t) := 
C(t). V(t) = 0 to give 
ps(ti) = C(ti) . V(ti) + O([C(ti) . V(ti)]2).

Similar expressions have been widely used to describe synaptic dynamics for multiple 
synapses [Magleby, 1987, Markram and Tsodyks, 1996, Varela et al., 1997]. 
In our synapse model, we have assumed a standard exponential form for the de- 
cay of facilitation and depression (see e.g. [Magleby, 1987, Markram and Tsodyks, 1996, 
Varela et ai., 1997, Dobrunz and Stevens, 1997]). We have further assumed a multiplica- 
rive interaction between facilitation and depletion. While this form has not been validated

at single synapses, in the limit of low release probability (see Eq. 4), it agrees with the 
multiplicative term employed in [Varela et al., 1997] to describe the dynamics of multiple 
synapses. 
The assumption that release at individual release sites of a synapse is binary, i.e. that 
each release site releases 0 or 1--but not more than 1--vesicle when invaded by a spike, leads 
to the exponential form of Eq. I [Dobrunz and Stevens, 1997]. We emphasize the formal 
distinction between release site and synapse. A synapse might consist of several release sites 
in parallel, each of which has a dynamics similar to that of the stochastic synapse model 
we consider. 
2 Results 
2.1 Different Weights for the First and Second Spike in a Train 
We start by investigating the range of different release probabilities ps(t),ps(t2) that a 
synapse S can assume for the first two spikes in a given spike train. These release probabil- 
ities depend on t2 - tl as well as on the values of the internal parameters Co, V0, -c, -v, a 
of the synapse $. Here we analyze the potential freedom of a synapse to choose values for 
ps(t) and ps(t). We show in Theorem 2.1 that the range of values for the release prob- 
abilities for the first two spikes is quite large, and that the entire attainable range can be 
reached through through suitable choices of Co and V0. 
Theorem 2.1 Let (tl,t) be some arbitrary spike train consisting of two spikes, and let 
p,p 6 (0, 1) be some arbitrary given numbers with p > p � (1 -p). Furthermore assume 
that arbitrary positive values are given for the parameters a, -c, rv of a synapse S. Then one 
can always find values for the two parameters Co and Vo of the synapse $ so that ps(tl ) = p 
and ps(t2) = p. 
Furthermore the condition p > Pl ' (1 - Pl) /S necessary in a strong sense. If p _< 
p � (1 -- p) then no synapse $ can achieve ps(tl) -- Pl and p$(t) = p for any spike train 
(t, t.) and for any values of its parameters Co, Vo, re, v', a. 
If one associates the current sum of release probabilities of multiple synapses or release 
sites between two neurons u and v with the current value of the connection strength w,,v 
between two neurons in a formal neural network model, then the preceding result points

to a significant difference between the dynamics of computations in biological circuits and 
formal neural network models. Whereas in formal neural network models it is commonly 
assumed that the value of a synaptic weight stays fixed during a computation, the release 
probabilities of synapses in biological neural circuits may change on a fast time scale within 
a single computation. 
2.2 Release Patterns for the First Three Spikes 
In this section we examine the variety of release patterns that a synapse can produce for 
spike trains tl,t2,t3,... with at least three spikes. We show not only that a synapse can 
make use of different parameter settings to produce 'different release patterns, but also that 
a synapse with a fixed parameter setting can respond quite differently to spike trains with 
different interspike intervals. Hence a synapse can serve as pattern detector for temporal 
patterns in spike trains. 
It turns out that the structure of the triples of release probabilities
