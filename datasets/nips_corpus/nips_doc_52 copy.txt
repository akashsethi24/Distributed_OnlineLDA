ABSTRACT 
A computer model of the hippocampal pyramidal cell (HPC) is described 
which integrates data from a variety of sources in order to develop a con- 
sistent description for this cell type. The model presently includes descrip- 
tions of eleven non-linear somatic currents of the HPC, and the electrotonic 
structure of the neuron is modelled with a soma/short-cable approximation. 
Model simulations qualitatively or quantitatively reproduce a wide range of 
somatic electrical behavior ii HPCs, and demonstrate possible roles for the 
various currents in information processing. 
1 The Computational Properties of Neurons 
There are several substrates for neuronal computation, including connec- 
tivity, synapses, morphometrics of dendritic trees, linear parameters of cell 
membrane, as well as non-linear, time-varying membrane conductances, also 
referred to as currents or channels. In the classical description of neuronal 
function, the contribution of membrane channels is constrained to that of 
generating the action potential, setting firing threshold, and establishing the 
relationship between (steady-state) stimulus intensity and firing frequency. 
However, it is becoming clear that the role of these channels may be much 
more complex, resulting in a variety of novel computational operators that 
reflect the information processing occurring in the biological neural net.

2 Modelling Hippocampal Neurons 
Over the past decade a wide variety of non-linear ion channels, have been 
described for many excitable cells, in particular several kinds of neurons. 
One such neuron is the hippocampal pyramidal cell (HPC). HPC chan- 
nels are marked by their wide range of temporal, voltage-dependent, and 
chemical-dependent characteristics, which results in very complex behavior 
or responses of these stereotypical cortical integrating cells. For example, 
some HPC channels are activated (opened) transiently and quickly, thus pri- 
marily affecting the action potential shape. Other channels have longer ki- 
netics, modulating the response of HPCs over hundreds of milliseconds. The 
measurement these channels is hampered by various technical constraints, 
including the small size and extended electrotonic structure of HPCs and the 
diverse preparations used in experiments. Modelling the electrical behavior 
of HPCs with computer simulations is one method of integrating data from 
a variety of sources in order to develop a consistent description for this cell 
type. 
In the model referred to here putative mechanisms for voltage-dependent 
and calcium-dependent channel gating have been used to generate simula- 
tions of the somatic electrical behavior of HPCs, and to suggest mechanisms 
for information processing at the single cell level. The model has also been 
used to suggest experimental protocols designed to test the validity of sim- 
ulation results. Model simulations qualitatively or quantitatively reproduce 
a wide range of somatic electrical behavior in HPCs, and explicitly demon- 
strate possible functional roles for the various currents [1]. 
The model presently includes descriptions of eleven non-linear somatic 
currents, including three putative Na + currents - INa-t-ig, INa-rep, and 
INa-t,it; six K + currents that have been reported in the literature - IDa 
(Delayed Rectifier), IA, Ic, 1.4Hp (After-hyperpolarization), IM, and IQ; 
and two Ca 2+ currents, also reported previously - Ic, and 
The electrotonic structure of the HPC is modelled with a soma/short- 
cable approximation, and the dendrites are assumed to be linear. While the 
conditions for reducing the dendritic tree to a single cable are not met for 
HPC (the so-called Rail conditions [3]), the Zi, of the cable is close to that 
of the tree. In addition, although HPC dendrites have non-linear membrane, 
it assumed that as a first approximation the contribution of currents from 
this membrane may be ignored in the somatic response to somatic stimulus. 
Likewise, the model structure assumes that axon-soma current under these 
conditions can be lumped into the soma circuit.

In part this paper will address the following question: if neural nets 
are realizable using elements that have simple integrarive all-or-nothing re- 
sponses, connected to each other with regenerative conductors, then what 
is the function for all the channels observed experimentally in real neurons? 
The results of this HPC model study suggest some purpose for these com- 
plexities, and in this paper we shall investigate some of the possible roles of 
non-linear channels in neuronal information processing. However, given the 
speculative nature of many of the currents that we have presented in the 
model, it is important to view results based on the interaction of the many 
model elements as preliminary.

Defining Neural Information Coding is the First 
Step in Describing Biological Computations 
Determination of computational properties of neurons requires a priori as- 
sumptions as to how information is encoded in neuronal output. The clas- 
sical description assumes that information is encoded as spike frequency. 
However, a single output variable, proportional to firing frequency, ignores 
other potentially information-rich degrees of freedom, including: 
� Relative phase of concurrent inputs. 
� Frequency modulation during single bursts. 
� Cessation of firing due to intrinsic mechanisms. 
� Spike shape. 
Note that these variables apply to patterns of repetitive firing 1. The 
relative phase of different inputs to a single cell is very important at low 
firing rates, but becomes less so as firing frequency approaches the time 
constant of the postsynaptic membrane or some other rate-limiting process 
in the synaptic transduction (e.g. neurotransmitter release or post synap- 
tic channel activation/deactivation kinetics). Frequency modulation during 
bursts/spike trains may be important in the interaction of a given axon's 
output with other inputs at the target neuron. Cessation of firing due to 
mechanisms intrinsic to the cell (as opposed to the end of input) may be

important, for example, in that cell's transmission function. Finally, modu- 
lation of spike shape may have several consequences, which will be discussed 
later. 
4 Physiological Modulation of HPC Currents 
In order for modulation of HPC currents to be considered as potential in- 
formation processing mechanisms in vivo, it is necessary to identify physio- 
logical modulators. For several of the currents described here such factors 
have been identified. For example, there is evidence that IM is inhibited 
by muscarinic (physiologically, cholinergic) agonists [2], that 1,4 is inhib- 
ited by acetylcholine [6], and that 1.4HP is inhibited by noradrenaline [5]. 
In fct, the list of neurotransmitters which are active non-synaptically is 
growing rapidly. It remains to be seen whether there are as yet undiscov- 
ered mechanisms for modulating other HPC currents, for example the three 
Na + currents proposed in the present model. Some possible consequences 
of such mechanisms will be discussed later. 
5 HPC Currents and Information Processing 
The role of a given channel on the HPC electrical response depends on its 
temporal characteristics as a function of voltage, intracellular messengers, 
and other variables. This is complicated by the fact that the opening and 
closing of channels is equivalent to varying conductances, allowing both lin- 
ear and non-linear operations (e.g. [4] and [7]). In particular, a current 
which is activated/deactivated over a period of hundreds of milliseconds 
will, to a first approximation, act by slowly changing the time constant of 
the membrane. At the other extreme, currents which activate/deactivate 
with sub-millisecond time constants act by changing the trajectory of the 
membrane voltage in complicated ways. The classic example of this is the 
role of Na + currents underlying the action potential. 
To investigate how the different HPC currents may contribute to the 
information processing of this neuron, we have looked at how each current 
shapes the HPC response to a simple repertoire of inputs. At this stage 
in our research the inputs have been very basic - short somatic current 
steps that evoke single spikes, long lasting somatic current steps that evoke 
spike trains, and current steps at the distal end of the dendritic cable. By 
examining the response to these inputs the functional roles of the HPC

parentheses indicate secondary role, e.g. Ca 2+ activation of K + current. 
currents can be tentatively grouped into three (non-exclusive) categories: 
� Modulation of spike shape. 
� Modulation of firing threshold, both for single and repetitive spikes. 
� Modulation of semi-steady-state membrane time constant. 
� Modulation of repetitive firing, specifically the relationship between 
strength of tonic input and frequency of initial burst and later steady 
state spike train. 
Table I summarizes speculative roles for some of the HPC currents as 
suggested by the simulations. Note that while all four of the listed char- 
acteristics are interrelated, the last two are particularly so and are lumped
