ABSTRACT 
The interaction of a set of tropisms is sufficient in many 
cases to explain the seemingly complex behavioral responses 
exhibited by varied classes of biological systems to combinations of 
stimuli. It can be shown that a straightforward generalization of 
the tropism phenomenon allows the efficient implementation of 
effective algorithms which appear to respond intelligently to 
changing environmental conditions. Examples of the utilization of 
troplstic processing techniques will be presented in this paper in 
applications entailing simulated behavior synthesis, path-planning, 
pattern analysis (clustering), and engineering design optimization. 
INTRODUCTION 
The goal of this paper is to present an intuitive overview of 
a general unsupervised procedure for addressing a variety of system 
control and cost minimization problems. This procedure is based on 
the idea of utilizing stimuli produced by the environment in which 
the systems are designed to operate as basis for dynamically 
providing the necessary system parameter updates. 
This is by no means a new idea: countless examples of this 
approach abound in nature, where innate reactions to specific 
stimuli (tropisms or taxis --not to be confused with 
instincts) provide organisms with built-in first-order control 
laws for triggering varied responses [8]. (It is hypothesized that 
knowledge obtained through evolution/adaptation or through 
learning then refines or suppresses most of these primal reactions). 
Several examples of the implicit utilization of this approach 
can also be found in the literature, in applications ranging from 
behavior modeling to pattern analysis. We very briefly depict some 
these applications, underlining a common pattern in their 
formulation and generalizing it through the use of basic field 
theory concepts and representations. A more rigorous and detailed 
exposition --regarding both mathematic and 
application/implementation aspects-- is presently under preparation 
and should be ready for publication sometime next year ([6]). 
TROPI SMS 
Tropisms can be defined in general as class-invariant systemic 
responses to specific sets of stimuli [6]. All time-invariant 
systems can thus be viewed as tropistic provided that we allow all 
possible stimuli to form part of our set of inputs. In most 
tropistic systems, however, response- (or time-) invariance applies 
only to specific inputs: green plants, for example, twist and grow 
in the direction of light (phototropism), some birds  flight 
patterns follow changes in the Earth's magnetic field 
(magnetotropism), various organisms react to gravitational field

variations (geotropism), etc. 
Tropism/stimuli interactions can be portrayed in term of the 
superposition of scalar (e.g., potential) or vector (e.g., force) 
fields exhibiting properties paralleling those of the suitably 
constrained reactions we wish to model [1],[6]. The resulting 
field can then be used as a basis for assessing the intrinsic cost 
of pursuing any given path of action, and standard techniques (e.g., 
gradient-following in the case of scalar fields or divergence 
computation in the case of vector fields) utilized in determining a 
response*. In addition, the global view of the situation provided by 
field representations suggest that a basic theory of tropistic 
behavior can also be formulated in terms of energy expenditure 
minimization (Euler-Lagrange equations). This formulation would 
yield integral-based representations (Feynman path integrals 
[4],[11]) satisfying the observation that tropistic processes 
typically obey the principle of least action. 
Alternatively, fields may also be collapsed into attractors 
(points of a given mass or charge in cost space) through laws 
defining the relationships that are to exist among these 
attractors and the other particles traveling through the space. 
This provides the simplification that when updating dynamically 
changing situations only the effects caused by the interaction of 
the attractors with the particles of interest --rather than the 
whole cost field-- may have to be recalculated. 
For example, appropriately positioned point charges exerting 
on each other an electrostatic force inversely proportional to the 
square of their distance can be used to represent the effects of a 
coulombic-type cost potential field. A particle traveling through 
this field would now be affected by the combination of forces 
ensuing from the interaction of the attractors  charges with its 
own. If this particle were then to passively follow the composite of 
the effects of these forces it would be following the gradient of 
the cost field (i.e., the vector resulting from the superposition of 
the forces acting on the particle would point in the direction of 
steepest change in potential). 
Finally, other representations of tropism/stimuli interactions 
(e.g., Value-Driven Decision Theory approaches) entail associating 
profit functions (usually sigmoidal) with each tropism, modeling 
the relative desirability of triggering a reaction as a function of 
the time since it was last activated [9]. These representations are 
* In order to bring extra insight into tropism/stimuli 
interactions and simplify their formulation, one may exchange vector 
and scalar field representations through the utilization of 
appropriately selected mappings. Some of the most important of such 
mappings are the gradient operator (particularly so because the 
gradient of a scalar --potential-- field is proportional to a 
force --vector-- field), the divergence (which may be thought of 
as performing in vector fields a function analogous to that 
performed in scalar fields by the gradient), and their combinations 
(e.g., the Laplacian, a scalar-to-scalar mapping which can be 
visualized as performing on potential fields the equivalent of a 
second derivative operation.

particularly amenable to neural-net implementations [6]. 
TROPISTIC PROCESSING 
Tropistic processing entails building into systems tropisms 
appropriate for the environment in which these systems are expected 
to operate. This allows taking advantage of environment-produced 
stimuli for providing the required control for the systems' 
behavior. 
The idea of tropistic processing has been utilized with good 
results in a variety of applications. Arbib et.al., for example, 
have implicitly utilized tropistic processing to describe a 
batrachian's reaction to its environment in terms of what may be 
visualized as magnetic (vector) fields' interactions [1]. 
Watanabe [12] devised for pattern analysis purposes an 
interaction of tropisms (geotropisms) in which pattern atoms are 
attracted to each other, and hence clustered, subject to a 
squared-inverse-distance (feature distance) law similiar to that 
from gravitational mechanics. It can be seen that if each pattern 
atom were considered an organism, its behavior would not be 
conceptually different from that exhibited by Arbibian frogs: in 
both cases organisms passively follow the force vectors resulting 
from the interaction of the environmental stimuli with the 
organisms' tropisms. It is interesting, though, to note that the 
organisms' behavior will nonetheless appear intelligent to the 
casual observer. 
The ability of tropistic processes to emulate seemingly 
rational behavior is now begining to be explored and utilized in the 
development of synthetic-psychological models and experiments. 
Braitenberg, for example, has placed tropisms as the primal building 
block from which his models for cognition, reason, and emotions 
evolve [3]**; Barto [2] has suggested the possibility of combining 
tropisms and associative (reinforced) learning, with aims at 
enabling the automatic triggering of behavioral responses by 
previously experienced situations; and Fernandez [6] has used 
CROBOTS [10], a virtual multiprocessor emulator, as laboratory for 
evaluating the effects of modifying tropistic responses on the basis 
of their projected future consequences. 
Other applications of tropistic processing presently being 
investigated include path-planning and engineering design 
optimization [6]. For example, consider an air-reconnaissance 
mission deep behind enemy lines; as the mission progresses and 
unexpected SAM sites are discovered, contingency flight paths may be 
developed in real time simply by modeling each SAM or interdiction 
site as a mass point towards which the aircraft exhibits negative 
geotropistic tendencies (i.e., gravitational forces repel it), and 
modeling the objective as a positive geotropistic point. A path to
