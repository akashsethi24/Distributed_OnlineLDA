Abstract 
This paper describes a technique called Input Reconstruction Reliability Estimation 
(IRRE) for determining the response reliability of a restricted class of multi-layer 
percepttons (MLPs). The technique uses a network's ability to accurately encode 
the input pattern in its internal representation as a measure of its reliability. The 
more accurately a network is able to reconstruct the input pattern from its internal 
representation, the more reliable the network is considered to be. IRRE is provides 
a good estimate of the reliability of MLPs trained for autonomous driving. Results 
are presented in which the reliability estimates provided by IRRE are used to select 
between networks trained for different driving situations. 
1 Introduction 
In many real world domains it is important to know the reliability of a network's response 
since a single network cannot be expected to accurately handle all the possible inputs. Ideally, 
a network should not only provide a response to a given input pattern, but also an indication of 
the likelihood that its response is correct. This reliability measure could be used to weight 
the outputs from multiple networks and to determine when a new network needs to be trained. 
This paper describes a technique for estimating a network's reliability called Input Recon- 
struction Reliability Estimation (IRRE). IRRE relies on the fact that the hidden representation 
developed by an artificial neural network can be considered to be a compressed representation 
of important input features. For example, when the network shown in Figure 1 is trained to 
produce the correct steering direction from images of the road ahead, the hidden units learn to 
encode the position and orientation of important features like the road edges and lane markers 
(See [Pomerleau, 1991] for more details). Because there are many fewer hidden units than 
input units in the network, the hidden units cannot accurately represent all the details of an

arbitrary input pattern. Instead, the hidden units learn to devote their limited representational 
capabilities to encoding the position and orientation of consistent, frequently-occurring fea- 
tures from the training set. When presented with an atypical input, such as a road with a 
different number of lanes, the feature detectors developed by the hidden units will not be 
capable of accurately encode all the actual input features. 
Input Reconstruction Reliability Estimation exploits this limitation in representational capacity 
to estimate a network's reliability. In IRRE, the network's internal representation is used to 
reconstruct in the input pattern being presented. The more closely the reconstructed input 
matches the actual input, the more familiar the input and hence the more reliable the network's 
response. 
2 Reconstructing the Input 
IRRE utilized an additional set of output units to perform input reconstruction called the 
encoder output array, as depicted in Figure 2. This second set of output units has the same 
dimensionality as the input retina. In the experiments described in this paper, the input layer 
and encoder output array have 30 rows and 32 columns. The desired activation for each of 
these additional output units is identical to the activation of the corresponding input unit. In 
essence, these additional output units turn the network into an autoencoder. 
The network is trained using backpropagation both to produce the correct steering response 
on the steering output units, and to reconstruct the input image as accurately as possible 
on the encoder output array. During the training process, the network is presented with 
several hundred images taken with a camera onboard our test vehicle as a person drives 
(See [Pomerleau, 1991] for more details). Training typically requires approximately 3 minutes 
during which the person drives over a 1/4 to 1/2 mile stretch of road.

During testing on a new stretch of road, images are presented to the network and activation is 
propagated forward through the network to produce a steering response and a reconstructed 
input image. The reliability of the steering response is estimated by computing the correlation 
coefficient p(I, R) between the activation levels of units in the actual input image I and the 
reconstructed input image R using the following formula: 
p(l ,R) - 
IR -I -R 
where [ and g are the mean activation value of the actual and the reconstructed images, IR is 
the mean of the set formed by the unit-wise product of the two images, and r/and rR represent 
the stana_ard deviations of the activation values of each image. The higher the correlation 
between the two images, the more reliable the network's response is estimated to be. The 
reason correlation is used to measure the degrees of match between the two images is that, 
unlike Euclidean distance, the correlation measure is invariant to differences in the mean 
and variance between the two images. This is important since the mean and variance of the 
input and the reconstructed images can sometimes vary, even when the input image depicts a 
familiar situation. 
3 Results and Applications 
The degree of correlation between the actual and the reconstructed input images is an extremely 
good indicator of network response accuracy in the domain of autonomous driving, as shown 
in Figure 3. It shows a trained network's steering error and reconstruction error as the vehicle 
drives down a quarter mile stretch of road that starts out as a single lane path and eventually 
becomes a two-lane street. The solid line indicates the network's steering error, as measured 
by the difference in turn curvature between the network's steering response and a person's

steering response at that point along the road. The dashed line represents the network's 
reconstruction error, which is defined to be the degree of statical independence between the 
actual and reconstructed images, or 1 - P0, R). 
The two curves are nearly identical, having a correlation coefficient of 0.92. This close match 
between the curves demonstrates that when the network is unable to accurately reconstruct the 
input image, it is also probably suggesting an incorrect steering direction. Visual inspection 
of the actual and reconstructed input images demonstrates that the degree of resemblance 
between them is a good indication of the actual input's familiarity, as shown in Figure 4. It 
depicts the input image, network response, and reconstructed input at the three points along the 
road, labeled A, B and C in Figure 3. When presented with the image at point A, which closely 
resembles patterns from training set, the network's reconstructed image closely resembles the 
actual input, as shown by the close correspondence between the images labeled Input Acts 
and Reconstructed Input in the left column of Figure 4. This close correspondence between 
the input and reconstructed images suggests that the network can reliably steer in this situation. 
It in fact it can steer accurately on this image, as demonstrated by the close match between the 
network's steering response labeled Output Acts and the desired steering response labeled 
Target Acts in the upper left corner of Figure 4. 
When presented with a situation the network did not encounter during training, such as the 
fork image and the two-lane road image shown in the other two columns of Figure 4, the 
reconstructed image bears much less resemblance to the original input. This suggests that the 
network is confused. This confusion results in an incorrect steering response, illustrated in 
the discrepancy between the network's steering response and the target steering response for 
the two atypical images. 
The reliability prediction provided by IRRE has been used to improve the performance of 
the neural network based autonomous driving system in a number of ways. The simplest is
