Abstract 
We study the effect of correlated noise on the accuracy of popu- 
lation coding using a model of a population of neurons that are 
broadly tuned to an angle in two-dimension. The fluctuations in 
he neuronat activity is modeled as a Gaussian noise with pairwise 
correlations which decays exponentially with the difference between 
the preferred orientations of the pair. By calculating the Fisher in- 
formation of the system, we show that in the biologically relevant 
regime of parameters positive correlations decrease the estimation 
capability of the network relative to the uncorrelated population. 
Moreover strong positive correlations result in information capac- 
ity which saturates to a finite value as the number of cells in the 
population grows. In contrast, negative correlations substantially 
increase the information capacity of the neuronal population. 
1 Introduction 
In nany neural systems, information regarding sensory inputs or (intended) motor 
outputs is found to be distributed throughout a localized pool of neurons. It is gener- 
ally believed that one of the main characteristics of the population coding scheme is 
its redundancy in representing information (Paradiso 1988; Snippe and Koenderink 
1992a; Seung and Sompolinsky 1993). Hence the intrinsic neuronal noise, which 
has detrimental impact on the information processing capability, is expected to be 
compensated by increasing the number of neurons in a pool. Although this expec- 
tation is universally true for an ensemble of neurons whose stochastic variabilities 
are statistically independent, a general theory of the efficiency of population coding 
when the neuronal noise is correlated within the population, has been lacking. The 
conventional wisdom has been that the correlated variability limits the information 
processing' capacity of neuronal ensembles (Zohary, Shadlen, and Newsome 1994).

However, detailed studies of simple models of a correlated population that code for 
a single real-valued parameter led to apparently contradicting claims. Snippe and 
Koenderink (Snippe and Koenderink 1992b) conclude that depending on the details 
of the correlations, such as their spatial range, they may either increase or decrease 
the information capacity relative to the uncorrelated one. Recently, Abbott and 
Dayan (Abbott and Dayan 1998) claimed that in many cases correlated noise im- 
proves the accuracy of population code. Furthermore, even when the information 
is decreased it still grows linearly with the size of the population. If true, this con- 
clusion has an important implication on the utility of using a large population to 
improve the estimation accuracy. Since cross-correlations in neuronal activity are 
frequently observed in both primary sensory and motor areas (Fetz, Yoyama, and 
Snith 1991; Lee, Port, Kruse, and Georgopoulos 1998), understanding the effect of 
noise correlation in biologically relevant situations is of great importance. 
In this paper we present an analytical study of the effect of noise correlations on the 
population coding of a pool of cells that code for a single one-dimensional variable, 
an angle on a plane, e.#., an orientation of a visual stimulus, or the direction of 
an arm movement. By assuming that the noise follows the multivariate Gaussian 
distribution, we investigate analytically the effect of correlation on the Fisher in- 
formation. This model is similar to that considered in (Snippe and Koenderink 
1992b; Abbott and Dayan 1998). By analyzing its behavior in the biologically rel- 
evant regime of tuning width and correlation range, we derive general conclusions 
about the effect of the correlations on the information capacity of the population. 
2 Population Coding with Correlated Noise 
We consider a population of N neurons which respond to a stimulus characterized 
by an angle 0, where -r < 0 _< r. The activity of each neuron (indexed by i) is 
assumed to be Gaussian with a mean fi(O) which represents its tuning curve, and a 
uniform variance a. The noise is assumed to be pairwise-correlated throughout the 
population. Hence the activity profile of the whole population, R = {rl, r2,' � �, rN }, 
given a stimulus 0, follows the following multivariate Gaussian distribution. 
P(R[O) = A/' exp 
(1 )

i,j 
(1) 
where A/is a normalization constant and Cij is the correlation matrix. 
Cij = aSij + bij (1 - 5ij). 
(2) 
It is assumed that the tuning curves of all the neurons are identical in form but 
peaked at different angles, that is fi(O) = f(O - Oi) where the preferred angles 
are distributed uniformly from -r to r with a lattice spacing, w, which is equal 
to 2r/N. We further assume that the noise correlation between a pair of neurons 
is only a function of their preferred angle difference, i.e., bij(O) = 
where ]101 - 021] is defined to be the relative angle between 01 and 02, and hence 
its maximum value is r. A decrease in the magnitude of neuronal correlations with 
the dissimilarity in the preferred stimulus is often observed in cortical areas. We 
model this by exponentially decaying correlations 
bij = b exp( IlOi - O2[[ ) (3) 
P 
where p specifies the angular correlation length. 
Fisher Information of Correlated Population Codes 169 
The amount of information that can be extracted from the above population will 
depend on tile decoding scheme. A convenient measure of the information capacity 
in the population is given by the Fisher inibrmation, which in our case is (ibr a 
given stimulus 0) 
J(0) = s,c59. (4) 
J 
i,j 
where 
9i(0) -= 00 (5) 
The utility of this measure follows from the well known Cramr-Rao bound for the 
variance of any unbiased estimators, i.e., ((0 - t) 2) _> l/J(0). For the rest of this 
pat)er, we will concentrate on the Fishel' information as a function of the noise 
correlation parameters, b and p, as well as the population size N.

To evaluate the effect of correlations in a large population it is inportant to specify 
the appropriate scales of the system parameters. We consider here the biologically 
relevant case of broadly tuned neurons that have a smoothly varying tuning curve 
with a single peak. When the tuning cu,'ve is smoothly varying, t9,I 2 will be 
rapidly decaying function as n increases beyond a characteristic value which is 
170 H. Yoon and H. Sompolinsky 
proportional to the inverse of the tuning width, or. We further assume a broa(t 
tuning, namely that the tuning curve spans a substantial fraction of the angular 
extent. This is consistent with the observed typical values of half-width at half 
height in visual and motor areas, which range from 20 to 60 degrees. Likewise, it 
is reasonable to assume that the angular correlation length p spans a substantial 
fraction of the entire angular range. This broad tuning of correlations with respect 
to the difference in the preferred angles is commonly observed in cortex (Fetz, 
Yoyama, and Smith 1991; Lee, Port, Kruse, and Georgopoulos 1998). To capture 
these features we will consider the limit of large N while keeping the parameters p 
and a constant. Note that keeping a of order 1 implies that substantial contributions 
to Eq. (8) come only from n which remain of order 1 as N increases. On the 
other hand, given the enormous variability in the strength of the observed cross- 
correlations between pairs of neurons in cortex, we do not restrict the value of b at 
this point. 
Incorporating the above scaling we find that when N is large J is given by 
= + 
(  )(1- (-1)e-/P) (11) 
Inspection of the denominator in the above equation clearly shows that for all 
positive values of b, J is smaller than Jo. On the other hand, when b is negative 
J is larger than Jo. To estimate the magnitude of these effects we consider below

Strong positive correlations: We first discuss the regime of strong positive 
correlations, by which we mean that 0 < b/a ,,- (3(1). In this case the second terIn

This result implies that in this regime the Fisher information in the entire popu- 
lation does not scale linearly with the population size N but saturates to a size- 
independent finite limit. Thus, for these strong correlations, although the number 
of neurons in the population may be large, the number of independent degrees of 
freedom is small. 
We demonstrate the above phenomenon by a numerical evaluation of J for the 
following choice of tuning curve 
f(O) = fmax exp ((cos
