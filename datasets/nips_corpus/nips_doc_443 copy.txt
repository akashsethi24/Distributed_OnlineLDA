Abstract 
We use constrained optimization to select operating parameters for two 
circuits: a simple 3-transistor square root circuit, and an analog VLSI 
artificial cochlea. This automated method uses computer controlled mea- 
surement and test equipment to choose chip parameters which minimize 
the difference between the actual circuit's behavior and a specified goal 
behavior. Choosing the proper circuit parameters is important to com- 
pensate for manufacturing deviations or adjust circuit performance within 
a certain range. As biologically-motivated analog VLSI circuits become 
increasingly complex, implying more parameters, setting these parameters 
by hand will become more cumbersome. Thus an automated parameter 
setting method can be of great value [Fleischer 90]. Automated parameter 
setting is an integral part of a goal-based engineering design methodology 
in which circuits are constructed with parameters enabling a wide range 
of behaviors, and are then tuned to the desired behaviors automatically. 
I Introduction 
Constrained optimization methods are useful for setting the parameters of analog 
circuits. We present two experiments in which an automated method successfully 
finds parameter settings which cause our circuit's behavior to closely approximate 
the desired behavior. These parameter-setting experiments are described in Sec- 
tion 3. The difficult subproblems encountered were (1) building the electronic setup

to acquire the data and control the circuit, and (2) specifying the computation of de- 
viation from desired behavior in a mathematical form suitable for the optimization 
tools. We describe the necessary components of the electronic setup in Section 2, 
and we discuss the selection of optimization technique toward the end of Section 3. 
Automated parameter setting can be an important component of a system to build 
accurate analog circuits. The power of this method is enhanced by including appro- 
priate parameters in the initial design of a circuit: we can build circuits with a wide 
range of behaviors and then tune them to the desired behavior. In Section 6, we 
describe a comprehensive design methodology which embodies this strategy. 
2 Implementation 
We have assembled a system which allows us to test these ideas. The system can 
be conceptually decomposed into four distinct parts: 
circuit: an analog VLSI chip intended to compute a particular function. 
target function: a computational model quantitatively describing the desired be- 
havior of the circuit. This model may have the same parameters as the circuit, 
or may be expressed in terms of biological data that the circuit is to mimic. 
error metric: compares the target to the actual circuit function, and computes a 
difference measure. 
constrained optimization tool: a numerical analysis tool, chosen based on the 
characteristics of the particular problem posed by this circuit.

The constrained optimization tool uses the error metric to compute the difference 
between the performance of the circuit and the target function. It then adjusts 
the parameters to minimize the error metric, causing the actual circuit behavior to 
approach the target function as closely as possible. 
2.1 A Generic Physical Setup for Optimization 
A typical physical setup for choosing chip parameters under computer control has 
the following elements: an analog VLSI circuit, a digital computer to control the 
optimization process, computer programmable voltage/current sources to drive the 
chip, and computer programmable measurement devices, such as electrometers and 
oscilloscopes, to measure the chip's response. 
The combination of all of these elements provides a self-contained environment for 
testing chips. The setting of parameters can then be performed at whatever level

of automation is desirable. In this way, all inputs to the chip and all measurements 
of the outputs can be controlled by the computer. 
3 The Experiments 
We perform two experiments to set parameters of analog VLSI circuits using con- 
strained optimization. The first experiment is a simple one-parameter system, a 
3-transistor square root circuit. The second experiment uses a more complex 
time-varying multi-parameter system, an analog VLSI electronic cochlea. The ar- 
tificial cochlea is composed of cascaded 2nd order section filters. 
3.1 Square Root Experiment 
In the first experiment we examine a square-root circuit [Mead 89], which actually 
computes ax ' + b, where ( is typically near 0.4. We introduce a parameter (V) into 
this circuit which varies a indirectly. By adjusting the voltage V in the square root 
circuit, as shown in Figure l(a), we can alter the shape of the response curve.

We have little control over the values of a and b in this circuit, so we choose an 
error metric which optimizes a, targeting a curve which has a slope of 0.5 in log-log 
Ii, vs. Io,t space. Since b << av , we can safely ignore b for the purposes of this 
parameter-setting experiment. The entire optimization process takes only a few 
minutes for this simple one-parameter system. Figure l(b) shows the final results 
of the square root computation, with the circuit output normalized by a and b. 
3.2 Analog VLSI Cochlea 
As an example of a more complex system on which to test the constrained optimiza- 
tion technique, we chose a silicon cochlea, as described by [Lyon 88]. The silicon 
cochlea is a cascade of lowpass second-order filter sections arranged such that the 
natural frequency v of the stages decreases exponentially with distance into the 
792 Kirk, Fleischer, Watts, and Barr 
cascade, while the quality factor Q of the filters is the same for each section (tap). 
The value of Q determines the peak gain at each tap.

Figure 2: Cochlea circuit 
To specify the performance of such a cochlea, we need to specify the natural frequen- 
cies of the first and last taps, and the peak gain at each tap. These performance 
parameters are controlled by bias voltages V L Vn, and VQ, respectively. The 
parameter-setting problem for this circuit is to find the bias voltages that give the 
desired performance. This optimization task is more lengthy than the square root 
optimization. Each measurement of the frequency response takes a few minutes, 
since it is composed of many individual instrument readings. 
3.2.1 Cochlea Results 
The results of our attempts to set parameters for the analog VLSI cochlea are quite 
encouraging.

Figure 4: Target frequency response and gradient descent optimized data for cochlea 
Figure 4 shows both the target frequency response data and the frequency responses 
which result from our chosen parameter settings. The curves are quite similar, and 
the differences are at the scale of measurement noise and instrument resolution in 
our system. 
3.2.2 Cochlea Optimization Strategies 
We explored several optimization strategies for finding the best parameters for the 
electronic cochlea. Of these, two are of particular interest: 
special knowledge: use a priori knowledge of the effect of each knob to guide the 
optimization 
gradient descent: assume that we know nothing except the input/output relation 
of the chip. Then we can estimate the gradient for gradient descent by varying 
the inputs. Robust numerical techniques such as conjugate gradient can also 
be helpful when the energy landscape is steep. 
We found the gradient descent technique to be reliable, although it did not converge 
nearly as quickly as the special knowledge optimization. This corresponds with 
our intuition that any special knowledge we have about the circuit's operation will 
aid us in setting the parameters. 
4 Choosing An Appropriate Optimization Method 
One element of our system which has worked without much difficulty is the optimiza- 
tion. However, more complex circuits may require more sophisticated optimization 
methods. A wide variety of constrained optimization algorithms exist which are
