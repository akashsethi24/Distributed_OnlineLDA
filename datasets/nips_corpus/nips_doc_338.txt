Abstract 
We describe a computational model of the development and regenera- 
tion of specific eye-brain circuits. The model comprises a self-organiz- 
ing map-forming network which uses local Hebb rules, constrained by 
(genetically determined) molecular markers. Various simulations of 
the development and regeneration of eye-brain maps in fish and frogs 
are described, in particular successful simulations of experiments by 
Schmidt-Cicerone-Easter; Meyer; and Yoon. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
In a previous paper published in last years proceedings (Cowan & Friedman 1990) we 
outlined a new computational model for the development and regeneration of eye-brain 
maps. We indicated that such a model can simulate the results of a number of the more 
complicated surgical manipulations carried out on the visual pathways of goldfish and 
frogs. In this paper we describe in more detail some of these experiments, and our 
simulations of them. 
1.1 EYE-BRAIN MAPS 
We refer to figure 1 from the previous paper which shows the retinal map found in the 
optic lobe or rectum of a fish or frog. The map is topological, i.e.; neighborhood

relationships in the retina are preserved in the optic tectum. As is well-known nearly 50 
years ago Sperry (1944) showed that such maps are quite precise and specific, in that 
maps (following optic nerve sectioning and eye rotation) regenerate in such a way that 
optic nerve fibers reconnect, more or less, to their previous rectal sites. Some 20 years 
ago Gaze and Sharma (1970) and Yoon (1972) found evidence for plasticity in the 
expanded and compressed maps which regenerate following eye and brain lesions in 
goldfish. There are now many experiments which indicate that the regeneration of 
connections involves both specificity and plasticity. 
1. 2. EXPANDED MAPS 
Such properties are seen in a series of more complicated experiments involving the 
expansion of a half-eye map to a whole rectum. These experiments were carried out by 
Schmidt, Cicerone and Easter (1978) on goldfish, in which following the expansion of 
retinal fibers from a half-eye over an entire (contralateral) rectum, and subsequent 
sectioning of the fibers, diverted retinal fibers from the other (intact) eye are found to 
expand over the rectum, as if they were also from a half-eye. This has been interpreted to 
imply that the rectum has no intrinsic positional markers to provide cues for incoming 
fibers, and that all its subsequent markers come from the retina (Chung & Cooke, 1978). 
However Schmidt et.al. also found that the diverted fibers also map normally. Figure 4 
of the previous paper shows the result. 
1. 3. COMPRESSED MAPS 
Compression is found in maps from entire eyes to ablated half recta (Gaze & Sharma, 
1970; Sharma & Gaze, 1971; Yoon, 1972). There has been considerable controversy 
concerning the results. Recently Meyer (1982) has shown that although 
electrophysiological techniques seem to provide evidence for smoothly expanded and 
compressed maps, autoradiographic techniques do not. Instead of a smooth map there 
are patches, and in many cases no real expansion or compression is seen in irradiated 
sections, at least not initially. An experiment by Yoon (1976) is relevant here. Yoon 
noticed that in the early stages of map formation under such conditions, the map is 
normal. Only after some considerable time does a compressed map form. However if 
the fibers are sectioned (cut) and allowed to regenerate a second time, compression is 
immediate. This result has been challenged (Cook, 1979), but it was subsequently 
confirmed by Schmidt (1983). 
1. 4. MISMATCHED MAPS 
In mismatch experiments, a half retina is confronted with an inappropriate half tectum. In 
Yoon's classic mismatch experiment (Yoon, 1972) fibers from a half-eye fragment are 
confronted with the wrong half-rectum: the resulting map is normally oriented, even 
though this involves displacement of retinal fibers from near the rectal positions they 
normally would occupy. 
Studies of a Model for the Development and Regeneration of Eye-Brain Maps 5 
About 12 years ago Meyer (1979) carried out another important mismatch experiment in 
which the left half of an eye and its attached retinal fibers were surgically removed, 
leaving an intact normal half-eye map. At the same time the right half the other eye and 
its attached fibers were removed, and the fibers from the remaining half eye were 
allowed to innervate the rectum with the left-half eye map. The result is shown in figure 
5 of our previous paper. Fibers from the right half-retina, labelled 1 through 5, would 
normally make contact with the corresponding tectal neurons. Instead they make contact 
with neurons 6 through 10, but in a reversed orientation. Meyer interprets this result to 
mean that optic nerve fibers show a tendency to aggregate with their nearest retinal 
neighbors. 
2 THE MODEL 
We introduced our model in last year's NIPS proceedings (Cowan & Friedman 1990). We 
here repeat some of the details. Let sij be the strength or weight of the synapse made by 
the ith retinal fiber with the jth rectal cell. Then the following system of differential 
equations expresses the changes in sij: 
ij = Xj + cij [J. lij + (r i - ot)tj] sij 
-  sij (T'li + R-Ij){X j + cij [Slij + (ri - o0tj] sij } (1) 
where i = 1, 2, .... , N r, the number of retinal ganglion cells and j = 1, 2, .... , N t, the 
number of tectal neurons, cij is the stickiness of the ijth contact, r i denotes retinal 
activity and tj = I;isijr i is the corresponding tectal activity, and o is a constant measuring 
the rate of receptor alestabilization (see Whitelaw & Cowan (1981) for details). In 
addition both retinal and tectal elements have fixed lateral inhibitory contacts. The 
dynamics described by eqn. 1 is such that both I;isij and I;jsij tend to constant values T 
and R respectively, where T is the total amount of tectal receptor material available per 
neuron, and R is the total amount of axonal material available per retinal ganglion cell: 
thus if sij increases anywhere in the net, other synapses made by the ith fiber will 
decrease, as will other synapses on the jth tectal neuron. In the current terminology, this 
process is referred to as winner-take-all. 
In addiiton Xj represents a general nonspecific growth of retinotectal contacts, presumed 
to be controlled and modulated by nerve growth factor (Campenot, 1982). Recent 
observations (Davies et. al., 1987) indicate that the first fibers to reach a given target 
neuron stimulate it to produce NGF, which in turn causes more fiber growth. We 
therefore set Xj = T-l_isijX where X is a constant. _isij is the instantaneous value of 
receptor material used to make contacts, and T is the total amount available, so Xj --> X 
as the jth neuron becomes innervated. The coefficient ij represents a postulated random 
depolarization which occurs at synapses due to the quantal release of neurotransmitter-- 
the analog of end-plate potentials (Walmsley et.al., 1987). Thus even if r i = 0, map 
formation can still occur. However the resulting maps are not as sharp as those formed in 
6 Cowan and Friedman 
the presence of retinal activity. Of course if ij = 0, as might be the case if o- 
bungarotoxin is administered, then ij = Xj(1- sij ) and sij --> 1, i.e.; all synapses of 
equal strength. 
It is the coefficients cij. which determine the nature of the solution to eqn. 1. These 
coefficients express the contact adhesion strengths of synapses. We suppose that such 
adhesions are generated by fixed distributions of molecules embedded in neural surface 
membranes. We postulate that the tips of retinal axons and the surfaces of tectal cells 
display at least two molecular species, labelled a and b, such that cij = .abaibj and the 
sum is over all possible combinations aa, ab etc. A number of possibilities exist in the 
choice of tab and of the spatial distribution of a and b. One possibility that is consistent 
with most of the assays which have been carded out (Trisler & Collins (1987), 
Bonhoffer and Huff (1980), Halfter, Claviez & Schwarz (1981), Boenhoffer & Huff 
(1985)) is aa = Ebb > 0 > tab = ba in which each species prefers itself and repels the 
other, the so-called homophilic case, with ai and bi as shown in figure 1.

exist in the tectum. 
The mismatch and compound eye experiments indicate that map formation depends in 
part on a tendency for fibers tO stick to their retinal neighbors, in addition to their 
tendency to stick to tectal cell surfaces. We therefore append to cij the term 'k ï¿½kj fik 
where -kj is a local average of Ski and its nearest rectal neighbors, where fik measures 
themutual stickiness of the ith and kth retinal fibers, and where -'k means -k  i- Fig. 2 
shows the postulated form of fik. {Again we suppose this stickiness is produced by the 
interaction of two molecular species etc.; specifically theneural contact adhesion 
molecules (nCAM) of the sort discovered by Edelman (1983)which seem to mediate the 
fiber-fiber adhesion observed in tissue cultures by Boenhoffer & Huff (1985), but we do 
not go into the details}.

other fibers, especially inappropriate ones, from innervating occupied areas. One way to
