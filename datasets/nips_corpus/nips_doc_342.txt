Abstract 
In response to a puff of wind, the American cockroach turns away and runs. 
The circuit underlying the initial turn of this escape response consists of 
three populations of individually identifiable nerve cells and appears to em- 
ploy distributed representations in its operation. We have reconstructed 
several neuronal and behavioral properties of this system using simplified 
neural network models and the backpropagation learning algorithm con- 
strained by known structural characteristics of the circuitry. In order to 
test and refine the model, we have also compared the model's responses to 
various lesions with the insect's responses to similar lesions. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
It is becoming generally accepted that many behavioral and cognitive capabilities 
of the human brain must be understood as resulting from the cooperative activity 
of populations of nerve cells rather than the individual activity of any particu- 
lar cell. For example, distributed representation of orientation by populations of 
directionally-tuned neurons appears to be a common principle of many mammalian 
motor control systems (Georgopoulos et al., 1988; Lee et al., 1988). While the gen- 
eral principles of distributed processing are evident in these mammalian systems, 
however, the details of their operation are not. Without a deeper knowledge of the 
underlying neuronal circuitry and its inputs and outputs, it is difficult to answer 
such questions as how the population code is formed, how it is read out, and what 
precise role it plays in the operation of the nervous system as a whole. In this paper, 
we describe our work with an invertebrate system, the cockroach escape response, 
which offers the possibility of addressing these questions.

2 THE COCKROACH ESCAPE RESPONSE 
Any sudden puff of wind directed toward the American cockroach (Periplaneta 
americana), such as from an attacking predator, evokes a rapid directional turn 
away from the wind source followed by a run (Ritzmann, 1984). The initial turn is 
generally completed in approximately 60 msec after the onset of the wind. During 
this time, the insect must integrate information from hundreds of sensors to direct 
a very specific set of leg movements involving dozens of muscles distributed among 
three distinct pairs of multisegmented legs. In addition, the response is known to 
exhibit various forms of plasticity, including adaptation to sensory lesions. This 
system has also recently been shown to be capable of multiphasic responses (e.g. an 
attack from the front may elicit a sequence of escape movements rather than a single 
turn) and context-dependent responses (e.g. if the cockroach is in antennal contact 
with an obstacle, it may modify its escape movements accordingly) (Ritzmann et 
al., in preparation). 
The basic architecture of the neuronal circuitry responsible for the initial turn of 
the escape response is known (Daley and Camhi, 1988; Ritzmann and Pollack, 
1988; Ritzmann and Pollack, 1990). Characteristics of the initiating wind puff 
are encoded by a population of several hundred broadly-tuned wind-sensitive hairs 
located on the bottom of the insect's cerci (two antennae-like structures found at the 
rear of the animal). The sensory neurons which innervate these hairs project to a 
small population of four pairs of ventral giant interneurons (the vGIs). These giant 
interneurons excite a larger population of approximately 100 interneurons located 
in the thoracic ganglia associated with each pair of legs. These type A thoracic 
interneurons (the TIAs) integrate information from a variety of other sources as 
well, including leg proprioceptors. Finally, the TIAs project to local interneurons 
and motor neurons responsible for the control of each leg. 
Perhaps what is most interesting about this system is that, despite the complexity 
of the response it controls, and despite the fact that its operation appears to be 
distributed across several populations of interneurons, the individual members of 
these populations are uniquely identifiable. For this reason, we believe that the 
cockroach escape response is an excellent model system for exploring the neuronal 
basis of distributed sensorimotor control at the level of identified nerve cells. As an 
integral part of that effort, we are constructing a computer model of the cockroach 
escape response. 
3 NEURAL NETWORK MODEL 
While a great deal is known about the overall response properties of many of the 
individual neurons in the escape circuit, as well as their architecture of connectiv- 
ity, little detailed biophysical data is currently available. For this reason, our initial 
models have employed simplified neural network models and learning techniques. 
This approach has proven to be effective for analyzing a variety of neuronal cir- 
cuits (e.g. Lockery et al., 1989; Anastasio and Robinson, 1989). Specifically, using 
backpropagation, we train model neurons to reproduce the observed properties of 
identified nerve cells in the escape circuit. 
In order to ensure that the resulting models are biologically relevant, we constrain

backpropagation to produce solutions which are consistent with the known struc- 
tural characteristics of the circuit. The most important constraints we have utilized 
to date are the existence or nonexistence of specific connections between identified 
cells and the signs of existing connections. Other constraints that we are exploring 
include the firing curves and physiological operating ranges of identified neurons in 
the circuit. It is important to emphasize that we employed backpropagation solely 
as a means for finding the appropriate connection weights given the known structure 
of the circuit, and no claim is being made about its biological validity. 
As an example of this approach, we have reconstructed the observed windfields of 
the eight ventral giant interneurons which serve as the first stage of interneuronal 
processing in the escape circuit. These windfields, which represent the intensity of a 
cell's response to wind puffs from different directions, have been well characterized 
in the insect (Westin, Langberg, and Camhi, 1977). The windfields of individual 
cercal sensory neurons have also been mapped (Westin, 1979; Daley and Camhi, 
1988). The response of each hair is broadly tuned about a single preferred direction, 
which we have modeled as a cardioid. The cercal hairs are arranged in nine major 
columns on each cercus. All of the hairs in a single column share similar responses. 
Together, the responses of the hairs in all eighteen columns provide overlapping 
coverage of most directions around the insect's body. The connectivity between 
each major cercal hair column and each ventral giant interneuron is known, as are 
the signs of these connections (Daley and Camhi, 1988). Using these data, each 
model vGI was trained to reproduce the corresponding windfield by constrained 
backpropagation. x The resulting responses of the left four model vGIs are shown 
in Figure 1. These model windfields closely approximate those observed in the 
cockroach. Further details concerning vGI windfield reconstruction will be given in 
a forthcoming paper. 
4 ESCAPE TURN RECONSTRUCTIONS 
Ultimately, we are interested in simulating the entire escape response. This re- 
quires some way to connect our neural models to behavior, an approach that we 
have termed computational neuroethology (Beer, 1990). Toward that end, we have

gation is not needed for this task since we are training only a single layer of weights.

also constructed a three dimensional kinematic model of the insect's body which ac- 
curately represents the essential degrees of freedom of the legs during escape turns. 
For our purposes here, the essential joints are the coxal-femur (CF) and femur-tibia 
(FT) joints of each leg. The leg segment lengths and orientations, as well as the 
joint angles and axes of rotation, were derived from actual measurements (Nye and 
Ritzmann, unpublished data). The active leg movements during escape turns of a 
tethered insect, in which the animal is suspended by a rod above a greased plate, 
have been shown to be identical to those of a free ranging animal (Camhi and Levy, 
1988). Because an insect thus tethered is neither supporting its own weight nor gen- 
erating appreciable forces with its legs, a kinematic body model can be defended as 
an adequate first approximation. 
The leg movements of the simulated body were controlled by a neural network 
model of the entire escape circuit. Where sufficient data was available, the structure 
of this network was constrained appropriately. The first layer of this circuit was 
described in the previous section and is prevented from further training here. There 
are six groups of six representative TIAs, one group for each leg. Within a group, 
representative members of each identified class of TIA are modeled. Where known, 
the connectivity from the vGIs to each class of TIAs was enforced and all connections 
from vGIs to TIAs were constrained to be excitatory (Ritzmann and Pollack, 1988). 
Model TIAs also receive inputs from leg proprioceptors which encode the angle of 
each joint (Murrain and Ritzmann, 1988). The TIA layer for each side of the body
