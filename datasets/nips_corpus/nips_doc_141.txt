ABSTRACT 
We discuss synthetic receptors for haptic sensing. These are based on 
magnetic field sensors (Hall effect structures) fabricated using standard 
CMOS technologies. These receptors, biased with a small permanent 
magnet can detect the presence of ferro or ferri-magnefic objects in the 
vicinity of the sensor. They can also detect the magnitude and direction 
of the magnetic field. 
INTRODUCTION 
The organizational structure and functioning of the sensory periphery in living beings has 
always been the subject of extensive research. Studies of the retina and the cochlea have 
revealed a great deal of information as to the ways information is acquired and 
preprocessed; see for example review chapters in [Barlow and Mollon, 1982]. 
Understanding of the principles underlying the operation of sensory channels can be 
utilized to develop machines that can sense their environment and function in it, much 
like living beings. Although vision is the principal sensory channel to the outside world, 
the skin senses can in some cases provide information that is not available through 
vision. It is interesting to note, that the performance in identifying objects through the 
haptic senses can be comparable to vision [Klatzky eL al, 1985]; longer learning periods 
may be necessary though. Tactually guided exploration and shape perception for robotic 
applications has been extensively investigated by [Hemami et. al, 1988]. 
A number of synthetic sensory systems for vision and audition based on physiological 
models for the retina and the cochlea have been prototyped by Mead and his coworkers in 
VLSI [Mead, 1989]. The key to success in such endeavors is the ability to integrate 
transducers (such as light sensitive devices) and local processing electronics on the same 
chip. A technology that offers that possibility is silicon CMOS; furthermore, it is 
readily available to engineers and scientists through the MOSIS fabrication 
services[Cohen and Lewicki, 1981]. 
Receptor cells, are structures in the sensory pathways whose purpose is to convert 
environmental signals into electrical activity (strictly speaking this is true for

skin deformation. Tactile refers to the perceptual system that includes only the 
cutaneous senses of vibration and deformation.

exteroceptors). The retina rods and cones are examples of receptors for light stimuli and 
the Pacinian corpuscles are mechanoreceptors that are sensitive to indentation or pressure 
on the skin, A synthetic receptor is thus the first and necessary functional element in any 
synthetic sensory system. For the development of vision systems parasitic bipolar devices 
can be used [Mead, 1985] to perform the necessary light to electrical signal transduction 
as well as low level signal amplification. On the other hand, implementation of synthetic 
receptors for tactile perception is still problematic [Barth et. al., 1986]. Truly tactile 
transducers (devices sensitive to pressure stimuli) are not available in standard CMOS 
processes and are only found in specialized fabrication lines. However, devices that are 
sensitive to magnetic fields can be used to some extend as a substitute. 
In this paper, we discuss the development of electronic receptor elements that can be used 
in synthetic haptic/tactile sensing systems. Our receptors are devices which are sensitive 
to steady state or varying magnetic fields and give electrical signals proportional to the 
magnetic induction. They can all be fabricated using standard silicon processes such as 
those offered by MOSIS. We show how our elements can be used for tactile and haptic 
sensing and compare its characteristics with the features of biological receptors. The 
spatial resolution of the devices, its frequency response and dynamic range are more than 
adequate. One of our devices has nano-watt power dissipation and thus can be used in large 
arrays for high resolution sensing. 
THE MAGNETIC-FIELD SENSORY PARADIGM 
In this section we show qualitatively how to implement synthetic sensory functions of 
the haptic and tactile senses by using magnetic fields and theft interaction with ferri or 
ferro-magnetic objects. This will motivate the more detailed discussion that follows on 
the transducer devices. 
DIRECT SENSING: 
In this mode of operation the transducer will detect the magnitude and direction of the 
magnetic induction and convert it into an electrical signal. If the magnetic field is 
provided by the fringing fields of a small permanent magnet, the strength of the signal 
will fall off with the distance of the sensor from the magnet. Such an arrangement for one 
dimensional sensing is shown in Figure 1. The experimental data are from the MOS 
Hall-voltage generator that is described in the next section. The magnetic field was 
provided by a cylindrical, rare-earth, permanent magnet with magnetic induction 
Bo=250mT, measured on the end surfaces.The vertical axis shows the signal from the 
transducer (Hall-voltage) and the horizontal axis represents the distance d of the sensor 
from the surface of the magnet. 
The above scheme can be used to sense the angular displacement between two fingers at a 
joint (inset b). By placing a small magnet on one side of the joint and the receptor on the 
other, the signal from the receptor can be conditioned and converted into a measure of the 
angle O between the two fingers. The output of our receptor would thus correspond to the 
output from the Joint Fibers that originate in the Joint Capsule [Johnson, 1981]. Joint 
angle perception and manual stereognosis is mediated in part by these fibers. The above is 
just one example of how to use our integrated electronic receptor element for sensing

skeletal conformation and position. Since there is no moving parts other than the joint 
itself, this is a reliable scheme.

PASSIVE SENSING 
In this mode of operation, the device or an array of devices are permanently biased with a 
uniform magnetic field whose uniformity can be disturbed in the presence of a ferro or 
ferri-magnefic object in the vicinity. Signals from an array of such elements would 
provide ifnormation on the shape of the object that causes the disturbance of the magnetic 
field. Non-magnetic objects can be sensed if the surface of the chip is covered with a 
compliant membrane that has some magnetic properties. Note that our receptors can 
detect the presence of an object without having a direct contact with the object itself. 
This may in some cases be advantageous. 
In this application, the magnetic field sensor would act more like the Ruffini organs 
which exist in the deeper tissue and are primarily sensitive to static skin stretch. The 
above scheme could also be used for sensing dynamic. stimuli and there is a variety of 
receptor cells, such as the Pacinian and Meissner's corpuscles that perform that function 
in biological tactile senses [Johnson, 1981].

SILICON TRANSDUCERS 
Magnetic field sensors can be integrated on silicon in a variety of forms. The transduction 
mechanism is due to some gaivanomagnetic effect; the Hall effect or some related 
phenomenon [Andreou, 1986]. For an up-todate review of integrated magnetic field 
sensors as well as for the fine points of the discussion that follows in the next two 
sections, please refer to [Baites and Popovic, 1986]. The simplest Hall device is the Hail- 
voltage sensor. This is a four terminal device with two current terminals and two voltage 
terminals to measure the Hail-voltage (Figure 2). A mag, letic field B in the direction 
perpendicular to the current flow, sets up the Hall-voltage in the direction indicated in the 
figure. The Hail-voltage is such that it compensates for the Lorentz force on the charge 
carders. In the experiment below, we have used a MOS Hall generator instead of a bulk 
device. The two current contacts are the source and drain of the device and the voltage 
contacts are formed by small diffusion areas in the channel. The Hall-voltage is linearly 
related to the magnetic induction B and the total current in the sample I between the 
drain and the source which is controlled by the gate voltage Vgs.

The constant of proportionality K is related to the dimensions of the device and to 
silicon electronic transport parameters. The device dimensions and biasing conditions are 
shown in the figure above. Note that the Hall voltage reverses, when the direction of the 
magnetic field is reverse& The above device was fabricated in a standard 2-micron n-well 
CMOS process through MOSIS (production run M89P). The signal output of this 
sensor is a voltage and is relatively small. For the same biasing conditions, the signals 
can be increased only if the channel is made shorter (increase the transconductance of the 
device). On the otherhand, when the length of the device approaches its width the Hall- 
voltage is shorted out by the heavily doped source and drain regions and the signal 
degrades again. Some of the problems with the Hall-voltage sensor can be avoided if we 
use a device that gives a current
