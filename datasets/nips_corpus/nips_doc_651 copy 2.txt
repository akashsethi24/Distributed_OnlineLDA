Abstract 
The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) is a compensatory eye movement that 
stabilizes images on the retina during head turns. Its magnitude, or gain, 
can be modified by visual experience during head movements. Possible 
learning mechanisms for this adaptation have been explored in a model 
of the oculomotor system based on anatomical and physiological con- 
straints. The local correlational learning rules in our model reproduce the 
adaptation and behavior of the VOR under certain parameter conditions. 
From these conditions, predictions for the time course of adaptation at 
the learning sites are made. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
The primate oculomotor system is capable of maintaining the image of an object on the 
fovea even when the head and object are moving simultaneously. The vestibular organs 
provide information about the head velocity with a short delay of 14 ms but visual signals 
from the moving object are relatively slow and can take 100 ms to affect eye movements. 
The gain, G, of the VOR, defined as minus the eye velocity over the head velocity (-6/}), 
can be modified by wearing magnifying or diminishing glasses (figure 1). VOR adaptation, 
absent in the dark, is driven by the combination of image slip on the retina and head turns.

During head turns on the first day of wearing magnifying glasses, the magnified image of 
an object slips on the retina. After a few days of adaptation, the eye velocity and hence the 
gain of the VOR increases to compensate for the image magnification. 
We have constructed a model of the VOR and smooth pursuit systems that uses biologically 
plausible local learning rules that are consistent with anatomical pathways and physiological 
recordings. The learning rules in the model are local in the sense that the adaptation of a 
synapse depends solely on signals that are locally available. A similar model with different 
local learning rules has been recently proposed (Quinn et al., Neuroscience 1992).

2 THE MODEL 
Feedforward and recurrent models of the VOR have been proposed (Fujita, 1982; Galiana, 
1986; Kawato and Gomi, 1992; Quinn et al., 1992; Arnold and Robinson, 1992; Lisberger 
and Sejnowski, 1992). In this paper we study a static and linear version of a previously 
studied recurrent network model of the VOR and smooth pursuit system (Lisberger, 1992; 
Lisberger and Sejnowski, 1992; Viola, Lisberger and Sejnowski, 1992). The time delays 
and time constants associated with nodes in the network were eliminated so that the time 
course of the VOR plasticity could be more easily analyzed (figure 2). 
The model describes the system ipsilateral to one eye. The visual error, which carries the 
image retinal slip velocity signal, is a measure of the performance of both the VOR and 
smooth pursuit system as well as the main error signal for learning. The value at each node 
represents changes in its firing rate from its resting firing rate. The transformation from the 
rate of firing of premotor signal (N) to eye velocity is represented in the model by a gain

Figure 2: Diagram of the VOR and smooth pursuit model. The input and output of the model are, 
respectively, head velocity and eye velocity. The model has three main parts: the node P represents 
an ensemble of Purkinje cells from the ventral parafiocculus of the cerebellum, the node N represents 
an ensemble of fiocculus-target neurons in the vestibular nucleus, and the visual inputs which provide 
the visual error signals in the mossy and climbing fibers. The capital letter gains A and D, multiplying 
the input signals to the nodes, are modified according to their learning rules. The lower case letters 
b, v, and 0 are also multiplicative gains, but remain constant during adaptation. The traces represent 
head and eye velocity modulation in time. The visual error signal in the climbing fibers drives learning 
in node N but does not constitute one of its inputs in the present model.

3 LEARNING RULES 
We have adopted the learning rules proposed by Marr (1969), Albus (1971) and Ito (1970) 
for adaptation in the cerebellum and by Lisberger (1988), Miles and Lisberger (1981) for 
plasticity in the brain stem (figure 3). These are variations of the delta rule and depend on 
an explicit representation of the error signal at the synapses. 
Long term depression at mossy fiber synapses on Purkinje cells has been observed in 
vitro under simultaneous stimulation of climbing fibers and mossy fibers (Ito, Sakurai and 
Tongroach, 1982). In addition, we have included a learning mechanism for potentiation 
of mossy fiber head velocity inputs under concurrent mossy fiber visual and head velocity 
inputs. Although the climbing fiber inputs to the cerebellum were not directly represented 
in this model (figure 2), the image velocity signal carried by the mossy fibers to P was used 
in the model to achieve the same result. 
There is good indirect evidence that learning also occurs in the vestibular nucleus. We 
have adopted the suggestion of Lisberger (1988) that the effectiveness of the head velocity 
input to some neurons in the vestibular nucleus may be modified by head velocity input in

Figure 3: Learning rules for the cerebellum and vestibular nucleus. The gains A and D change 
according to the correlation of their input signal and the error signal to the node, as shown for A at 
the top. The parameter q determines the proportion of learning from Purkinje cell inputs compared 
to learning from climbing fiber inputs. When q = 1, only Purkinje cell inputs drive the adaptation at 
node N; if q = 0, learning occurs solely from climbing fiber inputs. 
association with Purkinje cells firing. We have also added adaptation from pairing the head 
velocity input with climbing fiber firing. The relative effectiveness of these two learning 
mechanisms is controlled by the parameter q (figure 3). 
Learning for gain D depends on the interplay between several signals. If the VOR gain is 
too small, a rightward head turn P (positive value for head velocity) results in too small a 
leftward eye turn (a negative value for eye velocity). Consequently, the visual scene appears 
to move to the left (negative image slip). P then fires below its resting level (negative) and 
its inhibitory influence on N decreases so that N increases its firing rate (figure 4 bottom 
left). This corrects the VOR gain and increases gain D according to figure 3. Concurrently, 
the climbing fiber visual signal is above resting firing rate (positive) which also leads to an 
increase in gain D. 
Since the signal passing through gain A has an inhibitoryinfluence via P onto N, decreasing 
gain A has the opposite effect on the eye velocity as decreasing gain D. Hence, if the VOR 
is too small we expect gain A to decrease. This is what happens during the early phase of 
learning (figure 4 top left). 
4 RESULTS 
Finite difference equations of the learning rules were used to calculate changes in gains A 
and D at the end of each cycle during our simulations. A cycle was defined as one biphasic
