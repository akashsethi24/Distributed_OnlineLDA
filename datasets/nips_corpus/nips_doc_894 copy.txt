Abstract 
A model of the hippocampus is presented which forms rapid self-orga- 
nized representations of input arriving via the perforant path, performs 
recall of previous associations in region CA3, and performs comparison 
of this recall with afferent input in region CA1. This comparison drives 
feedback regulation of cholinergic modulation to set appropriate 
dynamics for learning of new representations in region CA3 and CA1. 
The network responds to novel patterns with increased cholinergic mod- 
ulation, allowing storage of new self-organized representations, but 
responds to familiar patterns with a decrease in acetylcholine, allowing 
recall based on previous representations. This requires selectivity of the 
cholinergic suppression of synaptic transmission in stratum radiatum of 
regions CA3 and CA1, which has been demonstrated experimentally. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
A number of models of hippocampal function have been developed (Burgess et al., 1994; 
Myers and Gluck, 1994; Touretzky et al., 1994), but remarkably few simulations have 
addressed hippocampal function within the constraints provided by physiological and ana- 
tomical data. Theories of the function of specific subregions of the hippocampal forma- 
tion often do not address physiological mechanisms for changing dynamics between 
learning of novel stimuli and recall of familiar stimuli. For example, the afferent input to 
the hippocampus has been proposed to form orthogonal representations of entorhinal 
activity (Mart, 1971; McNaughton and Morris, 1987; Eichenbaum and Buckingham, 
1990), but simulations have not addressed the problem of when these representations

should remain stable, and when they should be altered. In addition, models of autoasso- 
ciative memory function in region CA3 (Mart, 1971; McNaughton and Morris, 1987; 
Levy, 1989; Eichenbaum and Buckingham, 1990) and heteroassociative memory function 
at the Schaffer collaterals projecting from region CA3 to CA1 (Levy, 1989; McNaughton, 
1991) require very different activation dynamics during learning versus recall. 
Acetylcholine may set appropriate dynamics for storing new information in the cortex 
(Hasselmo et al., 1992, 1993; Hasselmo, 1993, 1994; Hasselmo and Bower, 1993). Ace- 
tylcholine has been shown to selectively suppress synaptic transmission at intrinsic but 
not afferent fiber synapses (Hasselmo and Bower, 1992), to suppress the neuronal adapta- 
tion of cortical pyramidal cells (Hasselmo et al., 1994; Barkai and Hasselmo, 1994), and 
to enhance long-term potentiation of synaptic potentials (Hasselmo, 1994b). Models 
show that suppression of synaptic transmission during learning prevents recall of previ- 
ously stored information from interfering with the storage of new information (Hasselmo 
et al., 1992, 1993; Hasselmo, 1993, 1994a), while cholinergic enhancement of synaptic 
modification enhances the rate of learning (Hasselmo, 1994b). 
Feedback regulation of cholinergic modulation may set the appropriate level of cholin- 
ergic modulation dependent upon the novelty or familiarity of a particular input pattern. 
We have explored possible mechanisms for the feedback regulation of cholinergic modu- 
lation in simulations of region CA1 (Hasselmo and Schnell, 1994) and region CA3. Here 
we show that self-regulated learning and recall of self-organized representations can be 
obtained in a network simulation of the hippocampal formation. This model utilizes selec- 
tive cholinergic suppression of synaptic transmission in stratum radiatum of region CA3, 
which has been demonstrated in brain slice preparations of the hippocampus. 
2 METHODS 
2.1. SIMPLIFIED REPRESENTATION OF HIPPOCAMPAL NEURONS. 
In place of the sigmoid input-output functions used in many models, this model uses a 
simple representation in which the output of a neuron is not explicitly constrained, but the 
total network activity is regulated by feedback from inhibitory interneurons and adapta- 
tion due to intracellular calcium concentration. Separate variables represent pyramidal 
cell membrane potential a, intracellular calcium concentration c, and the membrane poten- 
tial of inhibitory intemeurons h:

cium-dependent potassium current (proportional to intracellular calcium), Wij = excitatory 
recurrent synapses (longitudinal association path terminating in stratum radiatum), gO is a 
threshold linear function proportional to the amount by which membrane potential

inhibitory intemeurons, Hik = inhibitory synapses from intemeurons to pyramidal cells, 
Hkl= inhibitory synapses between intemeurons. This representation gives neurons adapta- 
tion characteristics similar to those observed with intracellular recording (Barkai and Has- 
selmo, 1994), including a prominent afterhyperpolarization potential (see Figure 1).

Figure 1. Comparison of pyramidal cell model with experimental data. 
In Figure 1, A shows the membrane potential of a modeled pyramidal cell in response to 
simulated current injection. Output of this model is a continuous variable proportional to 
how much membrane potential exceeds threshold. This is analogous to the reciprocal of 
interspike interval in real neuronal recordings. Note that the model displays adaptation 
during current injection and afterhyperpolarization afterwards, due to the calcium-depen- 
dent potassium current. B shows the intracellularly recorded membrane potential in a pir- 
iform cortex pyramidal cell, demonstrating adaptation of fu'ing frequency due to 
activation of calcium-dependent potassium current. The firing rate falls off in a manner 
similar to the smooth decrease in firing rate in the simplified representation. C shows an 
intracellular recording illustrating long-term afterhyperpolarization caused by calcium 
influx induced by spiking of the neuron during current injection. 
2.2. NETWORK CONNECTIVITY 
A schematic representation of the network simulation of the hippocampal formation is 
shown in Figure 2. The anatomy of the hippocampal formation is summarized on the left 
in A, and the function of these different subregions in the model is shown on the right in 
B. Each of the subregions in the model contained a population of excitatory neurons with 
a single inhibitory intemeuron mediating feedback inhibition and keeping excitatory 
activity bounded. Thus, the local activation dynamics in each region follow the equations 
presented above. The connectivity of the network is further summarized in Figure 3 in the 
Results section. A learning rule of the Hebbian type was utilized at all synaptic connec- 
tions, with the exception of the mossy fibers from the dentate gyms to region CA3, and the 
connections to and from the medial septurn. Self-organization of perforant path synapses 
was obtained through decay of synapses with only pre or post-synaptic activity, and 
growth of synapses with combined activity. Associative memory function at synapses

arising from region CA3 was obtained through synaptic modification during cholinergic 
suppression of synaptic transmission.

2.3. CHOLINERGIC MODULATION 
The total output from region CA1 determined the level of cholinergic modulation within 
both region CA3 and CA1, with increased output causing decreased modulation. This is 
consistent with experimental evidence suggesting that activity in region CA1 and region 
CA3 can inhibit activity in the medial septurn, and thereby downregulate cholinergic mod- 
ulation. This effect was obtained in the model by excitatory connections from region CA1 
to an inhibitory intemeuron in the medial septurn, which suppressed the activity of a cho- 
linergic neuron providing modulation to the full network. When levels of cholinergic 
modulation were high, there was strong suppression of synaptic transmission at the excite- 
tory recurrent synapses in CA3 and the Schaffer collaterals projecting from region CA3 to 
CA1. This prevented the spread of activity due to previous learning from interfering with 
self-organization. When levels of cholinergic modulation were decreased, the strength of 
synaptic transmission was increased, allowing associative recall to dominate. Cholinergic 
modulation also increased the rate of synaptic modification and alepolarized neurons. 
2.4. TESTS OF SELF-REGULATED LEARNING AND RECALL 
Simulations of the full hippocampal network evaluated the response to the sequential pre- 
sentation of a series of highly overlapping activity patterns in the entorhinal cortex. Recall 
was tested with interspersed presentation of degraded versions of previously presented 
activity patterns. For effective recall, the pattern of activity in entorhinal cortex layer IV 
evoked by degraded patterns matched the pattern evoked by the full learned version of 
these patterns. The function of the full network is illustrated in Fi
