Abstract 
A connection is drawn between rational functions, the realization 
theory of dynamical systems, and feedforward neural networks. 
This allows us to parametrize single hidden layer scalar neural 
networks with (almost) arbitrary analytic activation functions in 
terms of strictly proper rational functions. Hence, we can solve the 
uniqueness of parametrization problem for such networks. 
I INTRODUCTION 
Nonlinearly parametrized representations of functions b:  --  of the form 
(1.1) b(x) -  ci(x - ai) x  , 
i-1 
have attracted considerable attention recently in the neural network literature. 
a:  -  is typically a sigmoidal function such as 
(1.2) a(x) = (1 + e-) -x, 
but other choices than (1.2) are possible and of interest. 
representations such as 
(1.3) b(x) -  cia(bix-ai) 
i=1

Sometimes more complex

or even compositions of these are considered. 
The purpose of this paper is to explore some parametrization issues regarding (1.1) 
and in particular to show the close connection these representations have with the 
standard system-theoretic realization theory for rational functions. We show how 
to define a generalization of (1.1) parametrized by (A, b, c), where A is a matrix 
over a field, and b and c are vectors. (This is made more precise below). The 
parametrization involves the (A, b, c) being used to define a rational function. The 
generalized r-representation is then defined in terms of the rational function. This 
connection allows us to use results available for rational functions in the study of 
neural-network representations such as (1.1). It will also lead to an understanding 
of the geometry of the space of functions. 
One of the main contributions of the paper is to show how in general neural network 
representations are related to rational functions. In this summary all proofs have 
been omitted. A complete version of the paper is available from the second author. 
2 REALIZATIONS RELATIVE TO A FUNCTION 
In this section we explore the relationship between sigmoidal representations of real 
analytic functions b' lI -. IR defined on an interval lI C IR, real rational functions 
defined on the complex plane C, 
linear dynamical systems 
y(t) 
and the well established realization theory for 
= Az(t) +bu(t) 
= cx(t) + 
For standard textbooks on systems theory and realization theory we refer to [5, 7]. 
Let lK denote either the field IR of real numbers or the field C of complex numbers. 
Let A C C be an open and simply connected subset of the complex plane and let 
r: A -. C be an analytic function defined on A. For example, a may be obtained 
by an analytic continuation of some sigmoidal function a: IR -. IR into the domain 
of holomorphy of the complex plane. 
Let T: � -* � be a linear operator on a finite-dimensional K-vector space � such 
that T has all its eigenvalues in A. Let I' C A be a simple closed curve, oriented 
in the counter-clockwise direction, enclosing all the eigenvalues of T in its interior. 
More generally, I' may consist of a finite number of simple closed curves I'k with 
interiors A such that the union of the domains A contains all the eigenvalues of 
T. Then the matrix valued function rr(T) is defined as the contour integral [8, p.44]

becomes a function of the complex variable z, at least as long as F contains all the 
eigenvalues of zI + A. Using the change of variables  := z - z we obtain 
(2.2) a(zI + A) = 1 fr a(z + ')('I- A) -1 d, 
2ri , 
where I = I' - z C A encircles all the eigenvalues of A. 
Given an arbitrary vector b  � and a linear functional c:  -- lK we achieve the 
representation

Let 4: 1I -. 11 be a real analytic function in a single variable z  1I, defined on an 
interval 1I C 11. 
Definition 2.1 A quadruple (A, b, c, d) is called a finite-dimensional a-realization 
of qS : lI --.  over a field of constants IK if for all z  lI 
(2.6) 4,(x) = ca(x + A)t, + a 
holds, where the right hand side is given by (�.$) and F is assumed to satisfy the 
conditions (�.d)-(�.5). Here d  lK, b  �, and A: � --* �, c:  -- lK are lK-linear 
maps and � is a finite dimensional lK-vector space. 
Definition 2.2 The dimension (or degree) of a a-realization is dim:�. The r- 
degree of qS, denoted 5(q5), is the minimal dimension of all a-realizations of qS. A 
minimal a-realization is a a-realization of minimal dimension 5 (qS). 
a-realizations are a straightforward extension of the system-theoretic notion of a 
realization of a transfer function. In this paper we will address the following specific 
questions concerning a-realizations. 
Q1 What are the existence and uniqueness properties of a-realizations? 
Q2 How can one characterize minimal a-realizations? 
qa How can one compute 
3 EXISTENCE OF a-REALIZATIONS 
We now consider the question of existence of a-realizations. To set the stage, we 
consider the systems theory case a(z) = z -1 first. Assume we are given a formal 
power series

and that (A, b, c) is a a-realization in the sense of definition 2.1. The Taylor expan- 
sion of c(xI 4- A)-lb at 0 is (for A nonsingular) 
(3.2) c(xI 4- A)-lb '- -.(-1) / cA-('+l)bx '. 
i--0 
Thus 
65i = (_l)icA_(i+l)b ' i = O, N. 
(3.3) ..., 
if and only if the expansions of (3.1) and (3.2) coincide up to order N. Observe [7] 
that 
c)(x) = c(xI + A)-lb and dim� < c 
4(x) is rational with 4(c) = 0. 
The possibility of solving (3.3) is now easily seen as follows. Let V = ]I N'F1 -- 
Map({0,..., N},IR)be the finite or infinite (N + 1)-fold product space of I. (Here 
Map(X, Y) denotes the set of all maps from X to Y.) If N is finite let

We then have 
x i be analytic at x = 0 and let (A,b,c) be a a-

realization of the formal power series 4(x) = ]]=0 xi N < cx> (i.e. matching of 
the first N + 1 derivatives of c)(x) and cer(xI + A)b at x = 0). Then 
(3.6) 
qSi = cr(i)(A)b for i = 0,... , N. 
Observe that for er(x) = x -1 we have er(i)(-A) = i!(A-1) i+1 as before. The exis- 
tence part of the realization question Q1 can now be restated as 
v'�� x i and a sequence of real numbers (qb0, N), does 
Q4 Given r(x) := z_,i=0 i! '' 
there exist an (A, b, c) with 
(3.7) 4i = ca(0(A)b, i= 0,... ,N?

Thus question Q1 is essentially a Loewner interpolation question [1, 3]. 
Let 7 = cAtb, �  H0, and let

, and [4]= 
Then (3.6) (for N = ) can formally be written as 
(3.10) [0] = F. [7]. 
Of course, any meaningful interpretation of (3.10) requires that the infinite sums 
j-0 ',_y__z. i � N0, exist. This happens, for example, if j :0 a/+j < , i  N0 
j! I. , 
and -]j=0 (7J/J!) 2 < cx exist. We have already seen that every finite or infinite 
sequence [71 has a realization (A, b, c). Thus we obtain 
Corollary 3.2 A function ok(a:) admits a a-realization if and only if [b] � 
image(F). 
Corollary 3.3 Let H = (7i+j )i,j=o. There exists a finite dimensional tr-realization 
of ck(x) if and only if [,] = F[?] with rank H < co. In this case 5(,) = rank H. 
4 UNIQUENESS OF a-REALIZATIONS 
In this section we consider the uniqueness of the representation (2.3). 
Definition 4.1 (c.f. [21) A system {gl,... ,g,} of continuous functions gi' lI --+ 
1, defined on an interval lI C 1, is said to satisfy a Haft* condition of order 
n on lI if gl,...,g, are linearly independent, i.e. For every cl,..., c,  1 with 
Z?=l cigi(x) = 0 for all x � then cl =...= c. = 0.

that

Theorem 4.4 (Uniqueness).Let a' 1I --+ 1I be Haar generating of order at least
