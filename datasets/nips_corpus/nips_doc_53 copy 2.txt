ABSTRACT 
We describe two expriments in optical neural computing. In the first 
a closed optical feedback loop is used to implement auto-associative image 
recall. In the second a perceptron-like learning algorithm is implemented with 
photorefractive holography. 
INTRODUCTION 
The hardware needs of many neural computing systems are well matched 
with the capabilities of optical systems '2's The high interconnectivity 
required by neural computers can be simply implemented in optics because 
channels for optical signals may be superimposed in three dimensions with 
little or no cross coupling. Since these channels may be formed holographically, 
optical neural systems can be designed to create and maintain interconnections 
very simply. Thus the optical system designer can to a large extent 
avoid the analytical and topological problems of determining individual 
interconnections for a given neural system and constructing physical paths 
for these interconnections. 
An archetypical design for a single layer of an optical neural computer is 
shown in Fig. 1. Nonlinear thresholding elements, neurons, are arranged on 
two dimensional planes which are interconnected via the third dimension by 
holographic elements. The key concerns in implementing this design involve 
the need for suitable nonlinearities for the neural planes and high capacity, 
easily modifiable holographic elements. While it is possible to implement the 
neural function using entirely optical nonlinearities, for example using etaIon 
arrays 4, optoelectronic two dimensional spatial light modulators (2D SLMs) 
suitable for this purpose are more readily available. and their properties, 
i.e. speed and resolution, are well matched with the requirements of neural 
computation and the limitations imposed on the system by the holographic 
interconnections 5,6. Just as the main advantage of optics in connectionist 
machines is the fact that an optical system is generally linear and thus 
allows the superposition of connections, the main disadvantage of optics is 
that good optical nonlinearities are hard to obtain. Thus most SLMs are 
optoelectronic with a non-linearity mediated by electronic effects. The need for 
optical nonlinearities arises again when we consider the formation of modifiable 
optical interconnections, which must be an all optical process. In selecting

a holographic material for a neural computing application we would like to 
have the capability of real-time recording and slow erasure. Materials such 
as photographic film can provide this only with an impractical fixing process. 
Photorefractive crystals are nonlinear optical materials that promise to have 
a relatively fast recording response and long term memory 4'5'6'7'8

In this paper we describe two experimental implementations of optical 
neural computers which demonstrate how currently available optical devices 
may be used in this application. The first experiment we describe involves an 
optical associative loop which uses feedback through a neural plane in the form 
of a pinhole array and a separate thresholding plane to implement associate 
regeneration of stored patterns from correlated inputs. This experiment 
demonstrates the input-output dynamics of an optical neural computer similar 
to that shown in Fig. 1, implemented using the Hughes Liquid Crystal Light 
Valve. The second experiment we describe is a single neuron optical perceptron 
implemented with a photorefractive crystal. This experiment demonstrates 
how the learning dynamics of long term memory may be controlled optically. 
By combining these two experiments we should eventually be able to construct 
high capacity adaptive optical neural computers. 
OPTICAL ASSOCIATIVE LOOP 
A schematic diagram of the optical associative memory loop is shown in 
Fig. 2. It is comprised of two cascaded Vander Lugt corrclators 9. The input 
section of the system from the threshold device P1 through the first hologram 
P2 to the pinhole array P3 forms the first correlator. The feedback section 
from P3 through the second hologram P4 back to the threshold device P1 
forms the second corrclator. An array of pinholes sits on the back focal plane 
of L2, which coincides with the front focal plane of L3. The purpose of the 
pinholes is to link the first and the second (reversed) correlator to form a closed 
optical feedback loop �. 
There are two phases in operating this optical loop, the learning phase 
and the recal phase. In the learning phase, the images to be stored are 
spatially multiplexcd and entered simultaneously on the threshold device. The 
379 
thresholded images are Fourier transformed by the lens L1. The Fourier 
spectrum and a plane wave reference beam interfere at the plane P2 and 
record a Fourier transform hologram. This hologram is moved to plane P4 
as our stored memory. We then reconstruct the images from the memory to 
form a new input to make a second Fourier transform hologram that will stay 
at plane P2. This completes the 
learning phase. In the recalling phase 
an input is imaged on the threshold 
device. This image is correlated with 
the reference images in the hologram 
at P2. If the correlation between the 
input and one of the stored images is 
high a bright peak appears at one of 
the pinholes. This peak is sampled by 
the pinhole to reconstruct the stored 
image from the hologram at P4. The 
reconstructed beam is then imaged 
back to the threshold device to form a 
closed loop. If the overall optical gain 
in the loop exceeds the loss the loop 
signal will grow until the threshold 
device is saturated. In this case, we 
can cutoff the external input image 
and the optical loop will be latched at 
the stable memory.

The key elements in this optical loop arc the holograms, the pinhole array, 
and the threshold device. If we put a mirror � or a phase conjugate mirror TM  
at the pinhole plane P3 to reflect the correlation signal back through the 
system then we only need one hologram to form a closed loop. The use of two 
holograms, however, improves system performance. We make the hologram at 
P2 with a high pass characteristic so that the input section of the loop has 
high spectral discrimination. On the other hand we want the images to be 
reconstructed with high fidelity to the original images. Thus the hologram at 
plane P4 must have broadband characteristics. We use a diffuser to achieve 
this when making this hologram. Fig. 3a shows the original images. Fig. 3b 
and Fig. 3c are the images reconstructed from first and second holograms, 
respectively. As desired, Fig. 3b is a high pass version of the stored image 
while Fig. 3c is broadband. 
Each of the pinholes at the correlation plane P3 has a diameter of 60 
/ra. The separations between the pinholes correspond to the separations of 
the input images at plane P1. If one of the stored images appears at PI there 
will be a bright spot at the corresponding pinhole on plane P3. If the input 
image shifts to the position of another image the correlation peak will also

shift to another pinhole. But if the shift is not an exact image spacing the 
correlation peak can not pass the pinhole and we lose the feedback signal. 
Therefore this is a loop with discrete shift invariance. Without the pinholes 
the cross-correlation noise and the auto-correlation peak will be fed back to 
the loop together and the reconstructed images won't be recognizable. There 
is a compromise between the pinhole size and the loop performance. Small 
pinholes allow good memory discrimination and sharp reconstructed images, 
but can cut the signal to below the level that can be detected by the threshold 
device and reduce the tolerance of the system to shifts in the input. The 
function of the pinhole array in this system might also be met by a nonlinear 
spatial light modulator, in which case we can achieve full shift invariance 2. 
The threshold device at plane P1 is a Hughes Liquid Crystal Light Valve. 
The device has a resolution of 16 lp/mm and uniform aperture of I inch 
diameter. This gives us about 160,000 neurons at P1. In order to compensate 
for the optical loss in the loop, which is on the order of 10 -5 , we need the 
neurons to provide gain on the order of 105 . In our system this is achieved 
by placing a Hamamatsu image intensifier at the write side of the LCLV. 
Since the microchannel plate of the image intensifier can give gains of 104, the 
combination of the LCLV and the image intensifier can give gains of 106 with 
sensitivity down to nW/cm 2. The optical gain in the loop can be adjusted by 
changing the gain of the image intensifier. 
Since the activity of neurons and the dynamics of the memory loop is 
a continuously evolving phenomenon, we need to have a real time device to 
monitor and record this behavior. We do this by using a prism beam splitter 
to take part of the read out beam from the LCLV and image it onto a CCD 
camera. The output is displayed on a CRT monitor and also recorded on a 
video tape recorder. Unfortunately, in a paper we can only show static pictures 
taken from the screen. We put a window at the CCD plane so that each time 
we can pick up one of the stored images. Fig. 4a shows the read out
