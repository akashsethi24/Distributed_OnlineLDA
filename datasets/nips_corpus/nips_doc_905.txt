Abstract 
Almost all models of orientation and direction selectivity in visual 
cortex are based on feedforward connection schemes, where genicu- 
late input provides all excitation to both pyramidal and inhibitory 
neurons. The latter neurons then suppress the response of the for- 
mer for non-optimal stimuli. However, anatomical studies show 
that up to 90 % of the excitatory synaptic input onto any corti- 
cal cell is provided by other cortical cells. The massive excitatory 
feedback nature of cortical circuits is embedded in the canonical 
microcircuit of Douglas & Martin (1991). We here investigate ana- 
lytically and through biologically realistic simulations the function- 
ing of a detailed model of this circuitry, operating in a hysterelic 
mode. In the model, weak geniculate input is dramatically ampli- 
fied by intracortical excitation, while inhibition has a dual role: (i) 
to prevent the early geniculate-induced excitation in the null di- 
rection and (ii) to restrain excitation and ensure that the neurons 
fire only when the stimulus is in their receptive-field. Among the 
4 Humbert Suarez, Christof Koch, Rodney Douglas 
insights gained are the possibility that hysteresis underlies visual 
cortical function, paralleling proposals for short-term memory, and 
strong limitations on linearity tests that use gratings. Properties 
of visual cortical neurons are compared in detail to this model and 
to a classical model of direction selectivity that does not include 
excitatory cortico-cortical connections. The model explain a num- 
ber of puzzling features of direction-selective simple cells, includ- 
ing the small somatic input conductance changes that have been 
measured experimentally during stimulation in the null direction. 
The model also allows us to understand why the velocity-response 
curve of area 17 neurons is different from that of their LGN affer- 
ents, and the origin of expansive and compressive nonlinearities in 
the contrast-response curve of striate cortical neurons. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
Direction selectivity is the property of neurons that fire more strongly for one di- 
rection of motion of a bar (the preferred direction) than the other (null direction). 
It is one of the fundamental properties of neurons in visual cortex and is intimately 
related to the processing of motion by the visual system. LGN neurons that provide 
input to visual cortex respond approximately symmetrically to motion in different 
directions; so cortical neurons must generate that direction specificity. Models of 
direction selectivity in primary visual. cortex generally overlook two important con- 
straints. 1. at least 80% of excitatory synapses on cortical pyramidal cells originate 
from other pyramidal cells, and less than 10 % are thalamic afferents (Peters & 
Payne, 1993). 2. Intracellular in vivo recordings in cat simple cells by Douglas, et 
al. (1988) failed to detect significant changes in somatic input conductance during 
stimulation in the null direction, indicating that there is very little synaptic input 
to direction-selective neurons in that condition, including no massive shunting 
inhibition. 
One very attractive solution incorporating these two constraints was proposed by 
Douglas & Martin (1991) in the form of their canonical microcircuit: for motion 
of a visual stimulus in the preferred direction, weak geniculate excitation excites 
cortical pyramidal cells to respond moderately. This relatively small amount of cor- 
tical excitation is amplified via excitatory cortico-cortical connections. For motion 
in the null direction, the weak geniculate excitation is vetoed by weak inhibition 
(mediated via an interneuron) and the cortical loop is never activated. In order 
to test quantitatively this circuit against the large body of experimental data, it 
is imperative to model its operation through mathematical analysis and detailed 
simulations. 
2 MODEL DESCRIPTION AND ANALYSIS 
The model consists of a retino-geniculate and a cortical stage (Fig. 1). The former 
includes a center-surround receptive field and bandpass temporal filtering (Victor, 
1987). We simulate a 1-D array of ON LGN neurons, with 208 LGN neurons at each 
of 6 spatial positions in this array. The output of the LGN--action potentials--feeds

into the cortical module consisting of 640 pyramidal (excitatory) and 160 inhibitory 
neurons. Each neuron is modeled using 3~4 compartments whose parameters reflect, 
in a simplified way, the biophysics and morphology of cortical neurons; the somatic 
compartment produces action potentials in response to current injection. There are 
excitatory connections among all pyramidal neurons, and inhibitory confiections 
from the inhibitory population to itself and to the pyramidal population. The 
receptive field of the geniculate input to the inhibitory cortical neurons is displaced 
in space from the geniculate input to the pyramidal neurons, so that in the null 
direction inhibition overlaps with geniculate excitation in the pyramidal neurons, 
resulting in direction selectivity in the pyramidal neurons. The time courses of 
the post-synaptic potentials (PSP's) are consistent with physiologically recorded 
PSP's. The EPSP's in our model arise exclusively from non-NMDA synapses, and 
the IPSP's originate from both GABAA and GABAr synapses. 
There are two operating modes of this cortical amplifier circuit, depending on pa- 
rameter values. In the first mode, the pyramidal neurons' response increases pro- 
portionally to the stimulus strength over a substantial range of input values, before 
saturating. In the second mode, the response increases much faster over a narrow 
range of stimulus strengths, then saturates. Analytically, one can define a steady- 
state transfer function for the network of pyramidal neurons; then, in the first mode, 
the transfer function has a slope that is less than 1, so that the network's firing rate 
at equilibrium increases proportionally to the input strength and the network dy- 
namics are rather slow. In the second mode the initial slope is larger than 1, so 
that the network can discharge briskly at equilibrium even without any input, show 
hysteresis, and has rather fast dynamics. The network does not fire without any 
input, because of the neuron's threshold. In this paper, we will show responses in 
that second, hysteretic mode of operation. 
We will compare the cortical amplifier model's response properties to a pure feed- 
forward model, that has no excitatory connections between pyramidal neurons. In 
order to maintain strong responses in that model, the LGN was connected more 
strongly to the pyramidal neurons, and in order to maintain direction selectivity, 
the weights of the connections of the inhibitory neurons to the pyramids were in- 
creased as well.

AMPLIFICATION AND CONDUCTANCE CHANGE 
IN THE NULL DIRECTION 
The input conductance of pyramidal neurons, a measure of total synaptic input, 
changes by only 50 % in the cortical amplifier model versus 400 % in the feedfor- 
ward model, and so is more consistent with physiology (Fig. 2). Indeed, most of 
the current causing firing in the preferred direction originates from other pyrami- 
dal neurons, so the connection weight from the LGN is small. Consequently, the 
inhibitory weight is also small, since it needs only be large enough to balance out 
the LGN current in the null direction. Since there is little firing in other pyramidal 
neurons in the null direction, there is also little total synaptic input to the fiducial 
cell. The cortical amplifier circuit provides substantial amplification of the LGN 
input. In the preferred direction, excitatory intracortical connections amplify the 
LGN input, providing a feedback current that is about 2.2 times larger than the
