Abstract 
Cortical amplification has been proposed as a mechanism for enhancing 
the selectivity of neurons in the primary visual cortex. Less appreciated 
is the fact that the same form of amplification can also be used to de-tune 
or broaden selectivity. Using a network model with recurrent cortical 
circuitry, we propose that the spatial phase invariance of complex cell 
responses arises through recurrent amplification of feedforward input. 
Neurons in the network respond like simple cells at low gain and com- 
plex ceils at high gain. Similar recurrent mechanisms may play a role 
in generating invariant representations of feedforward input elsewhere in 
the visual processing pathway. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
Synaptic input to neurons in the primary visual cortex is primarily recurrent, arising from 
other cortical cells. The dominance of this type of connection suggests that it may play an 
important role in cortical information processing. Previous studies proposed that recurrent 
connections amplify weak feedforward input to the cortex (Douglas et al., 1995) and selec- 
tively amplify tuning for specific stimulus characteristics, such as orientation or direction 
of movement (Douglas et al., 1995; Ben-Yishai et al., 1995; Somers et al., 1995; Sompolin- 
sky and Shapley, 1997). Cortical cooling and shocking experiments provide evidence that 
there is cortical amplification through recurrent connections, but they do not show increases 
in orientation or direction selectivity as a result of this amplification (Ferster et al., 1996; 
Chung and Ferster, 1998). Recurrent connections can also decrease neuronal selectivity 
through the same form of amplification, generating responses that are insensitive to certain 
stimulus features. Although the ability to sharpen tuning may be an important feature in 
cortical processing, the capacity to broaden tuning for particular stimulus attributes is also 
desirable. 
Neurons in the primary visual cortex can be divided into two classes based on their re-

sponses to visual stimuli such as counterphase and drifting sinusoidal gratings. Sim- 
ple cells show tuning for orientation, spatial frequency, and spatial phase of a grating 
(Movshon et al., 1978a). Complex cells exhibit orientation and spatial frequency tun- 
ing, but are insensitive to spatial phase (Movshon et al., 1978b). A counterphase grating, 
s(x, t) = cos(Kx - ) cos(t), is one in which the spatial phase, , and spatial frequency, 
K, are held constant but the contrast, s(x, t), varies sinusoidally in time at some frequency 
. In response to a counterphase grating, the activity of a simple cell oscillates at the same 
frequency as the stimulus, . A complex cell response is modulated at twice the frequency, 
2. To create a drifting grating of frequency , s(x, t) = cos(Kx - t), the spatial phase 
and spatial frequency are held constant but the grating is moved at velocity ,/K. A simple 
cell response to a drifting grating is highly modulated at frequency v, while a complex 
cell response to a drifting grating is elevated but relatively unmodulated. The differences 
between complex and simple cell responses are a direct consequence of the complex cell 
spatial phase insensitivity. 
Previous models of complex cells generate spatial-phase invariant responses through con- 
verging sets of feedforward inputs with a wide range of spatial phase preferences but similar 
orientation and spatial frequency selectivities (Hubel and Wiesel, 1962; Mel et al., 1998). 
These models do not incorporate recurrent connections between complex cells, which are 
known to be particularly strong (Toyama et al., 1981). We propose that the spatial phase 
invariance of complex cell responses can arise from a broadening of spatial phase tuning 
by cortical amplification (Chance et al., 1998). The model neurons exhibit simple cell be- 
havior when weakly coupled and complex cell behavior when strongly coupled, suggesting 
that the two classes of neurons in the primary visual cortex may arise from the same basic 
cortical circuit. 
2 THE MODEL 
The activity of neuron i in the model network is characterized by a firing rate r. Each 
neuron sums feedforward and recurrent input and responds as described by the standard 
rate-model equation 
dr 
rr dt = I + y Wjrj - r. 
Ii represents the feedforward input to cell i, W O is the weight of the synapse from neuron 
j to neuron i, and r,- is a time constant. Previous studies have suggested that, for a neuron 
receiving many inputs, r,- is small, closer to a synaptic time constant than the membrane 
time constant (Ben-Yishai et al., 1995; Treves, 1993). Thus we choose r,- = 1 ms. 
The feedforward input describes the response of a simple cell with a Gabor receptive field 
I = dxG(x) dt'H(t')s(z,t - t' , 
+ 
where s(x, t) represents the contrast function of the visual stimulus and the notation [ ]+ 
indicates rectification. The temporal response function is (Adelson and Bergen, 1985) 
H(t,)=exp(_ct,)((ct') 5 (�t') ? ) 
15! 7! ' 
where we use a = I/ms. The spatial filter is a Gabor function, 
(7 = exp  cos(kix - bi), 
where a determines the spatial extent of the receptive field, k is the preferred spatial 
frequency, and bi is the preferred spatial phase. The values of bi are equally distributed

over the interval [-180 �, 180�). To give the neurons a realistic bandwidth, ai is chosen 
such that kio'i = 2.5. Initially we consider a simplified case in which ki = 1 for all cells. 
Later we consider the spatial frequency selectivity of neurons in the network and allow the 
value of ki tO range from 0 to 3.5 cycles/deg. 
In this paper we assume that the model network describes one orientation column of the 
primary visual cortex, and thus all neurons have the same orientation tuning. All stimuli 
are of the optimal orientation for the network. 
Spatial phase tuning is selectively broadened in the model because the strength of a recur- 
rent connection between two neurons is independent of the spatial phase selectivities of 
their feedforward inputs. In the model with all ki -- 1, the recurrent input is determined by 
g 
Wij - (N- 1)' 
for all i  j. N is the number of cells in the network, and 0 _< g < gmaz, where gmaz is 
the largest value of g for which the network remains stable. In this case graax ---- 1. 
3 RESULTS 
The steady-state solution of the rate-model equation is given by ri ---- Ii q- E Wij'j' TO 
solve this equation, we express the rates and feedfoward inputs in terms of a complete set 
of eigenvectors �' of the recurrent weight matrix,  Wij] = Xt,�' for  = 1, 2,..., N, 
where X are the eigenvalues. The solution is then 
ri = E 1 - X 
t=i 
This equation displays the phenomenon of cortical amplification if one or more of the 
eigenvalues is near one. If we assume only one eigenvalue, Xl, is close to one, the factor 1 - 
Xl in the denominator causes the  = 1 term to dominate and we find ri m i x  IjJ (1 - 
Xl) -1. The input combination  Ijj 1. dominates the response, determining selectivity, 
and this mode is amplified by a factor 1/(1 - Xl). We refer to this amplification factor as 
the cortical gain. 
In the case where Wiy = g/(N - 1) for i  j, the largest eigenvalue is Xl -- g and the 
corresponding eigenvector has all components equal to each other. For g near one, the re- 
current input to neuron i is then proportional to Y,j [cos((I)- bj)]+ which, for large numbers 
of cells with uniformly placed preferred spatial phases �i, is approximately independent of 
(I), the spatial phase of the stimulus. When g is near zero, the network is at low gain and 
the response of neuron i is roughly proportional to its feedforward input, [cos((I) - bj)] +, 
and is sensitive to spatial phase. 
The response properties of simple and complex cells to drifting and counterphase gratings 
are duplicated by the model neuron, as shown in figure 1. For low gain (gain = 1, top panels 
of figures 1A and lB), the neuron acts as a simple cell and its activity is modulated at the 
same frequency as the stimulus (a for counterphase gratings and t for drifting gratings). 
At high gain (gain = 20), the neuron responds like a complex cell, exhibiting frequency 
doubling in the response to a counterphase grating (bottom panel of Figure 1A) and an 
elevated DC response to a drifting grating (bottom panel, Figure lB). Intermediate gain 
(gain = 5) produces intermediate behavior (middle panels). 
The basis of this model is that the amplified mode is independent of spatial phase. If 
the amplified mode depends on spatial frequency or orientation, neurons at high gain can 
be selective for these attributes. To show that the model can retain selectivity for other

stimulus characteristics while maintaining spatial phase insensitivity, we allowed the spatial 
frequency selectivity which each neuron receives from its feedforward input, ki, to vary 
from neuron to neuron and also modified the recurrent weight matrix so that the strength 
of the connection between two neurons, i and j, depends on ki - kj.
