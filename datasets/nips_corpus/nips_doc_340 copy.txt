ABSTRACT 
We are exploring the significance of biological complexity for neuronal 
computation. Here we demonstrate that Hebbian synapses in realistical- 
ly-modeled hippocampal pyramidal cells may give rise to two novel 
forms of self-organization in response to structured synaptic input. First, 
on the basis of the electrotonic relationships between synaptic contacts, 
a cell may become tuned to a small subset of its input space. Second, the 
same mechanisms may produce clusters of potentiated synapses across 
the space of the dendrites. The latter type of self-organization may be 
functionally significant in the presence of nonlinear dendritic conduc- 
tanceso 
1 INTRODUCTION 
Long-term potentiation (LTP) is an experimentally observed form of synaptic plasticity 
that has been interpreted as an instance of a Hebbian modification (Kelso et al, 1986; 
Brown et al, 1990). The induction of LTP requires synchronous presynaptic activity and 
postsynaptic alepolarization (Kelso et al, 1986). We have previously developed a detailed 
biophysical model of the LTP observed at synapses onto hippocampal region CA1 pyrami-

dal neurons (Zaclor et al, 1990). The synapses at which this tbrm of LTP occurs are distrib- 
uted across an extensive dendritic arbor (Fig. 1). During synaptic stimulation, the 
membrane voltage at each synapse is different. In this way, a biological neuron differs 
from the processing elements typically used in neural network models, where the postsyn- 
apfic activity can be represented by a single state variable. We have developed an electro- 
tonic model based on an anatomically reconstructed neuron. We have used this model to 
explore how the spatial distribution of inputs and the temporal relationships of their activa- 
tion affect synapfic potentiation. 
2 THE NEURONAL MODEL 
Standard compartmental modeling techniques were used to represent the electrical struc- 
ture of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells. 
2.1 MORPHOLOGY AND ELECTRICAL PARAMETERS 
Morphometric data were obtained from three-dimensional reconstructions (Brown et al., 
1991) of hippocampal neurons (Fig. 1). A correction factor was applied to the membrane 
area based on an estimate for spine density of 2 / grn. The original measurements divided 
a single neuron into 3000-4000 cylinders with an average length of 5.5 grn. For simulation 
purposes, this structure was collapsed into 300-400 compartments, preserving the connec- 
tivity pattern and changes in process diameter. Electrical constants were Rm = 70 ldl-crn 2, 
Cm-- 1 gF/cm 2, Ri = 200 fl-crn (Spruston & Johnston 1990). The membrane was electri- 
cally passive. Synaptic currents were modeled as the sum of fast AMPA and slow NMDA 
conductances on the head of a two-compartment spine (Zador et al., 1990). The AMPA 
conductance was represented by an alpha function (Jack et al., 1975) with time constant of 
1.5 rnsec (Brown and Johnston, 1983). The NMDA conductance was represented by a 
more complicated function with two time constants and a voltage dependence due to volt- 
age-sensitive channel blocking by Mg 2+ ions (see Zador et al., 1990; Brown et al. 1991). 
The initial peak conductances, gastt,a and gJvstoa' were set to 0.5 and 0.1 nS respectively.

2.2 SIMULATION AND SYNAPTIC MODIFICATION 
Simulations were run on a Sun 4/330 workstation using a customized version of NEURON, 
a simulator developed by Michael Hines (Hines, 1989). Prior to a simulation, 5 patterns of 
40 synapses were selected at random from a pool of synapses distributed uniformly over 
the apical and basal dendrites. Simulations were divided into trials of 100 msec. At the 
beginning of each trial a particular pattern of synapses was activated synchronously (3 
stimuli at intervals of 3 msec). The sequential presentation of all 5 selected patterns 
constituted an epoch. An entire simulation consisted of 20 presentation epochs. Over the 
course of each trial, membrane potential was computed at each location in the dendritic 
tree, and these voltages were used to compute weight changes Awij according to the 
Hebbian algorithm described below. After each trial, the actual peak AMPA conductances 
(gal,,a, hereafter denoted g) were scaled by the sigmoidal function 
gmax 
g,, = e  (%- o.5,,) 
1+ 
where t determines the steepness of the sigmoid, and g was set to 1.0 nS. 
The rule for synaptic modification was based on a biophysical interpretation (Kairiss et al., 
1991; Brown et al., 1991) of a generalized bilinear form of Hebbian algorithm (Brown et 
al., 1990): 
Awij =  [ai(t),aj(t ) ] - [ai(t ) ] - �[aj(t) ] -8, (2) 
where et, [, and � are functionals, $ is a constant, a..(t) represents postsynaptic activity and 
a(O represents presynaptic activity. This equation pecifies an interactive form of synaptic 
enhancement combined wth three nomnteractve forms of synaptac depression, all of 
which have possible neurobiological analogs (Brown et al, 1990). The interactive term was 
derived from a biophysical model of LTP induction in a spine (Zador et al. 1990). A sim- 
plified version of this model was used to compute the concentration of caz+-bound calm- 
odulin, [CaM-Ca4]. It has been suggested that CaM-Ca4 may trigger protein kinases 
responsible for LTP induction. In general [CaM-Ca4] was a nonlinear function of subsyn- 
aptic voltage (Zador et al., 1990). 
The biophysical mechanisms underlying synaptic depression are less well understood. The 
constant $ represents a passive decay process and was generally set to zero. The functional 
[ represents heterosynaptic depression based on postsynaptic activity. In these simula- 
tions, [ was proportional the amount of depolarization of the subsynaptic membrane from 
resting potential (Vy,, - V,.,,). The functional � represents homosynaptic depression based 
on presynaptic activity. Hre, � was proportional to the AMPA conductance, which can 
be considered a measure of exclusively presynaptic activity because it is insensitive to 
postsynaptic voltage. The three activity-dependent terms were integrated over the period 
of the trial in order to obtain a measure of weight change. Reinterpreting et, [, and � as con- 
stants, the equation is thus: 
Awij = I [tl [CamCa4] - [ (Vsyn- Vr*st) -- �gaMt'a--J] dt'

Figure 2: Interactions among Hebbian synapses produce differing global effects (winning and 
losing patterns) on the basis of the spatial distribution of synapses. The PSP (always measured 
at the soma) due to two different patterns of 40 synapses are plotted as a function of the presentation 
epoch. Initially, pattern 1 (solid line) evoked a slightly greater PSP than pattern 2 (dotted line; in- 
set, top fight). After 20 epochs these responses were reversed: the PSP due to pattern 1 was de- 
pressed while the PSP due to pattern 2 was potentiated (inset, top left). 
3 RESULTS 
Analysis of the simulations revealed self-organization in the form of differential modifica- 
tion of synaptic strengths (Mainen et al. 1990). Two aspects of the self-organization phe- 
nomena were distinguished. In some simulations, a form of pattern selection was observed 
in which clearwinners and losers emerged. In other simulations, the average synaptic 
efficacy remained about the same, but spatial heterogeneities clustering---of synaptic 
strength developed. Different measures were used to assess these phenomena. 
3.1 PATTERN SELECTION 
The change in the peak postsynaptic potential recorded at the soma (PSP) provided one use- 
ful measure of pattern selection. In many simulations, pattern selection resulted in a 
marked potentiation of the PSP due to some patterns and a depression of the PSP due to 
others. The PSP can be regarded as an indirect measure of the functional consequence of 
self-organization. In the simulation illustrated in Fig. 2, patterns of 40 synapses produced 
an average PSP of 15 mV before learning. After learning, responses ranged from 10% to 
150% of this amount Underlyinjg. pattem selection was a change in the average peak syn- 
aptic conductance for the pattemg,y,0). 1 The initial value of ,,y,, was the same for all pat- 
terns, and its final value was bounded by eq. 1. In many simulations, ,y, approached the 
upper bound for some patterns and the lower bound for other patterns (Fig. 3). In this way, 
the neuron became selectively tuned to a subset of its original set of inputs. The specificity

3.2 CLUSTER FORMATION 
Heterogeneity in the spatial distribution of strengthened and weakened synapses was often 
observed. After learning, spatial clusters of synapses with similar conductances formed. 
These spatial heterogeneities can be illustrated in several ways. In one convenient me
