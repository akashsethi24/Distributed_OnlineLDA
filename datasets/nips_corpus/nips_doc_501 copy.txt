Abstract 
A network model with temporal sequencing and state-dependent modula- 
tory features is described. The model is motivated by neurocognitive data 
characterizing different states of waking and sleeping. Computer studies 
demonstrate how unique states of sequencing can exist within the same 
network under different aminergic and cholinergic modulatory influences. 
Relationships between state-dependent modulation, memory, sequencing 
and learning are discussed. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
Models of biological information processing often assume only one mode or state 
of operation. In general, this state depends upon a high degree of fidelity or mod- 
ulation among the neural elements. In contrast, real neural networks often have 
a repertoire of processing states that is greatly affected by the relative balances of 
various neuromodulators (Selverston, 1988; Harris-Warrick and Marder, 1991). One 
area where changes in neuromodulation and network behavior are tightly and dra- 
matically coupled is in the sleep-wake cycle (Hobson and Steriade, 1986; Mamelak 
and Hobson, 1989). This cycle consists of three main states: wake, non-rapid eye

movement (NREM) sleep and rapid eye movement (ITEM) sleep. Each state is char- 
acterized by a unique balance of monoaminergic and cholinergic neuromodulation 
(Hobson and Steriale, 1986; figure 1). In humans, each state also has character- 
istic cognitive sequencing properties (Foulkes, 1985; Hobson, 1988; figure 1). An 
integration and better understanding of the complex relationships between neuro- 
modulation and information sequencing are desirable from both a computational 
and a neurophysiological perspective. In this paper, we present an initial approach 
to this difficult neurocognitive problem using a network model.

Figure 1: Overview of the three state model which attempts to integrate aspects of 
neuromodulation and cognitive sequencing. The aminergic and cholinergic systems 
are important neuromodulators that filter and amplify, as opposed to initiating or 
carrying, distributed information embedded as memories (e#. A1, A2, A3) in neural 
networks. In the wake state, a relative aminergic dominance exists and the asso- 
ciated network sequencing is logical and progressive. For example, the sequence 
A1 -- A2 transitions to B1 -- B2 when an appropriate input (e#. B1) is present 
at a certain time. The NREM state is characterized by an intermediate aminergic- 
to-cholinergic ratio correlated with ruminative and perseverative sequences. Unex- 
pected or bizarre sequences are found in the REM state, wherein phasic choliner- 
gic inputs dominate and are prominent in the ponto-geniculo-occipital (PGO) brain 
areas. Bizarrehess is manifest by incongruous or mixed memories, such as A2/B1, 
and sequence discontinuities, such as A2  A2/B1  B2, which may be associated 
with PGO bursting in the absence of other external input.

AMINERGIC AND CHOLINERGIC 
NEUROMODULATION 
As outlined in figure 1, there are unique correlations among the aminergic and 
cholinerglc systems and the forms of information sequencing that exist in the states 
of waking and NREM and REM sleep. The following brief discussion, which un- 
doubtably oversimplifies the complicated and widespread actions of these systems, 
highlights some basic and relevant principles. Interested readers are referred to the 
review by Hobson and Steriade (1986) and the article by Hobson et al. in this 
volume for a more detailed presentation. 
The biogenic amines, including norepinephrine, serotonin and dopamine, have 
been implicated as tonic regulators of the signal-to-noise ratio in neural networks 
(e9. Mamelak and Hobson, 19S9). Incteeing (decreasing) the amount of aminerc 
modulation improves (worsens) network fidelity (figure 2a). A standard means of 
modeling this property is by a stochastic or gain factor, analogous to the well-known 
Boltzmann factor/3 = 1/IT, which is present in the network updating rule. 
Complex neuromodulatory effects of acetyleholine depend upon the location and 
types of reeeptors and channels present in different neurons. One main effect is 
facilitatory excitation (figure 2b). Mamelak and Hobson (1989) have suggested 
how the phasie release of aeetyleholine, involving the bursting of PGO eelIs in the 
brainstem, coupled with tonic aminergie demodulation, could induce bifureations 
in information sequencing at the network level. The model described in the next 
section sets out to test this notion.

3 ASSOCIATIVE SEQUENCING NETWORK 
There are several ways to approach the problem of modeling modulatory effects on 
temporal sequencing. We have chosen to commence with an associative network 
that is an extension of the work on models resembling elementary motor pattern 
generators (Kleinreid, 1986; Sompolinsky and Kanter, 1986; Gutfreund and Mezard, 
1988). We consider it to be significant that recent data on brainstem control systems 
show an overlap between sleep-wake regulators and locomotor pattern generators 
(Garda-Rill et al., 1990). 
The network consists of N neural elements with binary values Si - q-l, i -- 1, ..., N, 
corresponding to whether they are firing or not firing. The elements are linked 
together by two kinds of a priorilearned synaptic connections. One kind, 
encodes a set of p uncorrelated patterns {e}=l, p = 1,...,p, where each ' takes 
the value 4-1 with equal probabilities. These patterns correspond to memories that 
are stable until a transition to another memory is made. Transitions in a sequence 
of memories p -- 1 --* 2 -- ... --0 q < p are induced by a second type of connection 
 q--1 
=- ,, ,j. (2) 
Here, ) is a relative weight of the connection types. The average time spent in a 
memory pattern before transitioning to the next one in a sequence is r. At time t, 
the membrane potential is given by

The two terms confined in the brackets reflect intrinsic network interactions, while 
phasic PGO effects are represented by the i(t). Extern inputs, other than PGO 
inputs, to h(t) are denoted by h(t). Dynamic evolution of the network follows the 
updating rule 
+ 1): +1, 
with probability 
1 + e q:2fi[a'(t)-'(t)] }-1. (4) 
In this equation, the amount of aminergic-like modulation is parameterized by ft. 
While updating could be done serially, a parallel dynamic process is chosen here for 
convenience. In the absence of external and PGO-like inputs, and with fl > 1.0, 
the dynamics have the effect of generating trajectories on an adiabatically varying 
hypersurface that molds in time to produce a path from one basin of attraction 
to another. For fl < 1.0, the network begins to lose this property. Lowering fl 
mostly affects neural elements close to threshold, since the decision to change firing 
activity centers around the threshold value. However, as fl decreases, fluctuations 
in the membrane potentials increase and a larger fraction of the neural elements 
remain, on average, near threshold.

4 SIMULATION RESULTS 
A network consisting of N = 50 neural elements was examined wherein p = 6 
memory patterns (A1, A2, A3, B1, B2 and B3) were chosen at random 
(PIN = 0.12). These memories were arranged into two loops, A and B, accord- 
ing to equation (2) such that the cyclic sequences A1 -- A2 --* A3 -- A1 -- ... and 
B1  B2 -- B3 -- B1 --+ ... were stored in loops A and B, respectively. For sim- 
plicity, 5(t) = (t) and Oi(t) = 0, Vi. The transition parameters were set to ) = 2.5 
and r = 8 for all the simulations to ensure reliable pattern generation under fully 
modulated conditions (large/3, 6 = 0; Somplinsky and Kanter, 198(). Variations in 
/3, 6(t) and Ii(t) delineated the individual states that were examined. 
In the model wake state, where there was a high degree of aminergic-like modulation 
(e#./3 = 2.0), the network generated loops of sequential memories. Once cued into 
one of the two loops, the network would remain in that loop until an external input 
caused a transition into the other loop (figure 3).

network and loop B ensues. T
