ABSTRACT 
This paper introduces a means to handle the critical problem of non- 
local role-bindings in 1ocalist spreading-activation networks. Every 
conceptual node in the network broadcasts a stable, uniquely-identifying 
activation pattern, called its signature. A dynamic role-binding is cre- 
ated when a role's binding node has an activation that matches the 
bound concept's signature. Most importantly, signatures are propagated 
across long paths of nodes to handle the non-local role-bindings neces- 
sary for inferencing. Our 1ocalist network model, ROBIN (ROle 
Binding and Inferencing Network), uses signature activations to ro- 
bustly represent schemata role-bindings and thus perform the inferenc- 
ing, plan/goal analysis, schema instantiation, word-sense disambigua- 
tion, and dynamic re-interpretation portions of the natural language un- 
derstanding process. 
MOTIVATION 
Understanding natural language is a difficult task, often requiring a reader to make multi- 
ple inferences to understand the motives of actors and to connect actions that are unrelated 
on the basis of surface semantics alone. An example of this is the sentence: 
S 1: John put the pot inside the dishwasher because the police were coming. 
A complex plan/goal analysis of S 1 must be made to understand the actors' actions and 
disambiguate pot to MARIJUANA by overriding the local context of dishwasher.

DISTRIBUTED SPREADING-ACTIVATION NETWORKS 
Distributed connectionist models, such as [McClelland and Kawamoto, 1986] and 
[Touretzky and Hinton, 1985], are receiving much interest because their models are closer 
to the neural level than symbolic systems, such as [Dyer, 1983]. Despite this attention, 
no distributed network has yet exhibited the ability to handle natural language input hav- 
ing complexity even near to that of S 1. The primary reason for this current lack of 
success is the inability to perform dynamic role-bindings and to propagate these binding 
constraints during inferencing. Distributed networks, furthermore, are sequential at the 
knowledge level and lack the representation of structure needed to handle complex 
conceptual relationships [Feldman, 1986]. 
LOCALIST SPREADING-ACTIVATION NETWORKS 
Localist spreading-activation networks, such as [Cottrell and Small, 1983] and [Waltz and 
Pollack, 1985], also seem more neurally plausible than symbolic logic/Lisp-based sys- 
tems. Knowledge is represented in 1ocalist networks by simple computational nodes and 
their interconnections, with each node standing for a distinct concept. Activation on a 
conceptual node represents the amount of evidence available for that concept in the current 
context. 
Unlike distributed networks, localist networks are parallel at the knowledge level and are 
able to represent structural relationships between concepts. Because of this, many differ- 
ent inference paths can be pursued simultaneously; a necessity if the quick responses that 
people are able to generate is to be modelled. 
Unfortunately, however, the evidential activation on the conceptual nodes of previous lo- 
calist networks gives no clue as to where that evidence came from. Because of this, pre- 
vious 1ocalist models have been similar to distributed connectionist models in their in- 
ability to handle dynamic, non-local bindings -- and thus remain unsuited to higher-level 
knowledge tasks where inferencing is required. 
ROBIN 
Our research has resulted in ROBIN (ROle Binding and Inferencing Network), a localist 
spreading-activation model with additional structure to handle the dynamic role-bindings 
and inferencing needed for building in-depth representations of complex and ambiguous 
sentences, such as S 1. ROBIN's networks are built entirely with simple computational 
elements that clearly have the possibility of realization at the neural level. 
Figure 1 shows an overview of a semantic network embedded in ROBIN after input for 
sentence S 1 has been presented. The network has made the inferences necessary to form a 
plan/goal analysis of the actors' actions, with the role-bindings being instantiated 
dynamically with activation. The final interpretation selected is the most highly-activated 
path of frames inside the darkly shaded area. 
As in previous localist models, ROBIN's networks have a node for every known concept

Figure 1. Semantic network embedded in ROBIN, showing inferences 
dynamically made after S 1 is presented. Thickness of frame boundaries 
shows their amount of evidential activation. Darkly shaded area indicates 
the most highly-activated path of frames representing the most probable 
plan/goal analysis of the input. Dashed area shows discarded dishwasher- 
cleaning nterpretation. Frames outside of both areas show a small por- 
tion of the network that received no evidential or signature activation. 
Each frame is actually represented by the connectivity of a set of nodes. 
in the network. Relations between concepts are represented by weighted connections 
between their respective nodes. The activation of a conceptual node is evidential, 
548 Lange and Dyer 
corresponding to the amount of evidence available for the concept and the likelihood that 
it is selected in the current context. 
Simply representing the amount of evidence available for a concept, however, is not suf- 
ficient for complex language understanding tasks. Role-binding requires that some means 
exist for identifying a concept that is being dynamically bound to a role in distant areas of 
the network. A network may have never heard about JOHN having the goal of 
AVOID-DETECTION of his MARIJUANA, but it must be able to infer just such a 
possibility to understand S 1. 
SIGNATURE ACTIVATION IN ROBIN 
Every conceptual node in ROBIN's localist network has associated with it an identifica- 
tion node broadcasting a stable, uniquely-identifying activation pattern, called its 
signature. A dynamic binding is created when a role's binding node has an activation that 
matches the activation of the bound concept's signature node.

Figure 2. Several concepts and their uniquely-identifying signature nodes 
are shown, along with the Actor role of the TRANSFER-INSIDE frame. 
The dotted arrow from the binding node (black circle) to the signature node 
of JOHN represents the virtual binding indicated by the shared signature 
activation, and does not exist as an actual connection. 
In Figure 2, the virtual binding of the Actor role node of action TRANSFER-INSIDE to 
JOHN is represented by the fact that its binding node, the solid black circle, has the same 
activation (3.1) as JOHN's signature node. 
PROPAGATION OF SIGNATURES FOR ROLE-BINDING 
The most important feature of ROBIN's signature activations is that the model passes 
them, as activation, across long paths of nodes to handle the non-local role-bindings nee- 
essary for inferencing. Figure 3 illustrates how the structure of the network automatically 
accomplishes this in a ROBIN network segment that implements a portion of the 
semantic network of Figure 1.

Figure 3. Simplified ROBIN network segment showing parallel paths 
over which evidential activation Coottom plane) and signature activation 
(top plane) are spread for inferencing. Signature nodes (rectangles) and 
binding nodes (solid black circles) are in the top plane. Thickness of 
conceptual node boundaries (ovals) represents their level of evidential 
activation after quiescence has been reached for sentence S 1. (The names 
on the nodes are not used by ROBIN in any way, being used simply to set 
up the network's structure initially and to aid in analysis.) 
Evidential activation is spread through the paths between conceptual nodes on the bottom 
plane (i.e. TRANSFER-INSIDE and its Object role), while signature activation for dynamic 
role-bindings is spread across the parallel paths of corresponding binding nodes on the top 
plane. Nodes and connections for the Actor, Planner, and Location roles are not shown. 
Initially there is no activation on any of the conceptual or binding nbdes in the network. 
When input for S 1 is presented, the concept TRANSFER-INSIDE receives evidential acti- 
vation from the phrase Joh
