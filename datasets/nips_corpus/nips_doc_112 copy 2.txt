ABSTRACT 
This report describes the design of a programmable general 
purpose analog neural computer and simulator. It is intended primarily 
for real-word real-time computations such as analysis of visual or 
acoustical patterns, robotics and the development of special purpose 
neural nets. The machine is scalable and composed of interconnected 
modules containing arrays of neurons, modifiable synapses and switches. 
It runs entirely in analog mode but connection architecture, synaptic 
gains and time constants as well as neuron parameters are set digitally. 
Each neuron has a limited number of inputs and can be connected to any 
but not all other neurons. For the determination of synaptic gains and the 
implementation of learning algorithms the neuron outputs are 
multiplexer, A/D converted and stored in digital memory. Even at 
moderate size of 10  to l0 s neurons computational speed is expected to 
exceed that of any current digital computer. 
OVERVIEW 
The machine described in this paper is intended to serve as a general purpose 
programmable neuron analog computer and simulator. Its architecture is loosely based on 
the cerebral cortex in the sense that there are separate neurons, axons and synapses and that 
each neuron can receive only a limited number of inputs. However, in contrast to the 
biological system, the connections can be modified by external control permitting 
exploration of different architectures in addition to adjustment of synaptic weights and 
neuron parameters. 
The general architecture of the computer is shown in Fig. 1. The machine contains 
large numbers of the following separate elements: neurons, synapses, routing switches 
and connection lines. Arrays of these elements are fabricated on VLSI chips which are 
mounted on planar chip carriers each of which forms a separate module. These modules 
are connected directly to neighboring modules. Neuron arrays are arranged in rows and 
columns and are surrounded by synaptic and axon arrays.

The machine runs entirely in analog mode. However, connection architectures, 
synaptic gains and neuron parameters such as thresholds and time constants are set by a 
digital computer. For determining synaptic weights in a learning mode, time segments of 
the outputs from neurons are multiplexed, digitized and stored in digital memory. 
The modular design allows expansion to any degree and at moderate to large size, 
i.e. 103 to 105 neurons, operational speed would exceed that of any currently available 
digital computer.

Figure 1. Layout and general architecture. The machine is composed of different 
modules shown here as squares. Each module contains on a VLSI chip an array of 
components (neurons, synapses or switches) and their control circuits. Our prototype 
design calls for 50 neuron modules for a total of 800 neurons each having 64 synapses. 
The insert shows the direction of data flow through the modules. Outputs from 
each neuron leave north and south and are routed through the switch modules east and west 
and into the synapse modules from north and south. They can also bypass the synapse 
modules north and south. Input to the neurons through the synapses is from east and west. 
Power and digital control lines run north and south. 
THE NEURON MODULES 
Each neuron chip contains 16 neurons, an analog multiplexer and control logic. 
(See Figs. 2 & 3.) 
Input-output relations of the neurons are idealized versions of a typical biological 
neuron. Each unit has an adjustable threshold (bias), an adjustable minimum output value 
at threshold and a maximum output (See Fig. 4). Output time constants are selected on the 
switch chips. The neuron is based on an earlier design which used discrete components 
(Mueller and Lazzaro, 1986). 
714 Mueller, et al 
Inputs to each neuron come from synapse chips east and west (SIR, SIL), outputs 
(NO) go to switch chips north and south. Each neuron has a second input that sets the 
minimum output at threshold which is common for all neurons on the chip and selected 
through a separate synapse line. The threshold is set from one of the synapses connected 
to a fixed voltage. An analog multiplexer provides neuron output to a common line, OM, 
which connects to an A/D converter.

Each unit has an adjustable threshold, Vwhich was set here to 1.5V, a linear transfer 
region above threshold, an adjustable minimum output at threshold E set to 1V and a 
maximum output, 
THE SYNAPSE MODULES 
Each synapse chip contains a 32 * 16 array of synapses. The synaptic gain of each 
synapse is setby serial input from the computer and is storedat each synapse. Dynamic range 
of the synapse gains covers the range from 0 to 10 with 5 bit resolution, a six th bit determines 
the sign. The gains are implemented by current mirrors which scale the neuron output after 
it has been converted from a voltage to a current. 
The modifiable synapse designs reported in the literature use either analog or 
digital signals to set the gains (Schwartz, et. al., 1989, Raffel, et. al, 1987, Alspector and 
Allen, 1987). We chose the latter method because of its greater reproducibility and because 
direct analog setting of the gains from the neuron outputs would require a prior knowledge 
of and commitment to a particular learning algorithm. Layout and performance of the 
synapse module are shown in Figs. 5-7. As seen in Fig. 7a, the synaptic transfer function 
is linear from 0 to 4 V. 
The use of current mirrors permits arbitrary scaling of the synaptic gains (weights) 
with trade off between range and resolution limited to 5 bits. Our current design calls for 
a minimum gain of 1/32 and a maximum of 10. The lower end of the dynamic range is 
determined by the number of possible inputs per neuron which when active should not drive 
the neuron output to its limit, whereas the high gain values are needed in situations where 
a single or very few synapses must be effective such as in the copying of activity from one 
neuron to another or for veto inhibition. The digital nature of the synaptic gain control does 
not allow straight forward implementation of a logarithmic gain scale. Fig. 7b. shows two 
possible relations between digital code and synaptic gain. In one case the total gain is the 
sum of 5 individual gains each controlled by one bit. This leads inevitably to jumps in the 
gain curve. In a second case a linear 3 bit gain is multiplied by four different constants 
716 Mueller, et al 
controlled by the 4th and 5th bit. This scheme affords a better approximation to a 
logarithmic scale. So far we have implemented only the first scheme. 
Although the resolution of an individual synapse is limited to 5 bits, several 
synapses driven by one neuron can be combined through switching, permitting greater 
resolution and dynamic range.

DATA 
Figure 5. Diagram of the synapse module. Each synapse gain is set by a 5 bit word 
stored in local memory. The memory is implemented as a quasi dynamic shift register 
that reads the gain data during the programming phase. Voltage to current converters 
transform the neuron output (NI) into a current. I Conv are current mirrors that scale 
the currents with 5 bit resolution. The weighted currents are summed on a common 
line to the neuron input (SO).

THE SWITCH MODULES 
The switch modules serve to route the signals between neurons and allow changes 
to the connection architecture. Each module contains a 32*32 cross point array of analog 
switches which are set by serial digital input. There is also a set of serial switches that can 
disconnect input andoutput lines. In addition to switches the modules contain circuits which 
control the time constants of the synapse transfer function (see Figs. 8 & 9). The switch 
performance is summarized in Table 1.
