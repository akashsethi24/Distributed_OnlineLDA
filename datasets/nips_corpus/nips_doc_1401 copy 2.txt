Abstract 
An asynchronous PDM (Pulse-Density-Modulating) digital neural 
network system has been developed in our laboratory. It consists 
of one thousand neurons that are physically interconnected via one 
million 7-bit synapses. It can solve one thousand simultaneous 
nonlinear first-order differential equations in a fully parallel and 
continuous fashion. The performance of this system was measured 
by a winner-take-all network with one thousand neurons. Although 
the magnitude of the input and network parameters were identi- 
cal for each competing neuron, one of them won in 6 milliseconds. 
This processing speed amounts to 360 billion connections per sec- 
ond. A broad range of neural networks including spatiotemporal 
filtering, feedforward, and feedback networks can be run by loading 
appropriate network parameters from a host system. 
I INTRODUCTION 
The hardware implementation of neural networks is crucial in order to realize the 
real-time operation of neural functions such as spatiotemporal filtering, learning 
and constraint processings. Since the mid eighties, many VLSI chips and systems 
have been reported in the literature, e.g. [1] [2]. Most of the chips and the systems 
including analog and digital implementations, however, have focused on feedforward 
neural networks. Little attention has been paid to the dynamical aspect of feed- 
back neural networks, which is especially important in order to realize constraint 
processings, e.g. [3]. Although there were a small number of exceptions that used 
analog circuits [4] [5], their network sizes were limited as compared to those of their 
feedforward counterparts because of wiring problems that are inevitable in regard 
to full and physical interconnections. To relax this problem, a pulse-stream system 
has been used in analog [6] and digital implementations [7].

The author developed a fully interconnected 54-neuron system that uses an asyn- 
chronous PDM (Pulse-Density-Modulating) digital circuit system [8]. The present 
paper describes a thousand-neuron system in which all of the neurons are physi- 
cally interconnected via one million 7-bit synapses in order to create a fully parallel 
feedback system. The outline of this project was described in [10]. In addition to 
the enlargement of system size, synapse circuits were improved and time constant 
of each neuron was made variable. The PDM system was used because it can ac- 
complish faithful analog data transmission between neurons and can relax wiring 
problems. An asynchronous digital circuit was used because it can solve scaling 
problems, and we could also use it to connect more than one thousand VLSI chips, 
as described below. 
2 NEURON MODEL AND THE CIRCUITS 
2.1 SINGLE NEURON MODEL 
The behavior of each neuron in the system can be described by the following non- 
linear first-order differential equation: 
dy?(t) v 
Y' dt = -y'(t) +  wijyj(t) + Ii(t), (1) 
j--1 
yi(t) = T[y;(t)], and (2) 
 a ifad0 
T[a] = 0 otherse, (3) 
where Yi is  time constant of the i-th neuron, y(t) is  intern potenti of the 
i-th neuron at time t, wij is  synaptic weight from the j-th to the i-th neurons, 
and L(t) is an externM input to the i-th neuron. T[a] is  analog threshold output 
function which becomes saturated at a ven mmum vue. 
The system solves Eq.(1) in the following integrM form: 
*  * T dT '0 
y,(t)= , +y,( ), (4) 
j=l 
where y(0) is an itiM vMue. An anog output of a neuron is expressed by a 
pulse stream whose kequency is propoion to the positive, instanteous intern 
potentiM. 
2.2 SINGLE NEURON CIRCUIT 
2.2.1 Synapse circuits 
The circuit diagrams for a single neuron are shown in Fig. 1. As shown in Fig.l(a), 
it consists of synapse circuits, excitatory and inhibitory dendrite OR circuits, and 
a cell body circuit. Each synapse circuit transforms the instantaneous frequency of 
the iput pulses to a frequency that is proportional to the synaptic weight. This 
transformation is carried out by a 6-bit rate multiplier, as shown in Fig. l(b). The 
behavior of a rate multiplier is illustrated in Fig. l(c) using a 3-bit case for brevity. 
A rate multiplier is a counter and its state transits to the next state when an input 
pulse occurs. Each binary bit of a given weight specifies at which states the output 
pulses are generated. When the LSB is on, an output pulse is generated at the 
fourth state. When the second bit is on, output pulses are generated at the second

and at the sixth states. When the MSB is on, they are generated at all of the odd 
states. Therefore, the magnitude of synaptic weight that can be represented by 
a rate multiplier is less than one. In our circuit, this limitation was overcome by 
increasing the frequency of a neuron output by a factor of two, as described below. 
2.2.2 Dendrite circuits 
Output pulses from a synapse circuit are fed either to an excitatory dendrite OR cir- 
cuit or to an inhibitory one, according to the synaptic weight sign. In each dendrite 
OR circuit, the synaptic output pulses are summed by OR gates, as is shown along 
the right side of Fig. l(a). Therefore, if these output pulses are synchronized, they 
are counted as one pulse and linear summation cannot take place. In our circuit, 
each neuron is driven by an individual clock oscillator. Therefore, they will tend to 
become desynchronized. The summation characteristic was analysed in [9], and it 
was shown to have a saturation characteristic that is similar to the positive part of 
a hyperbolic tangent function. 
2.2.3 Cell body circuit 
A cell body circuit performs the integration given by Eq.(4) as follows. As shown 
in Fig. l(d), integration was performed by a 12-bit up-down counter. Input pulses 
from an excitatory dendrite OR circuit are fed into the up-input of the counter and 
those from an inhibitory one are fed into the down-input after conflicts between 
708 Y.. Hirai 
excitatory and inhibitory pulses have been resolved by a sampling circuit. A 12-bit 
rate multiplier produces internal pulses whose frequency is 2f, where f is propor- 
tional to the absolute value of the counter. The rate multiplier is driven by a main 
clock whose frequency is 4fmx, fmx being the maximum output frequency. When 
the counter value is positive, an output pulse train whose frequency is either f or 
2f, according to the scale factor is transmitted from a cell body circuit. 
The negative feedback term that appeared in the integrand of Eq.(4) can be realized 
by feeding the internal pulses into the down-input of the counter when the counter 
value is positive and feeding them into the up-input when it is negative. The 6- 
bit rate multiplier inserted in this feedback path changes the time constant of a 
neuron. Let/3i be the rate value of the rate multiplier, where 0 < /6i < 26. The 
Eq. (4) becomes: 
y(t) = y(r) + j=l wijyj(r) +Ii(r) dr . 
-Yi ( ) + - wijyi(r) + Ii(r) t-75r + Yi (0). 
j--1 
(5) 
 21  
Therefore, the time constant changes to , where/i was given by fm---- seconds. 
It should be noted that, since the magnitude of the total input was increased by a 
factor of 7' the strength of the input should be decreased by the inverse of that 
factor in order to maintain an appropriate output level. If it is not adjusted, we 
can increase the input strength. Therefore, the system has both input and output 
scaling functions. The time constant varies from about 416/sec for fl = 63 to 
26.2msec for fl = 1. When fl - 0, the negative feedback path is interrupted and 
the circuit operates as a simple integrator, and every feedforward network can be 
run in this mode of operation. 
3 THE 1,000-NEURON SYSTEM 
3.1 VLSI CHIP 
A single type of VLSI chip was fabricated using a 0.7ttm CMOS gate array with 
250,000 gates. A single chip contains 18 neurons and 51 synapses for each neuron. 
Therefore, each chip has a total of 918 synapses. About 85% of the gates in a gate 
array could be used, which was an extremely efficient value. A chip was mounted 
on a fiat package with 256 pins. Among them, 216 pins were used for signals and 
the others were used for twenty pairs of Vcc(=3.3V) and GND. 
3.2 THE SYSTEM 
As illustrated in Fig.2(a), this system consists of 56 x 20 = 1,120 chips. 56 chips 
are used for both cell bodies and synapses, and the others are used to extend 
dendrite circuits and increase the number of synapses. In order to extend the 
dendrites, the dendrite signals in a chip can be directly transmitted to the dendrite 
extention terminals of another chip by bypassing the cell body circuits. There are 
51 x 20 = 1,020 synapses per neuron. Among them, 1,008 synapses are used for fully 
hard-wired interconnections and the other 12 synapses are used to receive external 
signals. There are a total of 1,028,160 synapses in this system. It is controlled by 
a personal computer. The synaptic weights, the contents of the up
