ABSTRACT 
Most complex behaviors appear to be governed by internal moti- 
vational states or drives that modify an animal's responses to its 
environment. It is therefore of considerable interest to understand 
the neural basis of these motivational states. Drawing upon work 
on the neural basis of feeding in the marine mollusc Aplysia, we 
have developed a heterogeneous artificial neural network for con- 
trolling the feeding behavior of a simulated insect. We demonstrate 
that feeding in this artificial insect shares many characteristics with 
the motivated behavior of natural animals. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
While an animal's external environment certainly plays an extremely important role 
in shaping its actions, the behavior of even simpler animals is by no means solely 
reactive. The response of an animal to food, for example, cannot be explained only 
in terms of the physical stimuli involved. On two different occasions, the very same 
animal may behave in completely different ways when presented with seemingly 
identical pieces of food (e.g. hungrily consuming it in one case and ignoring or 
even avoiding it in another). To account for these differences, behavioral scientists 
hypothesize internal motivational states or drives which modulate an animal's re- 
sponse to its environment. These internal factors play a particularly important role 
in complex behavior, but are present to some degree in nearly all animal behav- 
ior. Behaviors which exhibit an extensive dependence on motivational variables are 
termed motivated behaviors.

While a rigorous definition is difficult to state, behaviors spoken of as motivated gen- 
erally exhibit some subset of the following six characteristics (Kupfermann, 1974): 
(1) grouping and sequencing of component behaviors in time, (2) goal-directedness: 
the sequence of component behaviors generated can often be understood only by ref- 
erence to some internal goal, (3) spontaneity: the behavior can occur in the absence 
of any recognizable eliciting stimuli, (4) changes in responsiveness: the effect of a 
motivational state varies depending upon an animal's level of arousal, (5) persis- 
tence: the behavior can greatly outlast any initiating stimulus, and (6) associative 
learning. 
Motivational states are pervasive in mammalian behavior. However, they have 
also proven to be essential for explaining the behavior of simpler animals as well. 
Unfortunately, the explanatory utility of these internal factors is limited by the fact 
that they are hypothetical constructs, inferred by the theorist to intervene between 
stimulus and action in order to account for otherwise inexplicable responses. What 
might be the neural basis of these motivational states? 
In order to explore this question, we have drawn upon work on the neural basis 
of feeding in the marine mollusc Aplysia to implement feeding in a simulated in- 
sect. Feeding is a prototypical motivated behavior in which attainment of the goal 
object (food) is clearly crucial to an animal's survival. In this case, the relevant 
motivational state is hunger. When an animal is hungry, it will exhibit a sequence 
of appetitive behaviors which serve to identify and properly orient the animal to 
food. Once food is available, consummatory behaviors are generated to ingest it. 
On the other hand, a satiated animal may ignore or even avoid sensory stimuli 
which suggest the presence of food (Kupfermann, 1974). 
This effort is part of a larger project aimed at designing artificial nervous systems 
for the flexible control of complete autonomous agents (Beer, 1989). In addition 
to feeding, this artificial insect is currently capable of locomotion (Beer, Chiel, and 
Sterling, 1989; Chiel and Beer, 1989), wandering, and edge-following, and possesses 
a simple behavioral hierarchy as well. A central theme of this work has been the 
utilization of biologically-inspired architectures in our neural network designs. To 
support this capability, we make use of model neurons which capture some of the 
intrinsic properties of nerve cells. 
The simulated insect and the environment in which it exists is designed as fol- 
lows. The insect has six legs, and is capable of statically stable locomotion and 
turning. Its head contains a mouth which can open and close, and its mouth and 
two antennae possess tactile and chemical sensors. The insect possesses an internal 
energy supply which is depleted at a fixed rate. The simulated environment also 
contains unmovable obstacles and circular food patches. The food patches emit an 
odor whose intensity is proportional to the size of the patch. As this odor diffuses 
through the environment, its intensity falls off as the inverse square of the distance 
from the center of the patch. Whenever the insect's mouth closes over a patch of 
food, a fixed amount of energy is transferred from the patch to the insect.

2 APPETITIVE COMPONENT 
The appetitive component of feeding is responsible for getting a hungry insect to a 
food patch. To accomplish this task, it utilizes the locomotion, wandering, and edge- 
following capabilities of the insect. The interactions between the neural circuitry 
underlying these behaviors and the feeding controller presented in this paper are 
described elsewhere (Beer, 1989). Assuming that the insect is already close enough 
to a food patch that the chemical sensors in its antennae can detect an odor signal, 
there are two separate issues which must be addressed by this phase of the behavior. 
First, the insect must use the information from the chemical sensors in its antennae 
to turn itself toward the food patch as it walks. Second, this orientation should only 
occur when the insect is actually in need of energy. Correspondingly, the appetitive 
neural controller (Figure 1) consists of two distinct components. 
The orientation component is comprised of the upper six neurons in Figure 1. The 
odor signals detected by the chemical sensors in each antenna (ACS) are compared 
(by LOS and ROS), and the difference between them is used to generate a turn 
toward the stronger side by exciting the corresponding turn interneuron (LT or RT) 
by an amount proportional to the size of the difference. These turn interneurons 
connect to the motor neurons controlling the lateral extension of each front leg. 
The second component is responsible for controlling whether or not the insect ac-

tually orients to a nearby patch of food. This decision depends upon its internal 
energy level, and is controlled by the bottom three neurons in Figure 1. Though the 
odor gradient is continuously being sensed, the connections to the turn interneurons 
are normally disabled, preventing access of this information to the motor appara- 
tus which turns the insect. As the insect's energy level falls, however, so does the 
activity of its energy sensor (ES). This decreasing activity gradually releases the 
spontaneously active feeding arousal neuron (FA) from inhibition. When activity 
in FA becomes sufficient to fire the search command neuron (SC), the connections 
between the odor strength neurons and the turn neurons are enabled by gating 
connections from SC, and the insect begins to orient to food. 
3 CONSUMMATORY COMPONENT 
Once the appetitive controller has successfully oriented the insect to food, the con- 
summatory component of the behavior is triggered. This phase consists of rhythmic 
biting movements which persist until sufficient food has been ingested. Like the ap- 
petitive phase, consummatory behavior should only be released when the insect is 
in need of energy. In addition, an animal's interest in feeding (its feeding arousal, 
may be a function of more than just its energy requirements. Other factors, such as 
the exposure of an animal to the taste, odor, or tactile sensations of food, can signif- 
icantly increase its feeding arousal. This relationship between feeding and arousal, 
in which the very act of feeding further enhances an animal's interest in feeding, 
leads to a form of behavioral hysteresis. Once food is encountered, an animal may 
feed well beyond the internal energy requirements which initiated the behavior. In 
many animals, this hysteresis is thought to play a role in the patterning of feeding 
behavior into discrete meals rather than continuous grazing (Susswein, Weiss, and 
Kupfermann, 1978). At some point, of course, the ingested food must be capable 
of overriding the arousing effects of consummatory behavior, or the animal would 
never cease to feed. 
The neural controller for the consummatory phase of feeding is shown in Figure 
2. When chemical (MCS) and tactile (MTS) sensors in the mouth signal that 
food is present (FP), and the insect is sufficiently aroused to feeding (FA), the 
consummatory command neuron (CC) fires. The conjunction of tactile and chemical 
signals is required in order to prevent attempts to ingest nonfood patches and, due 
to the diffusion of odors, to prevent biting from beginning before the food patch 
is actually reached. Once CC fires, it triggers the bite pacemaker neuron (BP) 
to generate rhythmic bursts which cause a motor neuron (MO) to open and close 
the mouth. Because the threshold of the consummatory command neuron (CC) is 
somewhat lower than that of the search comma
