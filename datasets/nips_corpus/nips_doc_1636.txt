Abstract 
I consider a topographic projection between two neuronal layers with dif- 
ferent densities of neurons. Given the number of output neurons con- 
nected to each input neuron (divergence or fan-out) and the number of 
input neurons synapsing on each output neuron (convergence or fan-in) I 
determine the widths of axonal and dendritic arbors which minimize the 
total volume of axons and dendrites. My analytical results can be sum- 
marized qualitatively in the following rule: neurons of the sparser layer 
should have arbors wider than those of the denser layer. This agrees with 
the anatomical data from retinal and cerebellar neurons whose morphol- 
ogy and connectivity are known. The rule may be used to infer connec- 
tivity of neurons from their morphology. 
1 Introduction 
Understanding brain function requires knowing connections between neurons. However, 
experimental studies of inter-neuronal connectivity are difficult and the connectivity data 
is scarce. At the same time neuroanatomists possess much data on cellular morphology 
and have powerful techniques to image neuronal shapes. This suggests using morphologi- 
cal data to infer inter-neuronal connections. Such inference must rely on rules which relate 
shapes of neurons to their connectivity. 
The purpose of this paper is to derive such rule for a frequently encountered feature in the 
brain organization: a topographic projection. Two layers of neurons are said to form a topo- 
graphic projection if adjacent neurons of the input layer connect to adjacent neurons of the 
output layer, Figure 1. As a result, output neurons form an orderly map of the input layer. 
I characterize inter-neuronal connectivity for a topographic projection by divergence and 
convergence factors defined as follows, Figure 1. Divergence, D, of the projection is the 
number of output neurons which receive connections from an input neuron. Convergence, 
IY, of the projection is the number of input neurons which connect with an output neuron. I 
assume that these numbers are the same for each neuron in a given layer. Furthermore, each 
neuron makes the required connections with the nearest neurons of the other layer. In most 
cases, this completely specifies the wiring diagram. 
A typical topographic wiring diagram shown in Figure 1 misses an important biological de- 
tail. In real brains, connections between cell bodies are implemented by neuronal processes: 
axons which carry nerve pulses away from the cell bodies and dendrites which carry signals

towards cell bodies.[ 1] Therefore each connection is interrupted by a synapse which sepa- 
rates an axon of one neuron from a dendrite of another. Both axons and dendrites branch 
away from cell bodies forming arbors. 
In general, a topographic projection with given divergence and convergence may be imple- 
mented by axonal and dendritic arbors of different sizes, which depend on the locations of 
synapses. For example, consider a wiring diagram with D = 1 and C' = 6, Figure 2a. Nar- 
row axonal arbors may synapse onto wide dendritic arbors, Figure 2b or wide axonal arbors 
may synapse onto narrow dendritic arbors, Figure 2c. I call these arrangements type I and 
type II, correspondingly. The question is: which arbor sizes are preferred? 
I propose a rule which specifies the sizes of axonal arbors of input neurons and dendritic 
arbors of output neurons in a topographic projection: High divergence/convergence ratio 
favors wide axonal and narrow dendritic arbors while low divergence/convergence ratio 
favors narrow axonal arbors and wide dendritic arbors. Alternatively, this rule may be for- 
mulated in terms of neuronal densities in the two layers: Sparser layer has wider arbors. 
In the above example, divergence/convergence (and neuronal density) ratio is 1/6 and, ac- 
cording to the rule, type I arrangement, Figure 2b, is preferred. 
In this paper I derive a quantitative version of this rule from the principle of wiring economy 
which can be summarized as follows. [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] Space constraints require keeping the 
brain volume to a minimum. Because wiring (axons and dendrites) takes up a significant 
fraction of the volume, evolution has probably designed axonal and dendritic arbors in a 
way that minimizes their total volume. Therefore we may understand the existing arbor 
sizes as a result of wiring optimization.

To obtain the rule I formulate and solve a wiring optimization problem. The goal is to find 
the sizes of axons and dendrites which minimize the total volume of wiring in a topographic 
wiring diagram for fixed locations of neurons. I specify the wiring diagram with divergence 
and convergence factors. Throughout most of the paper I assume that the cross-sectional 
area of dendrites and axons are constant and equal. Therefore, the problem reduces to the 
wire length minimization. Extension to unequal fiber diameters is given below. 
2 Topographic projection in two dimensions 
Consider two parallel layers of neurons with densities n and n2. The topographic wiring 
diagram has divergence and convergence factors, D and 6', requiring each input neuron to 
connect with D nearest output neurons and each output neuron with 6' nearest input neurons. 
Again, the problem is to find the arrangement of arbors which minimizes the total length of 
axons and dendrites. For different arrangements I compare the wirelength per unit area, L. I 
assume that the two layers are close to each other and include only those parts of the wiring 
which are parallel to the layers. 
I start with a special case where each input neuron connects with only one output neuron 
(D = 1). Consider an example with 6' = 16 and neurons arranged on a square grid in 
each layer, Figure 3a. Two extreme arrangements satisfy the wiring diagram: type I has 
wide dendritic arbors and no axonal arbors, Figure 3b; type II has wide axonal arbors and 
no dendritic arbors, Figure 3c. I take the branching angles equal to 120 ï¿½, an optimal value 
for constant crossectional area.[4] Assuming point neurons the ratio of wirelength for type 
I and type II arrangements:

Thus, the type I arrangement with wide dendritic arbors has shorter wire length. This con- 
clusion holds for other convergence values much greater than one, provided D -- 1. How- 
ever, there are other arrangements with non-zero axonal arbors that give the same wire 
length. One of them is shown in Figure 3d. Degenerate arrangements have axonal arbor 
width 0 < sa < 1/f' where the upper bound is given by the approximate inter-neuronal 
distance. This means that the optimal arbor size ratio for D = 1

By using the symmetry in respect to the direction of signal propagation I adapt this result 
for the 6' = 1 case. For D > 1, arrangements with wide axonal arbors and narrow dendritic 
arbors (0 < sa < 1/x/h--) have minimal wirelength. The arbor size ratio is

Next, I consider the case when both divergence and convergence are greater than one. 
Due to complexity of the problem I study the limit of large divergence and convergence 
(D, 6' >> 1). I find analytically the optimal layout which minimizes the total length of ax- 
ons and dendrites. 
Notice that two neurons may form a synapse only if the axonal arbor of the input neuron 
overlaps with the dendritic arbor of the output neuron in a two-dimensional projection, Fig- 
ure 4. Thus the goal is to design optimal dendritic and axonal arbors so that each dendritic 
arbor intersects 6' axonal arbors and each axonal arbor intersects D dendritic arbors. 
To be specific, I consider a wiring diagram with convergence exceeding divergence, 6' > D 
(the argument can be readily adapted for the opposite case). I make an assumption, to be

few are shown. The number of input neurons is greater than the number of output neurons

all the input neurons spanned by the dendritic arbor have to be connected.
