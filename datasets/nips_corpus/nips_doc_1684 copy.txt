Abstract 
Three contributions to developing an algorithm for assisting engi- 
neers in designing analog circuits are provided in this paper. First, 
a method for representing highly nonlinear and non-continuous 
analog circuits using Kirchoff current law potential functions within 
the context of a Markov field is described. Second, a relatively effi- 
cient algorithm for optimizing the Markov field objective function 
is briefly described and the convergence proof is briefly sketched. 
And third, empirical results illustrating the strengths and limita- 
tions of the approach are provided within the context of a JFET 
transistor design problem. The proposed algorithm generated a set 
of circuit components for the JFET circuit model that accurately 
generated the desired characteristic curves. 
1 Analog circuit design using Markov random fields 
1.1 Markov random field models 
A Markov random field (MRF) is a generalization of the concept of a Markov chain. 
In a Markov field one begins with a set of random variables and a neighborhood re- 
lation which is represented by a graph. Each random variable will be assumed in 
this paper to be a discrete random variable which takes on one of a finite number 
of possible values. Each node of the graph indexs a specific random variable. A 
link from the jth node to the ith node indicates that the conditional probability 
distribution of the ith random variable in the field is functionally dependent upon 
the jth random variable. That is, random variable j is a neighbor of random vari- 
able i. The only restriction upon the definition of a Markov field (i.e., the positivity 
condition) is that the probability of every realization of the field is strictly posi- 
tive. The essential idea behind Markov field design is that one specifies a potential 
(energy) function for every clique in the neighborhood graph such that the subset 
of random variables associated with that clique obtain their optimal values when 
that clique's potential function obtains its minimal value (for reviews see [1]-[2]).

Markov random field models provide a convenient mechanism for probabilistically 
representing and optimally combining combinations of local constraints. 
1.2 Analog circuit design using SPICE 
In some mixed signal ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) design prob- 
lems, most of the circuit design specifications are well known but the introduction 
of a single constraint (e.g., an increase in substrate noise) could result in a major 
redesign of an entire circuit. The industry standard tool for aiding engineers in 
solving analog circuit design problems is SPICE which is a software environment 
for simulation of large scale electronic circuits. SPICE does have special optimiza- 
tion options for fitting circuit parameters to desired input-output characteristics 
but typically such constraints are too weak for SPICE to solve analog circuit de- 
sign problems with large numbers of free parameters (see [3] for an introduction to 
SPICE). Another difficulty with using SPICE is that it does not provide a global 
confidence factor for indicating its confidence in a generated design or local confi- 
dence factors for determining the locations of weak points in the automatically 
generated circuit design solution. 
1.3 Markov field approaches to analog circuit design 
In this paper, an approach for solving real-world analog circuit design problems us- 
ing an appropriately constructed Markov random is proposed which will be referred 
to as MRFSPICE. Not only are desired input-output characteristics directly incor- 
porated into the construction of the potential functions for the Markov field but 
additional constraints based upon Kirchoff's current law are directly incorporated 
into the field. This approach thus differs from the classic SPICE methodology be- 
cause Kirchoff current law constraints are explicitly incorporated into an objective 
function which is minimized by the optimal design. This approach also differs 
from previous Markov field approaches (i.e., the Harmony neural network model 
[4] and the Brain-State-in-a-Box neural network model [5]) designed to qualita- 
tively model human understanding of electronic circuit behavior since those ap- 
proaches used pair-wise correlational (quadratic) potential functions as opposed to 
the highly nonlinear potential functions that will be used in the approach described 
in this paper. 
1.4 Key contributions 
This paper thus makes three important contributions to the application of Markov 
random fields to the analog circuit design problem. First, a method for represent- 
ing highly nonlinear and non-continuous analog circuits using Kirchoff current law 
potential functions within the context of a Markov field is described. Second, a 
relatively efficient algorithm for optimizing the Markov field objective function is 
briefly described and the convergence proof is briefly sketched. And third, empirical 
results illustrating the strengths and limitations of the approach is provided within 
the context of a JFET transistor design problem. 
2 Modeling assumptions and algorithms 
2.1 Probabilistic modeling assumptions 
A given circuit circuit design problem consists of a number of design decision vari- 
ables. Denote those design decision variables by the discrete random variables

,...,d. Let the MRF be denoted by the set  = [,...,d] SO that a realiza- 
tion of i is the d-dimensional real vector x. A realization of i is referred to as a 
circuit design solution. 
Let the joint (global) probability mass function for  be denoted by PG. It is 
assumed that Pa (x) > Pa (Y) if and only if the circuit design solution x is preferred 
to the circuit design solution y. Thus, pG(x) specifies a type of probabilistic fuzzy 
measure [1]. 
For example, the random variable :i might refer to a design decision concerning 
the choice of a particular value for a capacitor C4. From previous experience, 
it is expected that the value of C4 may be usually constrained without serious 
difficulties to one of ten possible values: 
0.1tF, 0.2tF, 0.3tF, 0.4tF, 0.5tF, 0.6tF, 0.7pF, 0.8tF, 0.9tF, or ltF. 
Thus, ki = 10 in this example. By limiting the choice of C4 to a small number of 
finite values, this permits the introduction of design expertise hints directly into the 
problem formulation without making strong committments to the ultimate choice of 
the value of capacitor C4. Other examples of design decision variable Values include: 
resistor values, inductor values, transistor types, diode types, or even fundamentally 
different circuit topologies. 
The problem that is now considered will be to assign design preference probabilities 
in a meaningful way to alternative design solutions. The strategy for doing this will 
be based upon constructing Pa with the property that if Pa (x) > Pa (Y), then circuit 
design solution x exhibits the requisite operating characteristics with respect to a 
set of M test circuits more effectively than circuit design solution y. An optimal 
analog circuit design solution x* then may be defined as a global maximum of Pa. 
The specific details of this strategy for constructing pa are now discussed by first 
carefully defining the concept of a test circuit. 
Let � = {0, 1, 2,...,m} be a finite set of integers (i.e., the unique terminals in 
the test circuit) which index a set of rn complex numbers, v0, v, v2,..., vm which 
will be referred to as voltages. The magnitude of vk indicates the voltage magnitude 
while the angle of vk indicates the voltage phase shift. By convention the ground 
voltage, vo, is always assigned the value of 0. Let d  � x � (i.e., an ordered pair 
of elements in �). A circuit component current source is defined with respect to 
by a complex-valued function ia,b whose value is typically functionally dependent 
upon v and Vb but may also be functionally dependent upon other voltages and 
circuit component current sources associated with 
For example, a resistor circuit component current source would be modeled by 
choosing ia,b -' (Vb -- va)/R where R is the resistance in ohms of some resistor, Vb is 
the voltage observed on one terminal of the resistor, and va is the voltage observed 
on the other terminal of the resistor. The quantity ia,b is the current flowing through 
the resistor from terminal a to terminal b. Similarly, a capacitor circuit component 
current source would be modeled by choosing i,,b -- (Vb -- Va) / [2rj f] where j = vfL'-f 
and f is the frequency in Hz of the test circuit. A frequency specific voltage 
controlled current source circuit component current source may be modeled by 
making ia,b functionally dependent upon some subset of voltages in the test circuit. 
See [6] for additional details regarding the use of complex arithmetic for analog 
circuit analysis and design. 
An important design constraint is that Kirchoff's current law should be satisfied 
at every voltage node. Kirchoff's current law states that the sum of the currents 
entering a voltage node must be equal to zero [6]. We will now show how this 
physical law can be directly embodied as a system of nonlinear constraints on the

behavior of the MRF. 
We say that the kth voltage node in test circuit q is clamped if the voltage vk is 
known. For example, node k in circuit q might be directly grounded, node k might 
be directly connected to a grounded voltage source, or the voltage at node k, vk, 
might be a desired known target voltage. 
If voltage node k in test circuit q is clamped, then Kirchoff's current la
