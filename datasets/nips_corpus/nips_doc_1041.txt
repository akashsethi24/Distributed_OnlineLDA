Abstract 
A one dimensional model of primate smooth pursuit mechanism has 
been implemented in 2 tm CMOS VLSI. The model consolidates 
Robinson's negative feedback model with Wyatt and Pola's positive 
feedback scheme, to produce a smooth pursuit system which zero's the 
velocity of a target on the retina. Furthermore, the system uses the 
current eye motion as a predictor for future target motion. Analysis, 
stability and biological correspondence of the system are discussed. For 
implementation at the focal plane, a local correlation based visual 
motion detection technique is used. Velocity measurements, ranging 
over 4 orders of magnitude with < 15% variation, provides the input to 
the smooth pursuit system. The system performed successful velocity 
tracking for high contrast scenes. Circuit design and performance of the 
complete smooth pursuit system is presented. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
The smooth pursuit mechanism of primate visual systems is vital for stabilizing a region 
of the visual field on the retina. The ability to stabilize the image of the world on the 
retina has profound architectural and computational consequences on the retina and visual 
cortex, such as reducing the required size, computational speed and communication 
hardware and bandwidth of the visual system (Bandera, 1990; Eckert and Buchsbaum, 
1993). To obtain similar benefits in active machine vision, primate smooth pursuit can 
be a powerful model for gaze control. The mechanism for smooth pursuit in primates 
was initially believed to be composed of a simple negative feedback system which 
attempts to zero the motion of targets on the fovea, figure l(a) (Robinson, 1965). 
However, this scheme does not account for many psychophysical properties of smooth

pursuit, which led Wyatt and Pola (1979) to proposed figure l(b), where the eye 
movement signal is added to the target motion in a positive feed back loop. This 
mechanism results from their observation that eye motion or apparent target motion 
increases the magnitude of pursuit motion even when retinal motion is zero or constant. 
Their scheme also exhibited predictive qualities, as reported by Steinbach (1976). The 
smooth pursuit model presented in this paper attempts the consolidate the two models 
into a single system which explains the findings of both approaches.

The velocity based smooth pursuit implemented here attempts to zero the relative velocity 
of the retina and target. The measured retinal velocity, is zeroed by using positive 
feedback to accumulate relative velocity error between the target and the retina, where the 
accumulated value is the current eye velocity. Hence, this model uses the Robinson 
approach to match target motion, and the Wyatt and Pola positive txxl back loop to 
achieve matching and to predict the future velocity of the target. Figure 2 shows the 
system diagram of the velocity based smooth pursuit system. This system is analyzed 
and the stability criterion is derived. Possible computational blocks for the elements in 
figure l(b) are also discussed. Furthermore, since this entire scheme is implemented on a 
single 2 gm CMOS chip, the method for motion detection, the complete tracking circuits 
and the measured results are presented.

2 VELOCITY BASED SMOOTH PURSUIT 
Although figure l(b) does not indicate how retinal motion is used in smooth pursuit, it 
provides the only measurement of the projected target motion. The very process of 
calculating retinal motion realizes negative feed back between the eye movement and the 
target motion, since retinal motion is the difference between project target and eye 
motion. If Robinson's model is followed, then the eye movement is simply the 
amplified version of the retinal motion. If the target disappears from the retina, the eye 
motion would be zero. However, Steinbach showed that eye movement does not cease 
when the target fades off and on, indicating that memory is used to predict target motion. 
Wyatt and Palo showed a direct additive influence of eye movement on pursuit. However, 
the computational blocks G' and o of their model are left untilled.

In figure 2, the gain G models the internal gain of the motion detection system, and the 
internal representation of retinal velocity is then Vr. Under zero-slip tracking, the retinal 
velocity is zero. This is obtained by using positive feed back to correct the velocity error 
between target, Ot, and eye, Oe. The delay element represents a memory of the last eye 
velocity while the current retinal motion is measured. If the target disappears, the eye 
motion continues with the last value, as recorded by Steinbach, thus anticipating the 
position of the target in space. The memory also stores the current eye velocity during 
perfect pursuit. The internal representation of eye velocity, V e, is subsequently amplified 
by H and used to drive the eye muscles. The impulse response of the system is given in 
equations (1). Hence, the relationship between eye velocity and target velocity is recursire 
and given by equations (2). To prove the stability of this system, the retinal velocity can 
be expressed in terms of the target motion as given in equations (3a). The ideal condition 
for accurate performance is for GH = 1. However, in practice, gains of different amplifiers

are rarely perfectly matched. Equations (3b) shows that stability is assured for 0<GH< 2. 
Figure 3 shows a plot of eye motion versus updates for various choices of GH. At each 
update, the retinal motion is computed. Figure 3(a) shows the eye's motion at the on-set 
of smooth pursuit. For GH = 1, the eye movement tracks the target's motion exactly, 
and lags slightly only when the target accelerates. On the other hand, if GH << 1, the 
eye's motion always lags the target's. If GH -> 2, the system becomes increasing 
unstable, but converges for GH < 2. The three cases presented correspond to the smooth 
pursuit system being critically, over and under damped, respectively. 
3 HARDWARE IMPLEMENTATION 
Using the smooth pursuit mechanism described, a single chip one dimensional tracking 
system has been implemented. The chip has a multi-layered computational architecture, 
similar to the primate's visual system. Phototransduction, logarithmic compression, 
edge detection, motion detection and smooth pursuit control has been integrated at the 
focal-plane. The computational layers can be partitioned into three blocks, where each 
block is based on a segment of biological oculomotor systems. 
3.1 IMAGING AND PREPROCESSING 
The first three layers of the system mimics the photoreceptors, horizontal cells and 
bipolar cells of biological retinas. Similar to previous implementations of silicon 
retinas, the chip uses parasitic bipolar transistors as the photoreceptors. The dynamic 
range of photoreceptor current is compressed with a logarithmic response in low light and 
square root response in bright light. The range compress circuit represents 5-6 orders of 
magnitude of light intensity with 3 orders of magnitude of output current dynamic range. 
Subsequently, a passive resistive network is used to realize a discrete implementation of a 
Laplacian edge detector. Similar to the rods and cones system in primate retinas, the 
response time, hence the maximum detectable target speed, is ambient intensity dependent 
(160 (12.5) gs in 2.5 (250) gW/cm2). However, this does prevent the system from 
handling fast targets even in dim ambient lighting.

3.2 MOTION MEASUREMENT 
This computational layer measures retinal motion. The motion detection technique 
implemented here differs from those believed to exist in areas V 1 and MT of the primate 
visual cortex. Alternatively, it resembles the fly's and rabbit's retinal motion detection 
system (Reichardt, 1961; Barlow and Levick, 1965; Delbruck, 1993). This is not 
coincidental, since efficient motion detection at the focal plane must be performed in a 
small areas and using simple computational elements in both systems. 
The motion detection scheme is a combination of local correlation for direction 
determination, and pixel transfer time measurement for speed. In this framework, motion 
is defined as the disappearance of an object, represented as the zero-crossings of its edges, 
at a p
