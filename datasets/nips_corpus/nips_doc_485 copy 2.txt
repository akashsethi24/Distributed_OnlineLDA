Abstract 
During waking and sleep, the brain and mind undergo a tightly linked and 
precisely specified set of changes in state. At the level of neurons, this 
process has been modeled by variations of Volterra-Lotka equations for 
cyclic fluctuations of brainstem cell populations. However, neural network 
models based upon rapidly developing knowledge of the specific population 
connectivities and their differential responses to drugs have not yet been 
developed. Furthermore, only the most preliminary attempts have been 
made to model across states. Some of our own attempts to link rapid eye 
movement (REM) sleep neurophysiology and dream cognition using neural 
network approaches are summarized in this paper. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
New models are needed to test the closely linked neurophysiological and cognitive 
theories that are emerging from recent scientific studies of sleep and dreaming. This 
section describes four separate but related levels of analysis at which modeling may

be applied and outlines some of the desirable features of such models in terms of the 
burgeoning data of sleep and dream science. In the subsequent sections, we review 
our own preliminary efforts to develop models at some of the levels discussed. 
1.1 THE INDIVIDUAL NEURON 
Existing models or neurominesfaithfully represent membrane properties but ig- 
nore the dynamic biochemical changes that change neural excitability over the long 
term. This is particularly important in the modeling of state control where the 
crucial neurons appear to act more like hormone pumps than like simple electrical 
transducers. Put succinctly, we need models that consider the biochemical or wet 
aspects of nerve cells, as well as the dry or electrical aspects (of. McKenna et 
in press). 
1.2 NEURAL POPULATION INTERACTIONS 
To mimic the changes in excitability of the modulatory neurons which control sleep 
and dreaming, new models are needed which incorporate both the engineering prin- 
ciples of oscillators and the biological principles of time-keeping. The latter prin- 
ciple is especially relevant in determining the dramatically variable long period 
time-constants that are observed within and across species. For example, we need 
to equip population models borrowed from field biology (McCarley and Hobson, 
1975) with specialized properties of wetneurons as mentioned in section 1.1. 
1.3 
COGNITIVE CONSEQUENCES OF MODULATION OF 
NEURAL NETWORKS 
To understand the state-dependent changes in cognition, such as those that distin- 
guish waking and dreaming, a potentially fruitful approach is to mimic the known 
effects of neuromodulation and examine the information processing properties of 
neural networks. For example, if the input-output fidelity of networks can be al- 
tered by changing their mode (see Sutton et al., this volume), we might be better 
able to understand the changes in both instantaneous associative properties and 
long term plasticity alterations that occur in sleep and dreaming. We might thus 
trap the brain-mind into revealing its rules for making moment-to-moment cross- 
correlations of its data and for changing the content and status of its storage in 
memory. 
1.4 STATE-DEPENDENT CHANGES IN COGNITION 
At the highest level of analysis, psychological data, even that obtained from the 
introspection of waking and dreaming subjects, need to be more creatively reduced 
with a view to modeling the dramatic alterations that occur with changes in brain 
state. As an example, consider the instability of orientation of dreaming, where 
times, places, persons and actions change without notice. Short of mastering the 
thorny problem of generating narrative text from a data base, and thus synthesiz- 
ing an artificial dream, we need to formulate rules and measures of categorizing 
constancy and transformations (Sutton and Hobson, 1991). Such an approach is a

means of further refining the algorithms of cognition itself, an effort which is now 
limited to simple activation models that cannot change mode. 
An important characteristic of the set of new models that are proposed is that each 
level informs, and is informed by, the other levels. This nested, intexlocking feature 
is represented in figure 1. It should be noted that any erroneous assumptions made 
at level 1 will have effects at levels 2 and 3 and these will, in turn, impede our 
capacity to integrate levels 3 and 4. Level 4 models can and should thus proceed 
with a degree of independence from levels 1, 2 and 3. Proceeding from level 1 upward 
is the bottom-up approach, while proceeding from level 4 downward is the top- 
down approach. We like to think it might be possible to take both approaches in 
our work while according equal respect to each.

2 STATES OF WAKING AND SLEEPING 
The states of waking and sleeping, including REM and non-REM (NREM) sleep, 
have characteristic behavioral, neuronal, polygraphic and psychological features 
that span all four levels. These properties are summarized in figures 2 and 3. 
Changes occurring within and between different levels are affected by the sleep- 
wake or circadian cycle and by the relative shifts in brain chemistry.

.1 CIRCADIAN RHYTHMS 
The circadian cycle has been studied mathematically using oscillator and other 
non-linear dynamical models to capture features of sleep-wake rhythms (Moore-Ede 
and Czeisler, 1984; figure 2). Shorter (infradian) and longer (ultradian) rhythms, 
relative to the circadian rhythm, have also been examined. In general, oscillators 
are used to couple neural, endocrine and other pathways important in controlling 
a variety of functions, such as periods of rest and activity, energy conservation and 
thermoregulation. The oscillators can be sensitive to external cues or zeitgebers, 
such as light and daily routines, and there is a stong linkage between the circadian 
clock and the NREM-REM sleep oscillator. 
2.2 RECIPROCAL INTERACTION MODEL 
In the 1970s, a brainstem oscillator became identified that was central to regulating 
sleeping and waking. Discrete cell populations in the pons that were most active 
during waking, less active in NREM sleep and silent during REM sleep were found 
to contain the monoamines norepinephrine (NE) and serotonin (5HT). Among the 
many cell populations that became active during REM sleep, but were generally 
quiescent otherwise, were cells associated with acetylcholine (ACh) release.

8 Hobson, Mamelak, and Sutton 
By making a variety of simplifying assumptions, McCarley and Hobson (1975) 
were able to structurally and mathematically model the oscillations between these 
monoaminergic and cholinergic cell populations (figure 3). This level 2 model 
consists of two compartments, one being monoaminergic-inhibitory and the other 
cholinergic-excitatory. It is based pupon the assumptions of field biology (Volterra- 
Lotka) and of dry neuromines (level 3). The excitation (inhibition) originating from 
each compartment influences the other and also feeds back on itself. Numerous pre- 
dictions generated by the model have been verified experimentally (Hobson and 
Steriade, 1986).
