ABSTRACT 
We have developed a graphically oriented, general purpose 
simulation system to facilitate the modeling of neural networks. 
The simulator is implemented under UNIX and X-windows and is 
designed to support simulations at many levels of detail. 
Specifically, it is intended for use in both applied network 
modeling and in the simulation of detailed, realistic, biologically- 
based models. Examples of current models developed under this 
system include mammalian olfactory bulb and cortex, invertebrate 
central pattern generators, as well as more abstract connectionist 
simulations. 
INTRODUCTION 
Recently, there has been a dramatic increase in interest in exploring the 
computational properties of networks of parallel distributed processing elements 
(Rumelhart and McCleHand, 1986) often referred to as neural networks 
(Anderson, 1988). Much of the current research involves numerical simulations of 
these types of networks (Anderson, 1988; Touretzky, 1989). Over the last several 
years, there has also been a significant increase in interest in using similar computer 
simulation techniques to study the structure and function of biological neural 
networks. This effort can be seen as an attempt to reverse-engineer the brain with 
the objective of understanding the functional organization of its very complicated 
networks (Bower, 1989). Simulations of these systems range from detailed 
reconstructions of single neurons, or even components of single neurons, to 
simulations of large networks of complex neurons (Koch and $egev, 1989). 
Modelers associated with each area of research are likely to benefit from exposure to 
a large range of neural network simulations. A simulation package capable of 
implementing these varied types of network models would facilitate this interaction.

DESIGN FEATURES OF THE SIMULATOR 
We have built GENESIS (GEneral NEtwork Simulation System) and its graphical 
interface XODUS (X-based Output and Display Utility for Simulators) to provide a 
standardized and flexible means of constructing neural network simulations while 
making minimal assumptions about the actual structure of the neural components. 
The system is capable of growing according to the needs of users by incorporating 
user-defined code. We will now describe the specific features of this system. 
Device independence. 
The entire system has been designed to run under UNIX and X-windows (version 
11) for maximum portability. The code was developed on Sun workstations and has 
been ported to Sun3's, Sun4's, Sun 386i's, and Masscomp computers. It should be 
portable to all installations supporting UNIX and X-11. In addition, we will be 
developing a parallel implementation of the simulation system (Nelson et al., 1989). 
Modular design. 
The design of the simulator and interface is based on a building-block approach. 
Simulations are constructed of modules which receive inputs, perform calculations 
on them, and generate outputs (figs. 2,3). This approach is central to the generality 
and flexibility of the system as it allows the user to easily add new features 
without modification to the base code. 
Interactive specification and control. 
Network specification and control is done at a high level using graphical tools and a 
network specification language (fig. 1). The graphics interface provides the highest 
and most user friendly level of interaction. It consists of a number of tools which 
the user can configure to suit a particular simulation. Through the graphical 
interface the user can display, control and adjust the parameters of simulations. The 
network specification language we have developed for network modeling represents a 
more basic level of interaction. This language consists of a set of simulator and 
interface functions that can be executed interactively from the keyboard or from 
text files storing command sequences (scripts). The language also provides for 
arithmetic operations and program control functions such as looping, conditional 
statements, and subprograms or macros. Figures 3 and 4 demonstrate how some of 
these script functions are used. 
Simulator and interface toolkits. 
Extendable toolkits which consist of module libraries, graphical tools and the 
simulator base code itself (fig. 2) provide the routines and modules used to 
construct specific simulations. The base code provides the common control and 
support routines for the entire system.

CONSTRUCTING SIMULATIONS 
The first step in using GENESIS involves selecting and linking together those 
modules from the toolkits that will be necessary for a particular simulation (fig. 
2,3). Additional commands in the scripting language establish the network and the 
graphical interface (fig. 4). 
Module Classes. 
Modules in GENESIS are divided into computational modules, communications 
modules and graphical modules. All instances of computational modules are called 
elements. These are the central components of simulations, performing all of the 
numerical calculations. Elements can communicate in two ways: via links and via 
connections. Links allow the passing of data between two elements with no time 
delay and with no computation being performed on the data. Thus, links serve to 
unify a large number of elements into a single computational unit (e.g. they are 
used to link elements together to form the neuron in fig. 3C). Connections, on the 
other hand, interconnect computational units via simulated communication channels 
which can incorporate time delays and perform transformations on data being 
transmitted (e.g. axons in fig. 3C). Graphical modules called widgets are used to 
construct the interface. These modules can issue script commands as well as respond 
to them, thus allowing interactive access to simulator structures and functions.

Hierarchical organization. 
In order to keep track of the structure of a simulation, elements are organized into a 
tree hierarchy similar to the directory structure in UNIX (fig. 3B). The tree 
structure does not explicitly represent the pattern of links and connections between 
elements, it is simply a tool for organizing complex groups of elements in the 
simulation. 
Simulation example. 
As an example of the types of modules available and the process of structuring them 
into a network simulation and graphical interface, we will describe the construction 
of a simple biological neural simulation (fig. 3). The mldel consists of two 
neurons. Each neuron contains a passive dendritic compartment, an active cell body, 
an axonal output, and a synaptic input onto the dendrite. The axon of one neuron 
connects to a synaptic input of the other. Figure 3 shows the basic structure of the 
model as implemented under GENESIS. In the model, the synapse, channels,

dendritic compartments, cell body and axon are each treated as separate 
computational elements (fig. 3C). Links allow elements to share information (e.g. 
the Na channel needs to have access to the cell-body membrane voltage). Figure 4 
shows a portion of the script used to construct this simulation.

Memory requirements of GENESIS. 
Currently, GENESIS consists of about 20,000 lines of simulator code and a similar 
amount of graphics code, all written in C. The executable binaries take up about 1.5 
Megabytes. A rough estimate of the amount of additional memory necessary for a 
particular simulation can be calculated from the sizes and number of modules used 
in a simulation. Typically, elements use around 100 bytes, connections
