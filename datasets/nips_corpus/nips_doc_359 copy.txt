Abstract 
This study has demonstrated how artificial neural networks (ANNs) can 
be used to characterize seismic sources using high-frequency regional 
seismic data. We have taken the novel approach of using AN-Ns as a 
research tool for obtaining seismic source information, specifically 
depth of focus for earthquakes and ripple-fire characteristics for 
economic blasts, rather than as just a feature classifier between 
earthquake and explosion populations. Overall, we have found that 
ANNs have potential applications to seismic event characterization and 
identification, beyond just as a feature classifier. In future studies, these 
techniques should be applied to actual data of regional seismic events 
recorded at the new regional seismic arrays. The results of this study 
indicates that an ANN should be evaluated as part of an operational 
seismic event identification system. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
1.1 NEURAL NETWORKS FOR SEISMIC SOURCE ANALYSIS 
In this study, we have explored the application of artificial neural networks (ANNs) for 
-the characterization of seismic sources for the purpose of distinguishing between 
explosions and earthquakes. ANNs have usually been used as pattern matching 
algorithms, and recent studies have applied ANNs to standard classification between 
classes of earthquakes and explosions using waveform features (Dowla, et al, 1989), 
(Dysart and Pulli, 1990). However, in considering the current state-of-the-art in seismic 
event identification, we believe the most challenging problem is not to develop a superior 
classification method, but rather, to have a better understanding of the physics of seismic 
source and regional signal propagation.

Lg Depth Estimation and Ripple Fire Characterization 545 
Our approach to the problem has been to use ANN technology as a research tool for 
obtaining a better understanding of the phenomenology behind regional discrimination, 
with emphasis on high-frequency regional array data, as well as using ANNs as a pattern 
classifier. We have explored two applications of ANNs to seismic source 
characterization: (1) the use of ANNs for depth characterization and (2) the recognition of 
ripple-firing effects in economic explosions. 
In the first study, we explored the possible use of the Lg cross-coherence matrix, 
measured at a regional array, as a hidden discriminant for event depth of focus. In the 
second study, we experimented with applying ANNs to the recognition of ripple-fire 
effects in the spectra of regional phases. Moreover, we also investigated how a small 
(around 5 Kt yield) possibly alecoupled nuclear explosion, detonated as part of a ripple-fire 
sequence, would affect the spectral modulations observed at regional distances and how 
these effects could be identified by the ANN. 
1.2 ANN DESCRIPTION 
MLP Architecture: The ANN that we used was a multilayer perceptron (MLP) 
architecture with a backpropagation training algorithm (Rumelhart, et al, 1986). The 
input layer is fully connected to the hidden layer, which is fully connected to the output 
layer. There are no connections within an individual layer. Each node communicates 
with another node through a weighted connection. Associated with each connection is a 
weight connecting input node to hidden node, and a weight connecting hidden node to 
output node. The output of activation level of a particular node is defined as the linear 
weighted sum of all its inputs. For an MLP, a sigmoidal transformation is applied to 
this weighted sum. Two layers of our network have activation levels. 
MLP Training: The MLP uses a backpropagation training algorithm which employs 
an iterating process where an output error signal is propagated back through the network 
and used to modify weight values. Training involves presenting sweeps of input patterns 
to the network and backpropagating the error until it is minimized. It is the weight 
values that represent a trained network and which can be used in the 
recognition/classification phase. 
MLP Recognition: Recognition, on the other hand, involves presenting a pattern to 
a trained network and propagating node activation levels uni-directionally from the input 
layer, through the hidden layer(s), to the output layer, and then selecting the class 
corresponding to the highest output (activation) signal. 
2 Lg DEPTH ESTIMATION 
In theory, the Lg phase, which is often the largest regional phase on the seismogram, 
should provide depth information because Lg results from the superposition of numerous 
normal modes in the crust, whose excitation is highly depth dependent. Some studies 
have shown that Lg amplitudes do depend on depth (Der and Baumgardt, 1989). However, 
the precise dependency of Lg amplitude on depth has been hard to establish because other 
effects in the crustal model, such as anelastic attenuation, can also affect the Lg wave 
amplitude. 
546 Perry and Baumgardt 
In this study, we have considered if the Lg coherence, measured across a regional array, 
might show depth dependency. This idea is based on the fact that all the normal modes 
which comprise Lg propagate at different phase velocities. For multilayered media, the 
normal modes will have frequency-dependent phase velocities because of dispersion. Our 
method for studying this dependency is a neural network implementation of a technique, 
called matched field processing, which has been used in underwater acoustics for source 
water-depth estimation (Bucker, 1976), (Baggeroer, et al, 1988). This method consists of 
computing the spectral matrix of an emitted signal, in our case, Lg, and comparing it 
against the same spectral matrix for master events at different depths. In the past, various 
optimal methods have been developed for the matching process. In our study, we have 
investigated using a neural network to accomplish the matching. 
2.1 SPECTRAL MATRIX CALCULATION AND MATCHED FIELD 
PROCESSING 
The following is a description of how the spectral matrix is computed. First, the 
synthetic seismograms for each of the nine elements of the hypothetical array are Fourier 
transformed in some time window. If Si (co) is the Fourier transform of a time window 
for the i the channel, then, the spectral matrix is written as, Hij (oo) --S i (o) Sf*(o ), where 
St (o) =A  e 'J t,, *  ( , )1, the index j is the complex number, t is the phase angle, and 
the * represents complex transpose. The elements, aik of the spectral matrix can be 
written as aa(�o)=Ai Ake'i�i'kl where the exponential phase shift term 
 (o)-  (o)- ro 
is c, (to) � Cn (co) represents the phase velocity for 
mode n, which is a function of frequency because of dispersion, xi - Xk is the spatial 
separation of the i th and k th channels of the array, and � i k (C0) is the time shift of 
mode n at frequency co across the two channels. The product of the synthetic 
eigenfunctions, A i , and thus, the spectral matrix terms, are functions of source depth and 
model parameters. 
The spectral matrix, H ij (co), can be computed for an entire synthetic waveform or for a 
window on a part of the waveform. The elements of the spectral matrix can be 
normalized by inter- or intm- window normalization so that its values range from 0 to 1. 
2.2 ANN . MATCHED FIELD DEPTH ESTIMATION 
Two different depth studies were performed during this effort. The first study evaluated 
using the ANN to classify deep (greater than 4 kilometers) vs. shallow (less than 4 
kilometers) seismic events. The number of input nodes equaled the number of points in 
the spectral matrix which was 1620 (36 data points x 45 spectral elements after 
smoothing). The number of output nodes was dependent on the type of classification we 
wanted to perform. For the shallow-deep discrimination, we only required two output 
nodes, one for each class. Training the ANN involved compiling a training (exemplar) 
set of spectral matrices for various shallow and deep events and then presenting the 
training set to the ANN. 
In the second study, we investigated if the ANN could be used to classify seismic events 
at different depths. Again, we used five windows on the Lg phase and implemented the 
Lg Depth Estimation and Ripple Fire Characterization 547 
interwindow and intrawindow normalization procedure. The second network was trained 
with a seven-element depth vector, whose elements represent the depths of 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 
16, and 20 kilometers. 
3 RIPPLE-FIRE CHARACTERIZATION 
In this study, we wanted to determine if spectral modulations could be recognized by the 
neural network and if they could be attached to concepts relating to the source parameters 
of ripple-fired events. Previous studies have demonstrated how such patterns could be 
found by looking for time-independent spectral modulations (Baumgardt and Ziegler, 
1989), (Hedlin, et al, 1990). In this study, we assumed such a pattern has been found and 
that the input to the ANN is one of the time-independent spectra. An additional issue we 
considered was whether it would be possible to hide a nuclear explosion in the ripple-fare 
pattern, and whether or not such a pattern might be recognizable by an ANN. In this 
study, as in the previous depth characterization study, we relied entirely on simulated data 
for training and test. 
3.1 ANN - RIPPLE FIRE CHARACTERIZATION 
We performed two ripple-fried studies which were designed to extract different parameters 
from the tipple-fared events. The two studies characterized the following parameters: 1) 
time delay (Experiment A), and 2) normal vs. anomalous (Experiment B). The purpose 
of the time delay study was to estimate the time delay between explosions irrespective of 
the n
