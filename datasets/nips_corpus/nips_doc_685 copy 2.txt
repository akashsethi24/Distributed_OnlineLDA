Abstract 
Large VC-dimension classifiers can learn difficult tasks, but are usually 
impractical because they generalize well only if they are trained with huge 
quantities of data. In this paper we show that even high-order polynomial 
classifiers in high dimensional spaces can be trained with a small amount 
of training data and yet generalize better than classifiers with a smaller 
VC-dimension. This is achieved with a maximum margin algorithm (the 
Generalized Portrait). The technique is applicable to a wide variety of 
classifiers, including Percepttons, polynomial classifiers (sigma-pi unit net- 
works) and Radial Basis Functions. The effective number of parameters is 
adjusted automatically by the training algorithm to match the complexity 
of the problem. It is shown to equal the number of those training patterns 
which are closest patterns to the decision boundary (supporting patterns). 
Bounds on the generalization error and the speed of convergence of the al- 
gorithm are given. Experimental results on handwritten digit recognition 
demonstrate good generalization compared to other algorithms. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
Both experimental evidence and theoretical studies [1] link the generalization of a 
classifier to the error on the training examples and the capacity of the classifier.

Classifiers with a large number of adjustable parameters, and therefore large ca- 
pacity, likely learn the training set without error, but exhibit poor generalization. 
Conversely, a classifier with insufficient capacity might not be able to learn the task 
at all. The goal of capacity tuning methods is to find the optimal capacity which 
minimizes the expected generalization error for a given amount of training data. 
Capacity tuning techniques include: starting with a low capacity system and allocat- 
ing more parameters as needed or starting with an large capacity system and elim- 
inating unnecessary adjustable parameters with regularization. The first method 
requires searching in the space of classifier structures which possibly contains many 
local minima. The second method is computationally inefficient since it does not 
avoid adjusting a large number of parameters although the effective number of pa- 
rameters may be small. 
With the method proposed in this paper, the capacity of some very large VC- 
dimension classifiers is adjusted automatically in the process of training. The prob- 
lem is formulated as a quadratic programming problem which has a single global 
minimum. Only the effective parameters get adjusted during training which ensures 
computational efficiency. 
1.1 MAXIMUM MARGIN AND SUPPORTING PATTERNS 
Here is a familiar problem: Given is a limited number of training examples from two 
classes A and B; find the linear decision boundary which yields best generalization 
performance. When the training data is scarce, there exists usually many errorless 
separations (figure 1.1). This is especially true when the dimension of input space 
(i.e. the number of tunable parameters) is large compared to the number of training 
examples. The question arises which of these solutions to choose? The one solution 
that achieves the largest possible margin between the decision boundary and the 
training patterns (figure 1.2) is optimal in the minimax sense [2] (see section 2.2). 
This choice is intuitively justifiable: a new example from class A is likely to fall 
within or near the convex envelope of the examples of class A (and similarly for 
class B). By providing the largest possible safety margin, we minimize the chances 
that examples from class A and B cross the border to the wrong side. 
An important property of the maximum margin solution is that it is only depen- 
dent upon a restricted number of training examples, called supporting patterns (or 
informative patterns). These are those examples which lie on the margin and there- 
fore are closest to the decision boundary (figure 1.2). The number rn of linearly 
independent supporting patterns satisfies the inequality' 
rn < min(N + 1,p). (1) 
In this inequality, (N + 1) is the number of adjustable parameters and equals the 
Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension (VC-dimension) [2], and p is the number of training 
examples. In reference [3], we show that the generalization error is bounded by m/p 
and therefore m is a measure of complexity of the learning problem. Because m is 
bounded by p and is generally a lot smaller than p, the maximum margin solution 
obtains good generalization even when the problem is grossly underdetermined, 
i.e. the number of training patterns p is much smaller than the number of adjustable 
parameters, N + 1. In section 2.3 we show that the existence of supporting patterns 
is advantageous for computational reasons as well.

1.2 NON-LINEAR CLASSIFIERS 
Although algorithms that maximize the margin between classes have been known 
for many years [4, 2], they have for computational reasons so far been limited to the 
special case of finding linear separations and consequently to relatively simple clas- 
siftcation problems. In this paper, we present an extension to one of these maximum 
margin training algorithms called the Generalized Portrait Method (GP) [2] to 
various non-linear classifiers, including including Perceptrons, polynomial classifiers 
(sigma-pi unit networks) and kernel clsifiers (Radial Basis Functions) (figure 2). 
The new algorithm trains efficiently very high VC-dimension classifiers with a huge 
number of tunable parameters. Despite the large number of free parameters, the 
solution exhibits good generalization due to the inherent regularization of the max- 
imum margin cost function. 
As an example, let us consider the case of a second order polynomial classifier. Its 
decision surface is described by the following equation: 
> ] + + o. 
i i,j 
he wi, Wij and b are adjustable parameters, and xi are the coordinates of a pattern 
x. If n is the dimension of input pattern x, the number of adjustable parameters 
of the second order polynomial classifier is [n(n-9 1)/2]-9 1. In general, the number 
of adjustable parameters of a qth order polynomial is of the order of N  n q. 
The GP algorithm has been tested on the problem of handwritten digit recognition. 
The input patterns consist of 16 x 16 pixel images (n - 256). The results achieved

Table 1: Handwritten digit recognition experiments. The first database 
(DB1) consists of 1200 clean images recorded from ten subjects. Half of this data 
is used for training, and the other half is used to evaluate the generalization per- 
formance. The other database (DB2) consists of 7300 images for training and 2000 
for testing and has been recorded from actual mail pieces. We use ten polynomial 
classification functions of order q, separating one class against all others. We list the 
number N of adjustable parameters, the error rates on the test set and the average 
number <re>of supporting patterns per separating hypersurface. The results com- 
pare favorably to neural network classifiers which minimize the mean squared error 
with backpropagation. For the one layer network (linear classifier) ,the error on the 
test set is 12.7 % on DB1 and larger than 25 % on DB2. The lowest error rate for 
DB2, 4.9%, obtained with a forth order polynomial, is comparable to the 5.1% 
error obtained with a multi-layer neural network with sophisticated architecture 
being trained and tested on the same data [6]. 
with polynomial classifiers of order q are summarized in table 1. Also listed is 
the number of adjustable parameters, N. This quantity increases rapidly with q 
and quickly reaches a level that is computationally intractable for algorithms that 
explicitly compute each parameter [5]. Moreover, as N increases, the learning prob- 
lem becomes grossly underdetermined: the number of training patterns (p = 600 
for DB1 and p = 7300 for DB2) becomes very small compared to N. Nevertheless, 
good generalization is achieved as shown by the experimental results listed in the 
table. This is a consequence of the inherent regularization of the algorithm. 
An important concern is the sensitivity of the maximum margin solution to the 
presence of outliers in the training data. It is indeed important to remove undesired 
outliers (such as meaningless or mislabeled patterns) to get best generalization 
performance. Conversely, good outliers (such as examples of rare styles) must be 
kept. Cleaning techniques have been developed based on the re-examination by a 
human supervisor of those supporting patterns which result in the largest increase of 
the margin when removed, and thus, are the most likely candidates for ou
