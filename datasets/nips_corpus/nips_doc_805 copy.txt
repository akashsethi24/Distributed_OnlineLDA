Abstract 
Intradendritic electrophysiological recordings reveal a bewildering 
repertoire of complex electrical spikes and plateaus that are dif- 
ficult to reconcile with conventional notions of neuronal function. 
In this paper we argue that such dendritic events are just an exu- 
berant expression of a more important mechanism - a proportional 
current amplifier whose primary task is to offset electrotonic losses. 
Using the example of functionally important synaptic inputs to the 
superficial layers of an anatomically and electrophysiologically re- 
constructed layer 5 pyramidal neuron, we derive and simulate the 
properties of conductances that linearize and amplify distal synap- 
tic input current in a graded manner. The amplification depends 
on a potassium conductance in the apical tuft and calcium conduc- 
tances in the apical trunk.

1 INTRODUCTION 
About half the pyramidal neurons in layer 5 of neocortex have long apical dendrites 
that arborize extensively in layers 1-3. There the dendrites receive synaptic input 
from the inter-areal feedback projections (Felleman and van Essen, 1991) that play 
an important role in many models of brain function (Rockland and Virga, 1989). 
At first sight this seems to be an unsatisfactory arrangement. In light of traditional 
passive models of dendritic function the distant inputs cannot have a significant 
effect on the output discharge of the pyramidal cell. The distal inputs are at least 
one to two space constants removed from the soma in layer 5 and so only a small 
fraction of the voltage signal will reach there. Nevertheless, experiments in cortical 
slices have shown that synapses located in even the most superficial cortical layers 
can provide excitation strong enough to elicit action potentials in the somata of 
layer 5 pyramidal cells (Cauller and Connors, 1992, 1994). These results suggest 
that the apical dendrites are active rather than passive, and able to amplify the 
signal en route to the soma. Indeed, electrophysiological recordings from cortical 
pyramidal cells provide ample evidence for a variety of voltage-dependent dendritic 
conductances that could perform such amplification (Spencer and Kandel, 1961; 
Regehr et al., 1993; Yuste and Tank, 1993; Pockberger, 1991; Amitai et al., 1993; 
Kim and Connors, 1993). 
Although the available experimental data on the various active conductances pro- 
vide direct support for amplification, they are not adequate to specify the mecha- 
nism by which it occurs. Consequently, notions of dendritic amplification have been 
informal, usually favoring voltage gain, and mechanisms that have a binary (high 
gain) quality. In this paper, we formalize what conductance properties are required 
for a current amplifier, and derive the required form of their voltage dependency by 
analysis. 
We propose that current amplification depends on two active conductances: a 
voltage-dependent K + conductance, gK, in the superficial part of the dendritic 
tree that linearizes synaptic input, and a voltage-dependent Ca 2+ conductance, 
gca, in layer 4 that amplifies the result of the linearization stage. Spencer and Kan- 
del (1961) hypothesized the presence of dendritic calcium channels that amplify 
distal inputs. More recently, a modeling study of a cerebellar Purkinje cell suggests 
that dendritic calcium counteracts attenuation of distal inputs so that the somatic 
response is independent of synaptic location (De Schutter and Bower, 1992). A 
gain-control mechanism involving both potassium and calcium has also been pro- 
posed in locust non-spiking interneurons (Laurent, 1993). In these cells, the two 
conductances counteract the nonlinearity of graded transmitter release, so that the 
output of the interneuron was independent of its membrane voltage. The principle 
that we used can be explained with the help of a highly simplified three compart- 
ment model (Fig. 1A). The leftmost node represents the soma and is clamped to 
-50 mV. The justification for this is that the time-averaged somatic voltage is re- 
markably constant and close to -50 mV for a wide range of spike rates. The middle 
node represents the apical trunk containing gca, and the rightmost node represents 
the apical tuft with a synaptic induced conductance change gsyn in parallel with 
gK. For simplicity we assume that the model is in steady-state, and has an infinite 
membrane resistance,

ment was clamped to Voma = -50 rnV with Eca= 115 mV, EK = --95 rnV,

only steady state properties were studied, and membrane leak was not included for 
simplicity. (B) Somatic current, Ioma, in response to synaptic input. The pas-

The linearized response (thick solid line) is obtained by introducing an inactivating 
potassium conductance, GK (gA in c). A persistent persistent GK results in a 
somewhat sub-linear response (thick dashed line; gM in c). The addition of a cal- 
cium conductance amplifies the response (thin solid line). (C) Analytically derived

2 RESULTS 
Fig. lB shows the computed rela{onship between the excitatory synaptic input 
conductance and the axial current, Io,a, flowing into the somatic (leftmost) com- 
partment. The synaptic input rapidly saturates; increasing g,yn beyond about 50 nS 
leads to little further increase in Iso,a. This saturation is due to the EPSP in the 
distal compartment reducing the effective synaptic driving potential. We propose 
that the first goal of dendritic amplification is to linearize this relationship, so that 
the soma is more sensitive to the exact amount of excitatory input impinging on 
the apical tuft, by introducing a potassium conductance that provides a hyper- 
polarizing current in proportion to the degree of membrane depolarization. The 
voltage-dependence of such a conductance can be derived by postulating a linear 
relationship between the synaptic current flowing into the somatic node and the 
synaptic input, i.e. Io,,a = constant 'gun. In conjunction with Ohm's law and 
current conservation, this relation leads to a simple fractional polynominal for the 
voltage dependency of gK (labeled gA in Fig. 1C). As the membrane potential 
depolarizes, gK activates and pulls it back towards EK. At large depolarizations gK 
inactivates, similar to the A potassium conductance, resulting overall in a linear 
relationship between input and output (Fig. lB). As the slope conductance of this 
particular form of gK can become negative, causing amplification of the synaptic 
input, we use a variant of 9K that is monotonized by leveling out the activation 
curve after it has reached its maximum, similar to the M current (Fig. 1C). Incor- 
porating this non-inactivating K + conductance into the distal compartment results 
in a slightly sublinear relationship between input and output (Fig. lB). 
With #K in place, amplification of Io,,a is achieved by introducing an inward 
current between the soma and the postsynaptic site. The voltage-dependency of the 
amplification conductance can be derived by postulating Io,,a = 9ain ï¿½ constant. 
#sun. This leads to the non-inactivating #ca shown in Fig. 1C, in which the overall 
relationship between synaptic input and somatic output current (Fig. lB) reflects 
the amplification. 
We extend this concept of deriving the form of the required conductances to a 
detailed model of a morphologically reconstructed layer 5 pyramidal cell from cat 
visual cortex (Douglas et al., 1991, Fig. 2A;). We assume a passive dendritic tree, 
and include a complement of eight common voltage-dependent conductances in its 
soma. 500 non-NMDA synapses are distributed on the dendritic tuft throughout 
layers 1, 2 and 3, and we assume a proportionaltry between the presynaptic firing 
frequency fin and the time-averaged synaptic induced conductance change. When 
fin is increased, the detailed model exhibits the same saturation as seen in the 
simple model (Fig. 2B). Even if all 500 synapses are activated at fin = 500 Hz only 
0.65 nA of current is delivered to the soma. This saturation is caused when the 
synaptic input current flows into the high input resistances of the distal dendrites, 
thereby reducing the synaptic driving potential. Layer 1 and 2 input together can 
contribute a maximum of 0.25 nA to the soma. This is too little current to cause 
the cell to spike, in contrast with the experimental evidence (Cauller and Connors, 
1994), in which spike discharge was evoked reliably. Electrotonic losses make only 
a minor contribution to the small somatic signal. Even when the membrane leak 
current is eliminated by setting Rrn to infinity, Ioma only increases a mere 2% to 
0.66 nA.
