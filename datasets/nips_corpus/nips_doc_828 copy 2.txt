Abstract 
The goal of this work was to investigate the role of primate 
MT neurons in solving the structure from motion (SFM) 
problem. Three types of receptive field (RF) surrounds 
found in area MT neurons (K. Tanaka et a/.,1986; Allman et 
a/.,1985) correspond, as our analysis suggests, to the 0 th, I st 
and 2 nd order fuzzy space-differential operators. The large 
surround/center radius ratio (> 7) allows both 
differentiation of smooth velocity fields and discontinuity 
detection at boundaries of objects. The model is in 
agreement with recent psychophysical data on surface 
interpolation involvement in SFM. We suggest that area 
MT partially segregates information about object shape 
from information about spatial relations necessary for 
navigation and manipulation. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
Both neurophysiological investigations [8] and lesioned human patients' 
data show that the Middle Temporal (MT) cortical area is crucial to 
perceiving three-dimensional shape in moving stimuli. On the other hand,

a solid body of data (e.g. [1]) has been gathered about functional properties 
of neurons in the area MT. Hoever, the relation between our ability to 
perceive structure in stimuli, simulating 3-D objects, and neuronal 
properties has not been addressed up to date. Here we discuss a 
possibility, that area MT RF surrounds might be involved in shape-from- 
motion perception. We introduce a simplifying model of MT neurons and 
analyse the implications to SFM problem solving. 
2 REDEFINING THE SFM PROBLEM 
2.1 RELATIVE MOTION AS A CUE FOR RELATIVE DEPTH 
Since Helmholtz motion parallax is known to be a powerful cue providing 
information about both the structure of the surrounding environment and 
the direction of self-motion. On the other hand, moving objects also induce 
velocity fields allowing judgement about their shapes. We can capture both 
cases by assuming that an observer is tracking a point on a surface of 
interest. The velocity field of an object then is (fig. l): V = t z + w x (R - R o ) 
=-tz+WXZ, where w=[Wx,Wy,0] is an effective rotation vector of a surface 
z=[x,y,z(x,y)]; Ro=[0,0,z0 ] is a positional vector of the fixation point; t z is a 
translational component along Z axis.

The component velocities of a retinal velocity field under perspective 
projection can be calculated from: 
WyZ --Xtz -wxxy+Wy x2 wZ -Ytz +WyXy--wxY 2 
ZO +z (Zo +Z) 2 , V---- 
Z 0 + Z (Z 0 + Z) 2 
In natural viewing conditions the distance to the surface z 0 is usually much 
larger than variation in distance on the surface z : z0>>z. In such the 
second term in the above equations vanishes. In the case of translation 
tangential to the ground, to which we confine our analysis, w=[0,Wy,0] - 
[0,w,0], and the retinal velocity reduces to 
u = -wz/(zo+z) -- -wz/zo, v=O (1). 
The latter relation allows the assumption of orthographic projection, which 
approximates the retinal velocity field rather well within the central 20 deg 
of the visual field. 
2.2 SFM PERCEPTION INVOLVES SURFACE INTERPOLATION 
Human SFM perception is characterized by an interesting peculiarity -- 
surface interpolation [7]. This fact supports the hypothesis that an 
assumption of surface continuity is embedded in visual system. Thus, we 
can redefine the SFM problem as a problem of characterizing the 
interpolating surfaces. The principal normal curvatures are a local 
measure of surface invariant with respect to translation and rotation of the 
coordinate system. The orientation of the surface (normal vector) and its 
distance to the observer provide the information essential for navigation 
and object manipulation. The first and second order differentials of a 
surface function allow recovery of both surface curvature and orientation. 
3 MODEL OF AREA MT RECEPTIVE FIELD SURROUNDS 
3.1 THREE TYPES OF RECEPTIVE FIELD SURROUNDS 
The Middle Temporal (MT) area of monkeys is specialized for the 
systematic representation of direction and velocity of visual motion [1,2]. 
MT neurons are known to posess large, silent (RFS, the nonclassical RF. 
Born and Tootell [4] have very recently reported that the RF surrounds of 
neurons in owl monkey MT can be divided into antagonistic and synergistic 
types (Fig.2a).

About 44% of the owl monkey neuron RFSs recorded by Allman et al. [3] 
showed antagonistic properties. Approximately 33% of these demonstrated 
V(or U)oshaped (Fig. 2b), and 66% - quasi-linear velocity tuning curves 
(Fig. 2c, d). One half of Macaca fuscata neurons with antagonistic RFS 
found by Tanaka et al [9] have had V(U)-shaped velocity tuning curves, 
and 50% monotonically increasing or decreasing velocity tuning curves. 
The RFS were tested for symmetry [9] and no asymmetrical surrounds 
were found in primate MT. 
3.2 CONSTRUCTING IDEALIZED MT FILTERS 
The surround (S) and center (C) responses seem to be largely independent 
(except for the requirement that the velocity in the center must be nonzero) 
and seem to combine in an additive fashion [5]. This property allows us to 
combine C and S components in our model independently. The resulting 
filters can be reduced to three types, described below. 
3.2.1 Discrete Filters 
The essential properties of the three types of RFSs in area MT can be 
captured by the following difference equations. We choose the slopes of 
velocity tuning curves in the center to be equal to the ones in the surround; 
this is essential for obtaining the desired properties for 12 but not 10. The 0- 
order (or low-pass) and the 2nd order (or band-pass) filters are defined by:

l o=goyy(uc+us(i,j))+ConstO ,; 12=g2yy(uc-us(i,j))+Const2, (2) 
i j i j 
where g is gain, wi j =1, ije [-r,r] (r = radius of integration). Speed scalars 
u(ij) at points [ij] replace the velocity vectors 17 due to eq. (1). Constants 
correspond to spontaneous activity levels. 
In order to achieve the V(U) -shaped tuning for the surround in Fig.2b, a 
nonlinearity has to be introduced: 
li =gi(Uc-Us(i,j)) 2 +Constl. (3) 
i j 
The responses of 11 and 12 filters to standard mapping stimuli used in [3,9] 
are plotted together with their biological correlates in Fig. 3. 
3.2.2 Continuous analogues of MT filters 
We now develop continuous, more biologicaly plausible, versions of our 
three MT filters. We assume that synaptic weights for both center and 
surround regions fall off with distance from the RF center as a Gaussian 
function G(x,y,(), and ( is different for center and surround: (c  Cs- Then, 
by convolving with Gaussians equation (2) can be rewritten: 
L o (i,j)= u(i,j)*G(o c )+u(i,j)*G(o s ), 
L (i,j) = +[u(i,j)*G({J c )-u(i,j)*G({J s )]. 
The continuous nonlinear L1 filter can be defined if equivalence to l (eq. 3) 
is observed only up to the second order term of power series for u(ij): 
Li (i,j)=u 2 (i,j)*G({ c )+u 2 (i,j)*G(c s )-C.[u(i,j)*G({ c )].[u(i,j)*G(c s )]; 
u2(ij) corresponds to full-wave rectification and seems to be common in 
area V1 complex neurons; C = 2/Erf2(n/2 /2) is a constant, and Erf0 is an 
error function. 
3.3 THE ROLE OF MT NEURONS IN SFM PERCEPTION. 
Expanding z(x,y) function in (1) into power series around an arbitrary 
point and truncating above the second order term yields: 
u(x,y)=w(ax2+by2+cxy+dx+ey+f)/zo, where a,b,c,d,e,f are expansion 
coefficients. We assume that w is known (from proprioceptive input) and 
=1. Then z 0 remans an unresolved scaling factor and we omit it for 
simplicity.
