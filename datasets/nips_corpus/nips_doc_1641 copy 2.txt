Abstract 
When a visual image consists of a figure against a background, V1 
cells are physiologically observed to give higher responses to image 
regions corresponding to the figure relative to their responses to 
the background. The medial axis of the figure also induces rela- 
tively higher responses compared to responses to other locations 
in the figure (except for the boundary between the figure and the 
background). Since the receptive fields of V1 cells are very smal- 
l compared with the global scale of the figure-ground and medial 
axis effects, it has been suggested that these effects may be caused 
by feedback from higher visual areas. I show how these effects can 
be accounted for by V1 mechanisms when the size of the figure 
is small or is of a certain scale. They are a manifestation of the 
processes of pre-attentive segmentation which detect and highlight 
the boundaries between homogeneous image regions. 
I Introduction 
Segmenting figure from ground is one of the most important visual tasks. We nei- 
ther know how to execute it on a computer in general, nor do we know how the 
brain executes it. Further, the medial axis of a figure has been Suggested as provid- 
ing a convenient skeleton representation of its shape (Blum 1973). It is therefore 
exciting to find that responses of cells in V1, which is usually considered a low level 
visual area, differentiate between figure and ground (Lamme 1995, Lamme, Zipser, 
and Spekreijse 1997, Zipser, Lamme, Schiller 1996) and highlight the medial axis 
(Lee, Mumford, Romero, and Lainme 1998). This happens even though the recep- 
tive fields in V1 are much smaller than the scale of these global and perceptually 
significant phenomena. A common assumption is that feedback from higher visual 
areas is mainly responsible for these effects. This is supported by the finding that 
the figure-ground effects in V1 can be strongly reduced or abolished by anaesthesia 
or lesions in higher visual areas (Lamme et al 1997). 
However, in a related experiment (Gallant, van Essen, and Nothdur�t 1995), Vl 
cells were found to give higher responses to global boundaries between two texture 
regions. Further, this border effect was significant only 10-15 milliseconds after the 
initial responses of the cells and was present even under anaesthesia. It is thus

plausible that Vl mechanisms is mainly responsible for the border effect. 
In this paper, I propose that the figure-ground and medial axis effects are manifes- 
tations of the border effect, at least for apropriately sized figures. The border effect 
is significant within a limited and finite distance from the figure border. Let us 
call the image region within this finite distance from the border the effective border 
region. When the size of the figure is small enough, all parts of the figure belong 
to the effective border region and can induce higher responses. This suggests that 
the figure-ground effect will be reduced or diminished as the size of the figure be- 
comes larger, and the V1 responses to regions of the figure far away from the border 
will not be significantly higher than responses to background. This suggestion is 
supported by experimental findings (Lamme et al 1997). Furthermore, the border 
effect can create secondary ripples as the effect decays with distance from the bor- 
der. Let us call the distance from the border to the ripple the ripple wavelength. 
When the size of a figure is roughly twice the ripple wavelength, the ripples from 
the two opposite borders of the figure can reinforce each other at the center of the 
figure to create the medial axis effect, which, indeed, is observed to occur only for 
figures of appropriate sizes (Lee et al 1998). 
I validate this proposal using a biologically based model of V1 with intra-cortical 
interactions between cells with nearby but not necessarily overlapping receptive 
fields. Intra-cortical interactions cause the responses of a cell be modulated by 
nearby stimuli outside its classical receptive fields -- the contextual influences that 
are observed physiologically (Knierim and van Essen 1992, Kapadia et al 1995). 
Contextual influences make V1 cells sensitive to global image features, despite their 
local receptive fields, as manifested in the border and other effects. 
2 The V1 model 
We have previously constructed a V1 model and shown it to be able to highlight 
smooth contours against a noisy background (Li 1998, 1999, 1999b) and also the 
boundaries between texture regions in images -- the border effect. Its behavior 
agrees with physiological observations (Knierim and van Essen 1992, Kapadia et 
al 1995) that the neural response to a bar is suppressed strongly by contextual 
bars of similar orientatons -- iso-orientation suppression; that the response is less 
suppressed by orthogonally or randomly oriented contextual bars; and that it is 
enhanced by contextual bars that are aligned to form a smooth contour in which 
the bar is within the receptive field -- contour enhancement. Without loss of 
generality, the model ignores color, motion, and stereo dimensions, includes mainly 
layer 2-3 orientation selective cells, and ignores the intra-hypercolumnar mechanism 
by which their receptive fields are formed. Inputs to the model are images filtered 
by the edge- or bar-like local receptive fields (RFs) of V1 cells.  Cells influence each 
other contextually via horizontal intra-cortical connections (Rockland and Lund 
1983, Gilbert, 1992), transforming patterns of inputs to patterns of cell responses. 
Fig. I shows the elements of the model and their interactions. At each location 
i there is a model V1 hypercolumn composed of K neuron pairs. Each pair (i, 
has RF center i and preferred orientation  - k'/K for k -- 1,2, ...K, and is 
called (the neural representation of) an edge segment. Based on experimental data 
(White, 1989), each edge segment consists of an excitatory and an inhibitory neuron 
that are interconnected, and each model cell represents a collection of local cells of 
similar types. The excitatory cell receives the visual input; its output is used as 
a measure of the response or salience of the edge segment and projects to higher 
visual areas. The inhibitory cells are treated as interneurons. Based on observations

Each grid point i has K neuron pairs (see C), one per bar segment, tuned to 
different orientations 0 spanning 180 �. Two segments at different grid points can 
interact with each other via monosynaptic excitation J (the solid arrow from one 
thick bar to anothe r) or disynaptic inhibition W (the dashed arrow to a thick 
dashed bar). See also C. B: A schematic of the neural connection pattern from the

is directly processed by an interconnected pair of excitatory and inhibitory cells, 
each cell models abstractly a local group of cells of the same type. The excitatory 
cell receives visual input and sends output gx (xio) to higher centers. The inhibitory 
cell is an interneuron. Visual space is taken as having periodic boundary conditions.

more details). Visual input Iis persists after onset, and initializes the activity levels 
gz (xis). The activities are then modified by the contextual influences. Depending on 
the visual input, the system often settles into an oscillatory state (Gray and Singer, 
1989, see the details in Li 1998). Temporal averages of gz (xis) over several oscillation 
cycles are used as the model's output. The nature of the computation performed by 
the model is determined largely by the horizontal connections J and W, which are 
local (spanning only a few hypercolumns), and translation and rotation invariant 
(Fig. XB).
