ABSTRACT 
We have designed, fabricated, and tested a series of compact CMOS 
integrated circuits that realize the winner-take-all function. These 
analog, continuous-time circuits use only O{n) of interconnect to 
perform this function. We have also modified the winner-take-all 
circuit, realizing a circuit that computes local nonlinear inhibition. 
Two general types of inhibition mediate activity in neural systems: subtractive in- 
hibition, which sets a zero level for the computation, and multiplicative (nonlinear) 
inhibition, which regulates the gain of the computation. We report a physical real- 
ization of general nonlinear inhibition in its extreme form, known as winner-take-all. 
We have designed and fabricated a series of compact, completely functional CMOS 
integrated circuits that realize the winner-take-all function, using the full analog 
nature of the medium. This circuit has been used successfully as a component 
in several VLSI sensory systems that perform auditory localization (Lazzaro and 
Mead, in press) and visual stereopsis (Mahowald and Delbruck, 1988). Winner- 
take-all circuits with over 170 inputs function correctly in these sensory systems. 
We have also modified this global winner-take-all circuit, realizing a circuit that 
computes local nonlinear inhibition. The circuit allows multiple winners in the net- 
work, and is well suited for use in systems that represent a feature space topograph- 
ically and that process several features in parallel. We have designed, fabricated, 
and tested a CMOS integrated circuit that computes locally the winner-take-all 
function of spatially ordered input.

THE WINNER-TAKE-ALL CIRCUIT 
Figure 1 is a schematic diagram of the winner-take-all circuit. A single wire, asso- 
ciated with the potential Vc, computes the inhibition for the entire circuit; for an 
n neuron circuit, this wire is O(n) long. To compute the global inhibition, each 
neuron k contributes a current onto this common wire, using transistor T2k. To 
apply this global inhibition locally, each neuron responds to the common wire volt- 
age Vc, using transistor Txk. This computation is continuous in time; no clocks 
are used. The circuit exhibits no hysteresis, and operates with a time constant 
related to the size of the largest input. The output representation of the circuit 
is not binary; the winning output encodes the logarithm of its associated input. 
Figure 1. Schematic diagram of the winner-take-all circuit. Each neuron receives 
a unidirectional current input I; the output voltages Vx... V, represent the result 
of the winner-take-all computation. If I = max(Ix... I,), then V is a logarithmic 
function of I; if I i ' I, then Vi  0. 
A static and dynamic analysis of the two-neuron circuit illustrates these system 
properties. Figure 2 shows a schematic diagram of a two-neuron winner-take-all 
circuit. To understand the behavior of the circuit, we first consider the input 
condition Ix - I2 -- In. Transistors Tx a'd Tx have identical potentials at gate 
and source, and are both sinking I,; thus, the drain potentials Vx and V2 must be 
equal. Transistors T2 and T2 have identical source, drain, and gate potentials, 
and therefore must sink the identical current I -- I 2 - I/2. In the subthreshold 
region of operation, the equation Im- Io exp(Vc/Vo) describes transistors Tx and 
Tx, where Io is a fabrication parameter, and Vo - kT/qr. Likewise, the equation 
Ic/2 - Io exp((Vm- Vc)/Vo), where Vm -- V - V2, describes transistors T2 and 
T2. Solving for V, (I,, I) yields 
= Voln() 
Io + V�ln(2Io '

Thus, for equal input currents, the circuit produces equal output voltages; this 
behavior is desirable for a winner-take-all circuit. In addition, the output voltage 
V, logarithmically encodes the magnitude of the input current I,. 
Figure 2. Schematic diagram of a two-neuron winner-take-all circuit. 
The input condition Ii =Im + 8i, I2 =Im illustrates the inhibitory action of the 
circuit. Transistor Tl must sink 5i more current than in the previous example; as a 
result, the gate voltage of Tx rises. Transistors Tx and Ti2 share a common gate, 
however; thus, Tx must also sink I, + 5i. But only Im is present at the drain of 
T12. To compensate, the drain voltage of Tl, V2, must decrease. For small 5s, the 
Early effect serves to decrease the current through Tx, decreasing V2 linearly with 
i. For large is, Tx must leave saturation, driving V2 to approximately 0 volts. 
As desired, the output associated with the smaller input diminishes. For large 
Ic  O, and Ic  Ic. The equation lm+ 8 = Io exp(V,,/Vo) describes transistor 
Tx,, and the equation = Ioexp((Vx- Vc)/Vo) describes transistor Solving 
for V1 yields 
V1 '-- Voln(Im'i i ) _. Vo ln(/C )

The winning output encodes the logarithm of the associated input. The symmetrical 
circuit topology ensures similar behavior for increases in I2 relative to 
Equation 2 predicts the winning response of the circuit; a more complex expression, 
derived in (Lazzaro et.al., 1989), predicts the losing and crossover response of the 
circuit. Figure 3 is a plot of this analysis, fit to experimental data. Figure 4 shows 
the wide dynamic range and logarithmic properties of the circuit; the experiment in 
Figure 3 is repeated for several values of 12, ranging over four orders of magnitude. 
The conductance of transistors Tlx and Tx2 determines the losing response of the 
circuit. Variants of the winner-take-all circuit shown in (Lazzaro et. al., 1988) 
achieve losing responses wider and narrower than Figure 3, using circuit and mask 
layout techniques.

WINNER-TAKE-ALL TIME RESPONSE 
A good winner-take-all circuit should be stable, and should not exhibit damped 
oscillations ('ringing ) in response to input changes. This section explores these 
dynamic properties of our winner-take-all circuit, and predicts the temporal re- 
sponse of the circuit. Figure 8 shows the two-neuron winner-take-all circuit, with 
capacitances added to model dynamic behavior. 
Figure 8. Schematic diagram of a two-neuron winner-take-all circuit, with capac- 
itances added for dynamic analysis. c is a large MOS capacitor added to each 
neuron for smoothing; co models the parasitic capacitance contributed by the gates 
of T and T12, the drains of T21 and T22, and the interconnect. 
(Lazzaro et. al., 1988) shows a small-signal analysis of this circuit. The transfer 
function for the circuit has real poles, and thus the circuit is stable and does not ring, 
if Io > 4/(�/c), where I  I2  I. Figure 9 compares this bound with experimental 
data. 
If L > 4I(Co/C), the circuit exhibits first-order behavior. The time constant CVo/l 
sets the dynamics of the winning neuron, where Vo = kT/qr  40 mV. The time 
constant cvz/l sets the dynamics of the losing neuron, where vz  50 v. Figure 10 
compares these predictions with experimental data.

THE LOCAL NONLINEAR INHIBITION CIRCUIT 
The winner-take-all circuit in Figure 1, as previously explained, locates the largest 
input to the circuit. Certain applications require a gentler form of nonlinear inhibi- 
tion. Sometimes, a circuit that can represent multiple intensity scales is necessary. 
Without circuit modification, the winner-take-all circuit in Figure 1 can perform 
this task. (Lazzaro et. al., 1988) explains this mode of operation. 
Other applications require a local winner-take-all computation, with each winner 
having influence over only a limited spatial area. Figure 12 shows a circuit that 
computes the local winner-take-all function. The circuit is identical to the original 
winner-take-all circuit, except that each neuron connects to its nearest neighbors 
with a nonlinear resistor circuit (Mead, in press). Each resistor conducts a current 
Ir in response to a voltage AV across it, where L = lotanh(Av/(2Vo)). Io, the 
saturating current of the resistor,
