Abstract 
The dark-adapted visual system can count photons with a reliability lim- 
ited by thermal noise in the rod photoreceptors -- the processing circuitry 
between the rod cells and the brain is essentially noiseless and in fact may 
be close to optimal. Here we design an optimal signal processor which 
estimates the time-varying light intensity at the retina based on the rod 
signals. We show that the first stage of optimal signal processing involves 
passing the rod cell output through a linear filter with characteristics de- 
termined entirely by the rod signal and noise spectra. This filter is very 
general; in fact it is the first, stage in any visual signal processing task 
at, low photon flux. We identifv the output of this first-stage filter with 
the intracellular voltage response of the bipolar cell, the first anatomical 
stage in retinal signal processing. From recent data on tiger salamander 
photoreceptors we extract the relevant spectra and make parameter-free, 
quantitative predictions of the bipolar cell response to a dim, diffuse flash. 
Agreement with experiment is essentially perfect. As far as we know this 
is the first successtiff predictive theory for neural dynamics. 
1 Introduction 
A number of biological sensory cells perform at a level which can be ca, lied optimal 
-- their performance approaches limits set, by the laws of physics [1]. In some cases

the behavioral perforlnance of an orgauism, not just the performance of the sensory 
cells, also approaches fundamental limits. Such performance indicates that neural 
computation can reach a level of precision where the reliability of the computed 
output is linfited by noise in the sensory input rather than by inefficiencies in the 
processing algorithm or noise in the processing hardware [2]. These observations 
suggest that we study algorithms for optimal signal processing. If we can make the 
notiou of optimal processing precise we will have the elements of a predictive (and 
hence unequivocally testable) theory for what the nervous system should compute. 
This is in contrast to traditional modeling approaches which involve adjustment of 
free parameters to fit. experinenta. l data. 
To further develop these ideas we consider the vertebrate retina. Since the classic 
experiments of Hecht, Shlaer and Pirenne we have known that the dark-adapted 
visual system can count small numbers of photons [3]. Recent experiments confirm 
Barlow's suggestion [4,.5] that. the reliability of behavioral decision making reaches 
linfits imposed by dark noise in the photoreceptors due to therlnal isomerization of 
the photopigment [6]. If dark-adapted visual performance is limited by thermal noise 
in the sensory cells then the subsequent layers of signal processing circuitry must be 
extremely reliable. Rather than trying to determine precise limits to reliability, we 
follow the approach introduced in [7] and use the notion of optilnal computation 
to design the optimal processor of visual stimuli. These theoretical argulnents 
result in parameter-free predictions for the dynanfics of signal transfer from the 
rod photoreceptor to the bipolar cell, the first stage in visual signal processing. We 
compare these predictions directly with measurements on the intact retina of the 
tiger salamander Amb:qsloma tigrinum [8,9]. 
2 Design of the optimal processor 
All of an organism's knowledge of the visual world derives from the currents I,(t) 
flowing in the photoreceptor cells (labeled n). Visual signal processing consists of 
estimating various aspects of the visual scene from observation of these currents. 
Furthermore, to be of use to the organism these estimates must be carried out in real 
time. The general problem then is to formulate an optimal strategy for estimating 
solne functional G[R(r,t)] of the time and position dependent photon arrival rate 
R(r, t) from real time observation of the currents In(t). 
We can make considerable aualytic progress towards solving this general problem 
using probabilistic methods [7,2]. Start by writing an expression for/he probability 
of the fuuctional G[R(r,t)] conditional on the currents In(t), P{G[R(r,t)][In(t)}. 
Expanding for low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) we find that the first term in the 
expansion of P{GII} depends only on a filtered version of the rod currents,

characteristics of the photoreceptors, as described below. Thus the estimation task 
divides naturally into two stages -- a universal pre-processingstage and a task- 
dependent stage. The universal stage is independent both of the stimulus R(r, t) and 
of the particular functional G[R] we wish to estimate. Intuitively this separation 
lnakes sense; in conventional signal processing systems detector outputs are first

processed by a filter whose shape is motivated by general SNR considerations. Thus 
the view of retinal signal processing which emerges from this calculation is a pre- 
processing or cleaning up stage followed by more specialized processing stages. 
We emphasize that this separation is a mathematical fact, not, a model we have 
imposed. 
To fill in some of the details of the calculation we turn to the simplest example of 
the estimation tasks discussed above- estimation of the photon arrival rate itself 
(Fig. 1): Photons from a light source are incident on a small patch of retina at 
a time-varying rate R(t), resulting in a current I(t) in a particular rod cell. The 
theoretical problem is to determine the opt, imal strategy for estimating R(I) based 
on the currents I(t) in a small collection of rod cells. With an appropriate defini- 
tion of optimal we can pose the estimation problem mathematically and look for 
analytic or numerical solutions. One approach is the conditional probability calcu- 
lation discussed above [7]. Alternatively we can solve this problem using fimctional 
methods. Here we outline the finct, ional calculation. 
Start by writing the estimated rate as a filtered version of the rod currents: 
Rest(if) 
= /drF(r)I(t- r) 
+ far/dr'F,(r,r')I(t- 
+ ... (2) 
In the low SNR limit the rods respond linearly (they count photons), and we expect, 
that the linear term dominates the series (2). We then solve analytically for the 
filter Fi(r)which minimizes \- = (fdtlR(t) -Rt(t)l '2-) --i.e. the filter which 
satisfies tih-/6F(r ) = 0. The averages {...) are taken over the ensemble of stimuli 
380 Rieke, Owen, and Bialek 
R(t). The result of this optimization is* 
(.3) 
In the photon counting regime the rod currents are described as a sum of impulse 
responses Io(t- tu) occuring at the photon arrival times t, plus a noise term 5I(t). 
Expanding for low SNR we find 
Fl(v) = e SR(w) S + '  (4) 
where Ss(w) is the spectral density of fluctuations iu the photon arrival rate, [0(w) 
is the Fourier transform of Io(t), and 5(w) is the spectral density of current noise 
5I(t) in the rod. 
The filter (4) naturally separates into two distinct stages: A first stage 
Pbip()  f;()/Sl() (5) 
which depends only on [}e signal and noise properties of the rod cell, and a sec- 
ond stage S(w) which contains our a priori knowledge of the stimulus. The first 
stage filter is the matched filter given the rod signal and noise characteristics; each 
frequency component in the output of this filter is weighted according to its input 
SNR. 
Recall from the probabilistic argument above that optimal estimation of some arbi- 
trary aspect of the scene, such as motion, also results in a separation into two pro- 
cessing stages. Specifically, estimation of ang functional of light intensity involves 
only a filtered version of the rod currents. This filter is precisely the universal filter 
Fbip(r) defined in (5). This result makes intnifive sense since the first stage of 
filtering is silnply cleaning up the rod siguals prior to subsequent computation. 
Intuitively we expect that this filtering occurs a an early stage of visual processing. 
The first opportunity [o filter the rod signals occurs in the transfer of signals be- 
tween the rod and bipolar cells; we identi [le transfer function between these cells 
with the first stage of our optimal filter. More precisely we identify the intracellular 
voltage response of the bipolar cell with the output of the filter Fbip(r). In response 
to a diln flash of light at t = 0 the average bipolar cell voltage response should then 
be
