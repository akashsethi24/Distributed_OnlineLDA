Abstract 
We present a theory of cortico-hippocmnpal interaction in discrinination learning. The 
hippocmnpal region is presumed to form new stinulus representations which facilitate 
learning by enhancing the discrininability of predictive stimuli and conpressing 
stimulus-stimulus redundancies. The cortical and cerebellar regions, which are the sites 
of long-term metnory, nay acquire these new representations but m'e not asstuned to be 
capable of forming new representations themselves. Instantiated as a connectionist 
model, this theory accounts for a wide range of trial-level classical conditioning 
phenmnena in normal (intact) and hippocampal-lesioned animals. It also nakes several 
novel predictions which renain to be investigated empirically. The theory implies that 
the hippocmnpal region is involved in even the simplest learning tasks; although 
hippocampal-lesioned animals may be able to use other strategies to learn these tasks, the 
theory predicts that they will show consistently different patterns of transfer and 
generalization when the task demands change. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
It has long been known that the hippocmnpal region (including the entorhinal cortex, 
subiculm' complex, hippocampus and dentate gyrus) plays a role in learning and nemory. 
For example, the hippocampus has been inplicated in hmnan declarative nenory 
(Scoville & Millnet, 1957: Squire, 1987) while hippocampal dmnage in aninals impairs 
such seeningly disparate abilities as spatial mapping (O'Keefe & Nadel, 1978), 
contextual sensitivity (Hirsh, 1974; Winocur, Rawlins & Gray, 1987; Nadel & Willher, 
1980), tenporal processing (Busz'aki. 1989; Akase, Alkon & Disterhoft, 1989), configural 
association (Sutherland & Rudy, 1989) and the flexible use of representations in novel 
situations (Eichenbaum & Buckingham, 1991). Several theories have characterized 
hippocampal function in terms of one or more of these abilities. However, a theory 
which can predict the full range of deficits after hippocampal lesion has been elusive. 
This paper attempts to provide a functional interpretation of a hippocmnpal-region role in 
associative learning. We propose that one function of the hippocampal region is to 
construct new representations which facilitate discrimination lem'ning. We m'gue that this

representational function is sufficient to derive and unify a wide range of trial-level 
condilioned effects observable in the intact and lesioned animal. 
2 A THEORY OF CORTICO-HIPPOCAMPAL INTERACTION 
Psychological theories have often found it useful to characterize stimuli as occupying 
points in an internal representation space (c.f. Shepard. 1958: Nosofsky. 1984). 
Connectionisl theories can be interpreted in a similar geometric framework. For example. 
in a connectionisl network (see Figure IA) a stimulus input such as a tone is recoded in 
the network's inlernal layer as a pattern of activations. A light input will activate a 
different pattern of activations in the internal layer nodes (Figure lB). These internal 
layer activations can be viewed as a representation of the stimulus inputs. and can be 
plotted in multi-dimensional internal represenlalion space (Figure IC). Learning to 
classify stimulus inputs corresponds to finding an appropriate partition of representation 
space. In the connectionist model. the lower layer of network weights determine the 
representation while the upper layer of network weights determine the classification. 
Our basic premise is that the hippocampal region has the ability to modify stnnulus 
representations to facilitate classification, and that its representations are biased by two 
constraints. The first constraint, predictive differentiation, is a bias to differentiate the 
representations of stimuli which are to be classified differently. Predictive differentiation 
increases the representational resources (i.e., hidden units) devoted to representing 
stimulus features which are especially predictive of how a stimulus is to be classified. 
For example, if red stimuli alone should evoke a response. then many representational

representations of stimuli which ought to be classified together lie in the stone partition. 
Classification is easier if the representations of stimuli to be classified together m'e 
clustered while representations of slimuli to be classified differently are widely separated 
in this space. 
Adaptive Stimulus Representations: Computational Theory of Hippocampal-Region Function 
resources should be devoted to encoding color. The second constraint, redundancy 
c9mpression, reduces the resources allocated to represent lealures which are redundmt or 
irrelevant in predicting the desired response. These lwo constraints are bv nature 
complementary. given a finite amount of representational resources. Compressing 
redundant features frees resources lo encode more predictive features. Conversely, 
increasing the resources allocated to predictive features forces compression of the 
remaining (less predictive) features. 
This proposed hippocampal-region function may be modelled by a predictive autoencoder 
(on the right in Figure 2). An autoencoder (Hinton, 1989) learns to map from stimulus 
inputs, through an internal layer. to an output which is a reproduction of those inputs. 
This is also known as stimulus-stimulus learning. To do this, the network must have 
access to some multi-layer teaming algorithm such as error backpropagation (Rumelhart, 
Hinton & Williams, 1986). When the internal layer is narrower than the input and output 
layers. the system develops a recoding in the internal layer which takes advantage of 
redundancies in the inputs. A predictive autoencoder has the further constraint that it 
must also output a classification response to the inputs. This is also known as stimulus- 
response learning. The internal layer recoding must therefore also emphasize stimulus 
features which are especially predictive of this classification. Therefore. a predictive 
autoencoder learns to form internal representations constrained by both predictive 
differentiation and redundancy compression, and is thus an example of a mechanism for 
implementing the two representational biases described above. 
The cerebral and cerebellar cortices form the sites of long term memory in this theory, but 
are not themselves directly able to ibrm new representations. They can, however, acquire 
new representations formed in the hippocampal region. A simplified model of one such 
cerebellar region is shown on the left in Figure 2. This network does not have access to 
multi-layer learning which would allow it to independently form new internal 
representations by itself. Instead. the two layers of weights in this network evolve 
independently. The bottom layer of weights is trained so that the current input pattern 
generates an internal representation equivalent to that developed in the hippocampal 
model. Independently and simultaneously. weights in the cortical network top layer are 
trained to map from this evolving representation to the classification response. Because 
the cortical networks are not creating new representations, but only learning two 
independent single-layer mappings, they can use a much simpler learning rule than the 
hippocampal model. One such algorithm is the LMS learning rule (Widrow & Hoff, 
1960), which can instantiate the Rescorla-Wagner (1972) model of classical conditioning.

3 MODELLING HIPPOCAMPAL 
CLASSICAL CONDITIONING 
INVOLVEMENT IN 
A popular experimental paradigm for the study of associative learning in animals is 
classical conditioning of the rabbit eyeblink response (see Gormezano, Kehoe & 
Mm'shall. 1983. for review). A puff of air delivered to the eye elicits a blink response m 
the rabbit. If a previously neutral stimulus, such as a tone or light (called the conditioned 
stimulus). is repeatedly presented just before the airpuff. the animal will develop a blink 
response to this stimulus -- and time the response so that the lid is maximally closed just 
when the airpuff is scheduled to arrive. Ignoring the many temporal factors -- such as the 
interval between stimuli or precise timing of the response -- this reduces to a 
classification problem: learning which stimuli accurately predict the airpuff and should 
theretore evoke a response. 
During a training trial. both the hippocampal and cortical networks receive the same 
input pattern. This pattern represents
