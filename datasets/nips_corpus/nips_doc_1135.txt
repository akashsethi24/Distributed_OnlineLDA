Abstract 
Despite the phylogenic and structural differences, the visual sys- 
tems of different species, whether vertebrate or invertebrate, share 
certain functional properties. The center-surround opponent recep- 
tive field (CSRF) mechanism represents one such example. Here, 
analogous CSRFs are shown to be formed in an artificial neural 
network which learns to localize contours (edges) of the luminance 
difference. Furthermore, when the input pattern is corrupted by 
a background noise, the CSRFs of the hidden units becomes shal- 
lower and broader with decrease of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). 
The same kind of SNR-dependent plasticity is present in the CSRF 
of real visual neurons; in bipolar cells of the carp retina as is shown 
here experimentally, as well as in large monopolar cells of the fly 
compound eye as was described by others. Also, analogous SNR- 
dependent plasticity is shown to be present in the biphasic flash 
responses (BPFR) of these artificial and biological visual systems. 
Thus, the spatial (CSRF) and temporal (BPFR) filtering proper- 
ties with which a wide variety of creatures see the world appear to 
be optimized for detectability of changes in space and time. 
I INTRODUCTION 
A number of learning algorithms have been developed to make synthetic neural 
machines be trainable to function in certain optimal ways. If the brain and nervous 
systems that we see in nature are best answers of the evolutionary process, then 
one might be able to find some common 'softwares' in real and artificial neural 
systems. This possibility is examined in this paper, with respect to a basic visual

mechanism relevant to detection of brightness contours (edges). In most visual 
systems of vertebrate and invertebrate, one finds interneurons which possess center- 
surround opponent receptive fields (CSRFs). CSRFs underlie the mechanism of 
lateral inhibition which produces edge enhancement effects such as Mach band. It 
has also been shown in the fly compound eye that the CSRF of large monopolar cells 
(LMCs) changes its shape in accordance with SNR; the CSRF becomes wider with 
increase of the noise level in the sensory environment. Furthermore, whereas CSRFs 
describe a filtering function in space, an analogous observation has been made 
in LMCs as regards the filtering property in the time domain; the biphasic flash 
response (BPFR) lasts longer as the noise level increases (Dubs, 1982; Laughlin, 
1982). 
A question that arises is whether similar SNR-dependent spatio-temporal filtering 
properties might be present in vertebrate visual cells. To investigate this, we made 
an intracellular recording experiment to measure the CSRF and BPFR profiles of 
bipolar cells in the carp retina under appropriate conditions, and the results are 
described in the first part of this paper. In the second part, we ask the same 
question in a 3-layer feedforward artificial neural network (ANN) trained to detect 
and localize spatial and temporal changes in simulated visual inputs corrupted by 
noise. In this case, the ANN wiring structure evolves from an initial random state so 
as to minimize the detection error, and we look into the internal ANN organization 
that emerges as a result of training. The findings made in the real and artificial 
neural systems are compared and discussed in the final section. 
In this study, the backpropagation learning algorithm was applied to update the 
synaptic parameters of the ANN. This algorithm was used as a means for the com- 
putational optimization. Accordingly, the present choice is not necessarily relevant 
to the question of whether the error backpropagation pathway actually might exist 
in real neural systems(cf. Stork & Hall, 1989).

THE CASE OF A REAL NEURAL SYSTEM: 
RETINAL BIPOLAR CELL 
Bipolar cells occur as a second order neuron in the vertebrate retina, and they have 
a good example of CSRF Here we are interested in the possibility that the CSRF 
and BPFR of bipolar cells might change their size and shape as a function of the 
visual environment, particularly as regards the dark- versus light-adapted retinal 
states which correspond to low versus high SNR conditions as explained later. Thus, 
the following intracellular recording experiment was carried out. 
2.1 MATERIAL AND METHOD 
The retina was isolated from the carp which had been kept in complete darkness 
for 2 hrs before being pithed for sacrifice. The specimen was then mounted on 
a chamber with the receptor side up, and it was continuously superfused with a 
Ringer solution composed of (in mM) 102 NaCl, 28 NaHCO3, 2.6 KCI, i CaC12, 1 
MgC12 and 5 glucose, maintained at pH=7.6 and aerated with a gas mixture of 95% 
O2 and 5% CO2. Glass micropipettes filled with 3M KC1 and having tip resistances 
of about 150 MR were used to record the membrane potential. Identification of 
bipolar cell units was made on the basis of presence or absence of CSRF. For this 
preliminary test, the center and peripheral responses were examined by using flashes 
of a small centered spot and a narrow annular ring. To map their receptive field 
profile, the stimulus was given as flashes of a narrow slit presented at discrete 
positions 60 pm apart on the retina. The slit of white light was 4 mm long and 0.17 
mm wide, and its flash had intensity of 7.24 pW/cm 2 and duration of 250 msec. 
The CSRF measurement was made under dark- and light- adapted conditions. A

2.2 RESULTS 
Fig. la shows a typical set of records obtained from a bipolar cell. The response 
to each flash of slit was biphasic (i.e., BPFR), consisting of a depolarization (ON) 
followed by a hyperpolarization(OFF). The ON response was the major component 
when the slit was positioned centrally on the receptive field, whereas the OFF 
response was dominant at peripheral locations and somewhat sluggish. The CSRF 
pattern was portrayed by plotting the response membrane potential measured at 
the time just prior to the cessation of each test flash. The result compiled from 
the data of Fig.la is presented in Fig. lb, showing that the CSRF of the dark- 
adapted state was shallow and broad as opposed to the sharp profile produced during 
light adaptation. The records with the slit positioned at the receptive field center 
are enlarged in Fig.lc, indicating that the OFF part of the BPFR waveform was 
shallower and broader when the retina was dark adapted than when light adapted. 
3 THE CASE OF ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS 
Visual pattern recognition and imagery data processing have been a traditional 
application area of ANNs. There are also ANNs that deal with time series signals. 
These both types of ANNs are considered here, and they are trained to detect and 
localize spatial or temporal changes of the input signal corrupted by noise.

3.1 PARADIGMS AND METHODS 
The ANN models we used are illustrated in Figs.2. The model of Fig.2a deals 
with one-dimensional spatial signals. It consists of three layers (input, hidden, 
output), each having the same number of 12 or 20 neuronal units. The pattern 
given to the input layer represents the brightness distribution of light. The network 
was trained by means of the standard backpropagation algorithm, to detect and 
localize step-wise changes (edges) which were distributed on each training pattern 
in a random fashion with respect to the number, position and height. The mean 
level of the whole pattern was varied randomly as well. In addition, there was 
a background noise (not illustrated in Figs.2); independent noise signals of the 
same statistics were given to the all input units, and the maximum noise amplitude 
(NL: noise level) remained constant throughout each training session. The teacher 
signal was the true edge positions which were subject to obscuration due to the 
background noise; the learning was supervised such that each output unit would 
respond with 1 when a step-wise change not due to the background noise occurred 
at the corresponding position, and respond with -1 otherwise. The value of each 
synaptic weight parameter was given randomly at the outset and updated by using 
the backpropagation algorithm after presentation of each training pattern. The 
training session was terminated when the mean square error stopped decreasing. 
To process time series inputs, the ANN model of Fig.2b was constructed with the 
backpropagation learning algorithm. This temporal model also has three layers, 
but the meaning of this is quite different from the spatial network model of Fig.2a. 
That is, whereas each unit of each layer in the spatial model is an anatomical 
entity, this is not the case with respect to the temporal model. Thus, each layer 
represents a single neuron so that there are actually only three neuronal elements, 
i.e., a receptor, an interneuron, and an output cell. And, the units in the same 
layer represent activity states of one neuron at different time slices; the rightmost 
unit for the present time, the next one for one
