Abstract 
We present a hypothesis about how the cerebellum could partici- 
pate in regulating movement in the presence of significant feedback 
delays without resorting to a forward model of the motor plant. We 
show how a simplified cerebellar model can learn to control end- 
point positioning of a nonlinear spring-mass system with realistic 
delays in both afferent and efferent pathways. The model's opera- 
tion involves prediction, but instead of predicting sensory input, it 
directly regulates movement by reacting in an anticipatory fashion 
to input patterns that include delayed sensory feedback. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
The existence of significant delays in sensorimotor feedback pathways has led several 
researchers to suggest that the cerebellum might function as a forward model of the 
motor plant in order to predict the sensory consequences of motor commands before 
actual feedback is available; e.g., (Ito, 1984; Keeler, 1990; Miall et al., 1993). While 
we agree that there are many potential roles for forward models in motor control 
systems, as discussed, e.g., in (Wolpert et al., 1995), we present a hypothesis about 
how the cerebellum could participate in regulating movement in the presence of sig- 
nificant feedback delays without resorting to a forward model. We show how a very 
simplified version of the adjustable pattern generator (APG) model being developed 
by Houk and colleagues (Bertbier et al., 1993; Houk et al., 1995) can learn to con- 
trol endpoint positioning of a nonlinear spring-mass system with significant delays 
in both afferent and efferent pathways. Although much simpler than a multilink 
dynamic arm, control of this spring-mass system involves some of the challenges 
critical in the control of a more realistic motor system and serves to illustrate the 
principles we propose. Preliminary results appear in (Buckingham et al., 1995).

2 NONLINEAR VISCOSITY 
An important aspect of the model is that the plant being contolled has a form of 
nonlineax viscosity, brought about in animals through a combination of muscle and 
spinal reflex properties. To illustrate this, we use a nonlinear spring-mass model 
based on studies of human wrist movement (Wu et al., 1990): 
rnii d- b& d- k(z - Zeq) - 0, (1) 
where � is the position (in meters) of an object of mass ra (kg) attached to the 
spring, Zeq is the resting, or equilibrium, position, b is a damping coefficient, and k 
is the spring's stiffness. Setting rn = 1, b = 4, and k = 60 produces trajectories that 
axe qualitatively similax to those observed in human wrist movement (Wu et al., 
1990). 
This one-fifth power law viscosity gives the system the potential to produce fast 
movements that terminate with little or no oscillation. However, the principle of 
setting the equilibrium position to the desired movement endpoint does not work in 
practice because the system tends to stick at non-equilibrium positions, thereafter 
drifting extremely slowly toward the equilibrium position, eq. We call the position 
at which the mass sticks (which we define as the position at which its absolute 
velocity falls and remains below .005m/s) the endpoint of a movement, denoted 
Thus, endpoint control of this system is not entirely straightforward. The approach 
taken by our model is to switch the value of the control signal, Zeq, at a precisely- 
placed point during a movement. This is similar to virtual trajectory control, except 
that here the commanded equilibrium position need not equal the desired endpoint 
either before or after the switch. 
Panel A of Fig. 1 shows an example of this type of control. The objective is to 
move the mass from an initial position ao - 0 to a target endpoint a, - .05. The 
control signal is the pulse-step shown in the top graph, where a, =. 1 and a, - .04

respectively denote the pulse and step values, and d denotes the pulse duration. 
The mass sticks near the target endpoint z. = .05, which is different from both 
equilibrium positions. If the switch had occurred sooner (later), the mass would 
have undershot (overshot) the target endpoint. 
The bold trajectory in Panel B of Fig. 1 is the phase-plane portrait of this move- 
ment. During its initial phase, the state follows the trajectory that would eventually 
lead to equilibrium position %,. When the pulse ends, the state switches to the tra- 
jectory that would eventually lead to equilibrium position z,, which allows a rapid 
approach to the target endpoint z. - .05, where the mass sticks before reaching z,. 
The dashed line plots pairs of positions and velocities at which the switch should 
occur so that movements starting from different initial states will reach the endpoint 
z. = .05. This switching curve has to vary as a function of the target endpoint. 
3 THE MODEL'S ARCHITECTURE 
The simplified model (Fig. 2) consists of a unit representing a Purkinje cell (PC) 
whose input is derived from a sparse expansive encoding of mossy fiber (MF) input 
representing the target position, z., which remains fixed throughout a movement, 
delayed information about the state of the spring-mass system, and the current 
motor command, Zeq. 1 Patterns of MF activity are recoded to form sparse activity 
patterns over a large number (here 8000) of binary parallel fibers (P's) which 
synapse upon the PC unit, along the lines suggested by Maxx (Marr, 1969) and the 
CMAC model of Albus (Albus, 1971). While some liberties have been taken with 
this representation, the delay distributions are within the range observed for the 
intermediate cerebellum of the monkey (Van Kan et al., 1993). 
Also as in Maxx and Albus, the PC unit is trained by a signal representing the 
activity of a climbing fiber (CF), whose response properties are described below. 
Occasional corrective commands, also discussed below, are assumed to be generated 
x In this model, 256 Gaussian radial basis function (RBF) units represent the target 
position, 400 RBF units represent the position of the mass (i.e., the length of the spring), 
with centers distributed uniformly across an appropriate range of positions and with delays 
distributed according to a Gaussian of mean 15msec and standard deviation 6msec. This 
distribution is truncated so that the minimum delay is 5msec. This delay distribution 
is represented by 'x in Fig. 2. Another 400 RBF units similarly represent mass velocity. 
An additional 4 MF inputs are efference copy signals that simply copy the current motor 
command.

by an extracerebellar system. The PC's output determines the motor command 
through a simple transformation. The model includes an efferent and CF delays, 
both equal to 20msec (r2 and ra, respectively, in Fig. 2). These delays are also 
within the physiological range for these pathways (Gellman et al., 1983). How this 
model is related to the full APG model and its justification in terms of the anatomy 
and physiology of the cerebellum and premotor circuits are discussed extensively 
elsewhere (Bertbier et al., 1993; Houk et al., 1995). 
The PC unit is a linear threshold unit with hysteresis. Let s(t) = Y'4 wi(t)qSi(t), 
where bi(t) denotes the activity of PF i at time t and wi(t) is the weight at time 
step t of the synapse by which PF i influences the PC unit. The output of the PC 
unit at time t, denoted y(t), is the PC's activity state, high or low, at time t, which 
represents a high or a low frequency of simple spike activity. PC activation depends 
on two thresholds: Ohigh and 0to < Ohig. The activity state switches from low 
to high when s(t) > Og, and it switches from high to low when s(t) < to. If 
Oigh = to, the PC unit is the usual linear threshold unit. Although hysteresis is 
not strictly necessary for the control task we present here, it accelerates learning: 
A PC can more easily learn when to switch states than it can learn to maintain 
the correct output on a moment-to-moment basis. The bistability of this PC unit 
is a simplified representation of multistability that could be produced by dendritic 
zones of hysteresis arising from ionic mechanisms (Houk et al., 1995). 
Because PC activity inhibits premotor circuits, PC state low corresponds to the 
pulse phase of the motor command, which sets a far equilibrium position, a,; PC 
state high corresponds to the step pha
