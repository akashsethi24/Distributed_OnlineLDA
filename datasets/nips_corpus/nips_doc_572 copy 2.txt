Abstract 
Recently, high resolution images of the simultaneous representation of 
orientation preference, orientation selectivity and ocular dominance have 
been obtained for large areas in monkey striate cortex by optical imaging 
[1-3]. These data allow for the first time a local as well as global 
description of the spatial patterns and provide strong evidence for corre- 
lations between orientation selectivity and ocular dominance. 
A quantitative analysis reveals that these correlations arise when a five- 
dimensional feature space (two dimensions for retinotopic space, one each 
for orientation preference, orientation specificity, and ocular dominance) is 
mapped into the two available dimensions of cortex while locally preserving 
topology. These results provide strong evidence for the concept of topology 
preserving maps which have been suggested as a basic design principle of 
striate cortex [4-7]. 
Monkey striate cortex contains a retinotopic map in which are embedded the highly 
repetitive patterns of orientation selectivity and ocular dominance. The retinotopic 
projection establishes a global order, while maps of variables describing other 
stimulus features, in particular line orientation and ocularity, dominate cortical 
organization locally. A large number of pattern models [8-12] as well as models 
of development [6,7,13-21] have been proposed to describe the spatial structure of 
these patterns and their development during ontogenesis. However, most models 
have not been compared with experimental data in detail. There are two reasons 
for this: (i) many model-studies were not elaborated enough to be experimentally 
testable and (ii) a sufficient amount of experimental data obtained from large areas 
of striate cortex was not available. 8J

Orientation and ocular dominance columns in monkey 
striate cortex 
Recent advances in optical imaging [1-3,22,23] now make it possible to obtain high 
resolution images of the spatial pattern of orientation selectivity and ocular domi- 
nance from large cortical areas. Prima vista analysis of data from monkey striate 
cortex reveals that the spatial pattern of orientation preference and ocular domi- 
nance is continuous and highly repetitive across cortex. On a global scale orienta- 
tion preferences repeat along every direction of cortex with similar periods. Locally, 
orientation preferences are organized as parallel slabs (arrow 1, Fig. la) in linear 
zones, which start and end at singularities (arrow 2, Fig. la), point-like disconti- 
nuities, around which orientation preferences change by :t:180 � in a pinwheel-like 
fashion. Both types of singularities appear in equal numbers (359:354 for maps 
obtained from four adult macaques) with a density of 5.5/mm 2 (for regions close to

the midline). Figure la reveals that the iso-orientation lines cross ocular dominance 
bands at nearly right angles most of the time (region number 2) and that singular- 
ities tend to align with the centers of the ocular dominance bands (region number 
1). Where orientation preferences are organized as parallel slabs (region number 
2), the iso-orientation contours are often equally spaced and orientation preferences 
change linearly with distance. 
These results are confirmed by a quantitative analysis (see Table 1). For the 
following we denote cortical location by a two-dimensional vector r'. At each lo- 
cation we denote the (average) position of receptive field centroids in visual space 
by (wx(, w2(). Orientation selectivity is described by a two-dimensional vector 
(ws(r, w4(), whose length and direction code for orientation tuning strength and 
preferred orientation, respectively [1,10]. Ocular dominance is described by a real- 
valued function ws(r-'), which denotes the difference in response to stimuli presented 
to the left and right eye. Data acquisition and postprocessing are described in detail 
in [1-3]. 
A Fourier transform of the map of orientation preferences reveals a spectrum which 
is a nearly circular band (Fig. 2a), showing that orientation preferences repeat 
with similar periods in every direction in cortex. Neglecting the slight anisotropy 
in the experimental data , a power spectrum can be approximated by averaging 
amplitudes over all directions of the wave-vector (Fig. 2b, dots. The location of 
the peak corresponds to an average period A0 = 710pm -t- 50pm  and it's width to 
a coherence length of 820pm :t: 130pm. The coherence length indicates the typical 
distance over which orientation preferences can change linearly and corresponds 
to the average size of linear zones in Fig. la. The corresponding autocorrelation 
functions (Fig. 2c) have a Mexican hat shape. The minimum occurs near 300pm, 
which indicates that orientation preferences in regions separated by this distance 
tend to be orthogonal. In summary, the spatial pattern of orientation preference is 
characterized by local correlation and global disorder. 
Along axes parallel to the ocular dominance slabs, orientation preferences repeat on 
average every 660pm 4- 40pro; perpendicular to the stripes every 840pro 4- 40pro. The slight 
horizontal elongation reflects the fact that iso-orientation slabs tend to connect the centers 
of ocular dominance hands.

Local properties of the spatial patterns, as well as correlations between orientation 
preference and ocular dominance, can be quantitatively characterized using Gabor- 
Helstrom-transforms (see Table 1). If the radius tr of the Gaussian function in the 
Gabor-filter is smaller than the coherence length the Gabor-transform of any of the 
quantities wa(, w4( and ws( typically consists of two localized regions of high 
energy located on opposite sides of the origin. The length IFil of the vectors/i, 
i  [3,4, 5], which corresponds to the centroids of these regions, fluctuates around 
the characteristic wave-number 2r/A0 of this pattern, and its direction gives the 
normal to the ocular dominance bands and iso-orientation slabs at the location F, 
where the Gabor-transform was performed.
