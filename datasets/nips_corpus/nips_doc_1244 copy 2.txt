Abstract 
In order to process incoming sounds efficiently, it is advantageous 
for the auditory system to be adapted to the statistical structure of 
natural auditory scenes. As a first step in investigating the relation 
between the system and its inputs, we study low-order statistical 
properties in several sound ensembles using a filter bank analysis. 
Focusing on the amplitude and phase in different frequency bands, 
we find simple parametric descriptions for their distribution and 
power spectrum that are valid for very different types of sounds. 
In particular, the amplitude distribution has an exponential tail 
and its power spectrum exhibits a modified power-law behavior, 
which is manifested by self-similarity and long-range temporal cor- 
relations. Furthermore, the statistics for different bands within a 
given ensemble are virtually identical, suggesting translation in- 
variance along the cochlear axis. These results show that natural 
sounds are highly redundant, and have possible implications to the 
neural code used by the auditory system. 
I Introduction 
The capacity of the auditory system to represent the auditory scene is restricted by 
the finite number of cells and by intrinsic noise. This fact limits the ability of the 
organism to discriminate between different sounds with similar spectro-temporal

characteristics. However, it is possible to enhance the discrimination ability by 
a suitable choice of the encoding procedure used by the system, namely of the 
transformation of sounds reaching the cochlea to neural spike trains generated in 
successive processing stages in response to these sounds. In general, the choice of 
a good encoding procedure requires knowledge of the statistical structure of the 
sound ensemble. 
For the visual system, several investigations of the statistical properties of image 
ensembles and their relations to neuronal response properties have recently been 
performed (Field 1987, Atick and Redlich 1990, Ruderman and Bialek 1994). In 
particular, receptive fields of retinal ganglion and LGN cells were found to be consis- 
tent with an optimal-code prediction formulated within information theory (Atick 
1992, Dong and Atick 1995), suggesting that the visual periphery may be designed 
as to take advantage of simple statistical properties of visual scenes. 
In order to investigate whether the auditory system is similarly adapted to the 
statistical structure of its own inputs, a good characterization of auditory scenes is 
necessary. In this paper we take a first step in this direction by studying low-order 
statistical properties of several sound ensembles. The quantities we focus on are 
the spectro-temporal amplitude and phase defined as follows. For the sound s(t), 
let sv(t) denote its components at the set of frequencies , obtained by filtering it 
through a bandpass filter bank centered at those frequencies. Then 
sv(t) = x(t)cos + 
(1) 
where x(t) _> 0 and q(t) are the spectro-temporal amplitude (STA) and phase 
(STP), respectively. A complete characterization of a sound ensemble with respect 
to a given filter bank must be given by the joint distribution of amplitudes and 
phases at all times, p(xv (t),q (t),...,x (t),q (t)). In this paper, however, 
we restrict ourselves to second-order statistics in the time domain and examine the 
distribution and power spectrum of the stochastic processes x (t) and qv (t). 
Note that the STA and STP are quantities directly relevant to auditory processing. 
The different stages of the auditory system are organized in topographic frequency 
maps, so that cells tuned to the same sound frequency u are organized in stripes 
perpendicular to the direction of frequency progression (see, e.g., Pickles 1988). 
The neuronal responses are thus determined by x and q, and by x alone when 
phase-locking disappears above 4-5KHz. 
2 Methods 
Since it is difficult to obtain a reliable sample of an animal's auditory scene over a 
sufficiently long time, we chose instead to analyze several different sound ensembles, 
each consisting of a 15rain sound of a certain type. We used cat vocalizations, bird 
songs, wolf cries, environmental sounds, symphonic music, jazz, pop music, and 
speech. The sounds were obtained from commercially available compact discs and 
from recordings of amimal vocalizations in two laboratories. No attempt has been 
made to manipulate the recorded sounds in any way (e.g., by removing noise). 
Each sound ensemble was loaded into the computer by 30sec segments at a sam- 
pling rate of f8 = 44.1KHz. After decimating to rs/2, we performed the follow- 
ing frequency-band analysis. Each segment was passed through a bandpass fil-

sv(t) = s(t) ï¿½ h(t). We used square, non-overlapping filters with center frequen- 
cies y logarithmically spaced within the range of 100 - 11025Hz. The filters were 
usually 1/8-octave wide, but we experimented with larger bandwidths as well. The 
amplitude and phase in band y were then obtained via the Hilbert transform

The frequency content of x is bounded by 0 and by the bandwidth of h (Flanagan 
1980), so keeping the latter below y guarantees that the low frequencies in s are 
all contained in x, confirming its interpretation as the amplitude modulator of 
the carrier cos yt suggested by (1). The phase bv, being time-dependent, produces 
frequency modulation. For a given y the results were averaged over all segments. 
3 Amplitude Distribution 
We first examined the STA distribution in different frequency bands y. Fig. 1 
presents historgrams of p(log10 x) on a logarithmic scale for four different sound 
ensembles. In order to facilitate a comparison among different bands and ensembles, 
we normalized the variable to have zero mean and unit variance, (log10 x(t)) = 
0, ((log0 x(t)) ') = 1, corresponding to a linear gain control.

ensembles, using n - 1, 20, 50,100,200. The speech ensemble is different from the 
one used in Fig. 1. 
As shown in the figure, within a given ensemble, the histograms corresponding to 
different bands lie atop one another. Furthermore, although curves from different 
ensembles are not identical, we found that they could all be fitted accurately to the 
same parametric functional form, given by 
p(xv) or (b -F x2) /' (3) 
with parameter values roughly in the range of 0.1 _< ? _ 1, 0 <_ / _< 2.5, and 
0.1 _< b0 _< 0.6. In some cases, a mixture of two distributions of the form (3) was 
necessary, suggesting the presence of two types of sound sources; see, e.g., the slight 
bimodality in the lower parts of Fig. 1. Details of the fitting procedure will be given 
in a longer paper. We found the form (3) to be preserved as the filter bandwidths 
increased. 
Whereas this distribution decays exponentially fast at high amplitudes (p or 
e-VX/xg), it does not vanish at low amplitudes, indicating a finite probability 
for the occurence of arbitrarily soft sounds. In contrast, the STA of a Gaussian 
noise signal can be shown to be distributed according to p or xve-XX, which van- 
ishes at x - 0 and decays faster than (3) at large x. Hence, the origin of the large 
dynamic range usually associated with audio signals can be traced to the abundance 
of soft sounds rather than of loud ones. 
4 Amplitude Self-Similarity 
An interesting probe of the STA temporal correlations is the property of scale 
invariance (also called statistical self-similarity). The process x (t) is scale-invariant 
when any statistical quantity on a given scale (e.g., at a given temporal resolution, 
determined by the sampling rate) does not change as that scale is varied. To 
observe this property we examined the STA distribution p(x) at different temporal 
resolutions, by defining the n-point averaged amplitude

rithmic scale, using n = 1, 20, 50,100,200 which correspond to a temporal resolution 
range of 0.75 - 150msec. Remarkably, the histogram remains unmodified even for 
n = 200. Had the xv (t q- kA) been statistically independent variables, the central 
limit theorem would have predicted a Gaussian p(x( )) for large n. The fact that 
this non-Gaussian distribution preserves its form as n increases implies the presence 
of temporal STA correlations over long periods.
