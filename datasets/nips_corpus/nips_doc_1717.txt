Abstract 
We study a population decoding paradigm in which the maximum likeli- 
hood inference is based on an unfaithful decoding model (UMLI). This 
is usually the case for neural population decoding because the encoding 
process of the brain is not exactly known, or because a simplified de- 
coding model is preferred for saving computational cost. We consider 
an unfaithful decoding model which neglects the pair-wise correlation 
between neuronal activities, and prove that UMLI is asymptotically effi- 
cient when the neuronal correlation is uniform or of limited-range. The 
performance of UMLI is compared with that of the maximum likelihood 
inference based on a faithful model and that of the center of mass de- 
coding method. It turns out that UMLI has advantages of decreasing 
the computational complexity remarkablely and maintaining a high-level 
decoding accuracy at the same time. The effect of correlation on the 
decoding accuracy is also discussed. 
1 Introduction 
Population coding is a method to encode and decode stimuli in a distributed way by us- 
ing the joint activities of a number of neurons (e.g. Georgopoulos et al., 1986; Paradiso, 
1988; Seung and Sompolinsky, 1993). Recently, there has been an expanded interest in 
understanding the population decoding methods, which particularly include the maximum 
likelihood inference (MLI), the center of mass (COM), the complex estimator (CE) and the 
optimal linear estimator (OLE) [see (Pouget et al., 1998; Salinas and Abbott, 1994) and the 
references therein]. Among them, MLI has an advantage of having small decoding error 
(asymptotic efficiency), but may suffers from the expense of computational complexity. 
Let us consider a population of N neurons coding a variable c. The encoding process 
of the population code is described by a conditional probability q(rlx ) (Anderson, 1994; 
Zemel et al., 1998), where the components of the vector r = {ri) for i = 1,-.-, N are 
the firing rates of neurons. We study the following MLI estimator given by the value of 
c that maximizes the log likelihood lnp(rlc), where p(rlc ) is the decoding model which 
might be different from the encoding model q(rlc ). So far, when people study MLI in a 
population code, it normally (or implicitly) assumes that p(rlc ) is equal to the encoding 
model q(rlc ). This requires that the estimator has full knowledge of the encoding process. 
Taking account of the complexity of the information process in the brain, it is more natural 
Population Decoding Based on an Unfaithful Model 193 
to assume p(r[x)  q(rlx). Another reason for choosing this is for saving computational 
cost. Therefore, a decoding paradigm in which the assumed decoding model is different 
from the encoding one needs to be studied. In the context of statistical theory, this is called 
estimation based on an unfaithful or a misspecified model. Hereafter, we call the decoding 
paradigm of using MLI based on an unfaithful model, UMLI, to distinguish from that of 
MLI based on the faithful model, which is called FMLI. The unfaithful model studied in 
this paper is the one which neglects the pair-wise correlation between neural activities. It 
turns out that UMLI has attracting properties of decreasing the computational cost of FMLI 
remarkablely and at the same time maintaining a high-level decoding accuracy. 
2 The Population Decoding Paradigm of UMLI 
2.1 An Unfaithful Decoding Model of Neglecting the Neuronal Correlation 
Let us consider a pair-wise correlated neural response model in which the neuron activities 
are assumed to be multivariate Gaussian 
1 exp[ 1 
q(rlx) = V/(27ra2)N det(A) --2a E A l(ri - fi(x))(D - fj(x))], (1) 
i,j 
where fi(:c) is the tuning function. In the present study, we will only consider the radial 
symmetry tuning function. 
Two different correlation structures are considered. One is the uniform correlation model 
(Johnson, 1980; Abbott and Dayan, 1999), with the covariance matrix 
A 0 =60+c(1-60), (2) 
where the parameter c (with - 1 < c < 1) determines the strength of correlation. 
The other correlation structure is of limited-range (Johnson, 1980; Snippe and Koenderink, 
1992; Abbott and Dayan, 1999), with the covariance matrix 
Aij = b li-jl, (3) 
where the parameter b (with 0 < b < 1) determines the range of correlation. This structure 
has translational invariance in the sense that Aij = Akt, if 
The unfaithful decoding model, treated in the present study, is the one which neglects the 
correlation in the encoding process but keeps the tuning functions unchanged, that is,

p(rlx) = V/(27rrr2) N -2a i 
2.2 The decoding error of UMLI and FMLI 
The decoding error of UMLI has been studied in the statistical theory (Akahira and 
Takeuchi, 1981; Murata et al., 1994). Here we generalize it to the population cod- 
ing. For convenience, some notations are introduced. Vf(r, x) denotes df(r,c)/dc. 
Eq[f(r,x)] and Vq[f(r,x)] denote, respectively, the mean value and the variance of 
f(r, x) with respect to the distribution q(rl:c ). Given an observation of the population 
activity r*, the UMLI estimate : is the value of :c that maximizes the log likelihood 
Lp(r*,x) = lnp(r*lx ). 
Denote by Xop t the value of x satisfying Eq[VLp(r, Xopt) ] = 0. For the faithful model 
where p: q, Xop t = x. Hence, (Xop t - x) is the error due to the unfaithful setting, 
whereas (: - Xopt) is the error due to sampling fluctuations. For the unfaithful model (4), 
194 S. Wu, H. Nakahara, N. Murata and S. Amari 
since Eq[VLp(r, xopt)]: O, �]i[fi(x) - fi(xopt)]f'(Xopt): O. Hence, Xop t: x and 
UMLI gives an unbiased estimator in the present cases. 
Let us consider the expansion of VLp (r*, ) at x, 
VLp(r*,) _ VLp(r*,x) + VVLp(r*,x) ( - x). 
Since VLv(r* , ) = O,

N 7Lp (r*, x), (6) 
where N is the number of neurons. Only the large N limit is considered in the present 
study. 
Let us analyze the properties of the two random variables VVLp(r*,x) and 
VLp(r*, z). We consider first the uniform correlation model. 
For the uniform correlation structure, we can write 
ri - fi(x) + (i q- T]), (7) 
where r/and {ei}, for i = 1,..., N, are independent random variables having zero mean 
and variance c and 1 - c, respectively. r/is the common noise for all neurons, representing 
the uniform character of the correlation. 
By using the expression (7), we get

VLp(r*,x) = No

X77Lp(r*,x) =

(9) 
Without loss of generality, we assume that the distribution of the preferred stimuli is uni- 
form. For the radial symmetry tuning functions,  �]i f/(x) and  Y]i f'(x) approaches 
zero when N is large. Therefore, the correlation contributions (the terms of r/) in the above 
two equations can be neglected. UMLI performs in this case as if the neuronal signals are 
uncorrelated. 
Thus, by the weak law of large numbers,

Population Decoding Based on an Unfaithful Model 195 
Combining the results of eqs.(6), (10) and (11), we obtain the decoding error of UMLI, 
(: - X)UML I ,-, N(0, Q;2Gv) , 
(1 -c)a 2 
= N(0,  f?/-5 )' (12) 
In the similar way, the decoding error of FMLI is obtained, 
(-X)FL I  V(0, 
= V(0, ( - c)� 
y.i f(x)2 ) , (13) 
which has the same form as that of UMLI except that Qq and G are now defined with 
respect to the faithful decoding model, i.e., p(rlz ) = q(rlz ). To get eq.(13), the condition 
Y'i f(z) = 0 is used. Interestingly, UMLI and FMLI have the same decoding error. This 
is because the uniform correlation effect is actually neglected in both UMLI and FMLI. 
Note that in FMLI, (q -- (]q -- Vq[VLq(rlx)] is the Fisher information. (-2Gq is the 
Cram(r-Rao bound, which is the optimal accuracy for an unbiased estimator to achieve. 
Eq.(13) shows that FMLI is asymptotically efficient. For an unfaithful decoding model, 
Qp and Gp are usually different from the Fisher information. We call Q;2Gp the gen- 
eralized Cram(r-Rao bound, and UMLI quasi-asymptotically efficient if its decoding error 
approaches Q-2Gp asymptotically. Eq.(12) shows that UMLI is quasi-asymptotic efficient. 
In the above, we have proved the asymptotic efficiency of FMLI and UMLI when the neu- 
ronal correlation is uniform. The result relies on the radial symmetry of the tuning function 
and the uniform character of the correlation, which make it possible to cancel the corre- 
lation contributions from different neurons. For general tuning functions and correlation 
structures, the asymptotic efficiency of UMLI and FMLI may not hold. This is because the 
law of large numbers (eq.(10)) and the central limit theorem (eq.(11)) are not in general 
applicable. 
We note that for the limited-range correlation model, since the correlation is translational 
invariant and its strength decreases quickly with the dissimilarity in the neurons' preferred 
stimuli, the correlation effect in the decoding of FMLI and UMLI becomes negligible when 
N is large. This ensures that the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem hold 
in the large N limit. Therefore, UMLI and FMLI are asymptotically efficient. This is 
confirmed in the simulation in Sec.3. 
When UMLI and FMLI are asymptotic efficient, their decoding errors in the large N limit 
can be calculated according to the Cram6r-Rao bound and the generalized Cram(r-Rao 
bound, respectively, which are
