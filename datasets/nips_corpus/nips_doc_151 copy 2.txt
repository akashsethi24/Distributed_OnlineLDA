ABSTRACT 
The barn owl has fused visual/auditory/motor representations of 
space in its midbrain which are used to orient the head so that visu- 
al or auditory stimuli are centered in the visual field of view. We 
present models and computer simulations of these structures which 
address various problems, includi. g. the construction of a map of 
space from auditory sensory info'lation, and the problem of driv- 
ing the motor system from these maps. We compare the results 
with biological data. 
INTRODUCTION 
Many neural network models have little resemblance to real neural structures, part- 
ly because the brain's higher functions, which they attempt to imitate, are not yet 
experimentally accessible. Nevertheless, some neural-net researchers are finding that 
the accessible structures are interesting, and that their functions are potentially use- 
ful. Our group is modeling a part of the barn owl's nervous system which orients 
the head to visual and auditory stimuli. 
The barn owl's brain stem and midbrain contains a system that locates visual and 
auditory stimuli in space. The system constructs an auditory map of spatial direction 
from the non-spatial information in the output of the two cochlea. This map is in 
the external nucleus of the inferior colliculus, or ICx [Knudsen and Konishi, 1978]. 
The ICx, along with the visual system, projects to the optic tectum, producing a 
fused visual and auditory map of space [Knudsen and Knudsen, 1983]. The map in the 
tectum is the sotace of target position used by the motor system for orienting the 
head. 
In the last fifteen years, biologists have determined all of the structures in the sys- 
tem which produces the auditory map of space in the ICx. This system provides sev-

eral examples of neuronal maps, regions of tissue in which the response properties 
of neurons vary continuously with position in the map. (For reviews, see Knudsen, 
1984; Knudsen, du Lac, and Estedy, 1987; and Konishi, 1986.) Unfortunately, the 
motor system and the projections from the rectum are not well known, but experi- 
mental study of them has recently begun [Masino and Knudsen, 1988]. We should 
eventually be able to model a complete system, from sensory input to motor output. 
In this paper we present several models of different parts of the head orientation sys- 
tem. Fig. 1 is an overview of the stmcmre we'll discuss. In the second section of 
this paper we discuss models for the construction of the auditory space map in the 
ICx. In the third section we discuss how the optic tectum might drive the motor 
system. 
CONSTRUCTION OF AN AUDITORY MAP OF SPACE 
The barn owl uses two binaural cues to locate objects in space: azimuth is derived 
from inter-aural time or phase delay (not onset time difference), while elevation is 
derived from inter-aural intensity difference (due to vertical asymmetries in sensitiv-

ity). Corresponding to these two cues are two separate processing streams which pro- 
duce maps of the binaural cues, which are shown in Figs. 2-5. The information on 
these maps must be merged in order to construct the map of space in the ICx.

Intensity Difference, ITD is Inter-aural Time Delay. 
A simple model for combining the two maps is shown in Fig. 2. It has not been 
described explicitly in the literature, but it has been hinted at [Knudsen, et al, 
1987]. For this reason we have called it the standard model. Here all of the neurons 
representing a given time delay or azimuth in the ITD vs. frequency map project to 
all of the neurons representing that azimuth in the space map. Thus a stimulus with 
a certain ITD would excite a strip of cells representing the associated azimuth and 
all elevations. Similarly, all of the neurons representing a given intensity difference 
or elevation in the lid vs. frequency map project to all of the neurons representing 
that elevation in the space map. (The map of IID vs. frequency is constructed in the 
nucleus ventralis lemnisci lateralis pars posterior, or VLVp. VLVp neurons are said 
to be sensitive to intensity difference, that is they fire if the intensity difference is 
great enough. Neurons in the VLVp are spatially organized by their intensity differ- 
ence threshold [Manley, et al, 1988]. Thus, intensity difference has a bar-chart-like 
representation, and our model needs some mechanism to pick out the ends of the 
bars.) Only the neurons at the intersection of the two strips will fire if lateral inhi- 
bition allows only those neurons receiving the most stimulation to fire. In the third 
section we will present a model for connections of inhibitory inter-neurons which 
can be applied to this model. 
Part of the motivation for the standard model is the problem with phase ghosts. 
Phase ghosts occur when the barn owl's nervous system incorrectly associates the 
wave fronts arriving at the two ears at high frequency. In this case, neurons in the 
map of ITD vs. frequency become active at locations representing a time delay which 
Neuronal Maps for Sensory-Motor Control in the Barn Owl 369 
differs from the true time delay by an integer multiple of the period of the sound. 
Because the period varies inversely with the frequency, these phase ghosts will have 
apparent time delays that vary with frequency. Thus, for stimuli that are not pure 
tones, ff the barn owl can compare the activities in the map at different frequencies, 
it can eliminate the ghosts. The standard model does this (Fig. 2). In the ITD vs. fre- 
quency map there are more neurons firing at the position of the true ITD than at the 
ghost positions, so space map neurons representing the true position will receive the 
most stimulation. Only those neurons representing the true position will fire 
because of the lateral inhibition. 
There is another kind of ghost which we call the multiple-source ghost (Fig. 3). If 
two sounds occur simultaneously, then space map neurons representing the time 
delay of one source and the intensity difference of the other will receive a large 
amount of stimulation. Lateral inhibition may suppress these ghosts, but if so, the 
owl should only be able to locate one source at a time. In addition, the true sources 
might be suppressed. The barn owl may actually suffer from this problem, although 
it seems unlikely if the owl has to function in a noisy environment. The relevant 
behavioral experiments have not yet been done. 
Experimental evidence does not support the standard model. The ICx receives most 
of its input from the lateral shell of the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus

the auditory space map. For clarity, only two pure tone stimuli are represented, 
and their frequencies and locations are such that the phase ghost problem is 
not a factor. The black squares represent regions of cells that are above thresh- 
old. The circled regions are those that are f'ffing in response to the ITD of one 
stimulus and the IID of another. These regions correspond to phantom targets.

(lateral shell of the ICc) [Knudsen, 1983]. Neurons in the lateral shell are tuned to 
frequency and time delay, and these parameters are mapped [Wagner, Takahashi, and 
Konishi, 1987]. However, they are also affected by intensity difference [Knudsen and 
Konishi, 1978, I. Fujita, private communication]. Thus the lateral shell does not fit 
the picture of the input to the ICx in the standard model, rather it is some interme- 
diate stage in the processing. 
We have a model, called the lateral shell model, which does not suffer from multi- 
pie-source ghosts (Fig. 4). In this model, the lateral shell of the ICc is a three- 
dimensional map of frequency vs. intensity difference vs. time delay. A neuron in 
the map of time delay vs. frequency in the ICc core projects to all of the neurons in

the stand_a_rd model, a strip of neurons is stimulated, but now the frequency tuning 
is preserved. The map of intensity difference vs. frequency in the nucleus ventralis 
lemnisci lateralis pars posterior (VLVp) [Manley, et al, 1988] projects to the three- 
dimensional map in a similar fashion. Lateral inhibition picks out the regions of 
intersection of the strips. Neurons in the space map in the ICx receive input from 
the strip of neurons in the three-dimensional map which represent the appropriate
