Abstract 
In the electrosensory system of weakly electric fish, descending 
pathways to a first-order sensory nucleus have been shown to influ- 
ence the gain of its output neurons. The underlying neural mecha- 
nisms that subserve this descending gain control capability are not 
yet fully understood. We suggest that one possible gain control 
mechanism could involve the regulation of total membrane conduc- 
tance of the output neurons. In this paper, a neural model based 
on this idea is used to demonstrate how activity levels on descend- 
ing pathways could control both the gain and baseline excitation 
of a target neuron. 
I INTRODUCTION 
Certain species of freshwater tropical fish, known as weakly electric fish, possess an 
active electric sense that allows them to detect and discriminate objects in their 
environment using a self-generated electric field (Bullock and Heiligenberg, 1986). 
They detect objects by sensing small perturbations in this electric field using an 
array of specialized receptors, known as electroreceptors, that cover their body sur- 
face. Weakly electric fish often live in turbid water and tend to be nocturnal. These 
conditions, which hinder visual perception, do not adversely affect the electric sense. 
Hence the electrosensory system allows these fish to navigate and capture prey in 
total darkness in much the same way as the sonar system of echolocating bats allows 
them to do the same. A fundamental difference between bat echolocation and fish

electrolocation is that the propagation of the electric field emitted by the fish is 
essentially instantaneous when considered on the time scales that characterize ner- 
vous system function. Thus rather than processing echo delays as bats do, electric 
fish extract information from instantaneous amplitude and phase modulations of 
their emitted signals. 
The electric sense must cope with a wide range of stimulus intensities because the 
magnitude of electric field perturbations varies considerably depending on the size, 
distance and impedance of the object that gives rise to them (Bastian, 1981a). 
The range of intensities that the system experiences is also affected by the con- 
ductivity of the surrounding water, which undergoes significant seasonal variation. 
In the electrosensory system, there are no peripheral mechanisms to compensate 
for variations in stimulus intensity. Unlike the visual system, which can regulate 
the intensity of light arriving at photoreceptors by adjusting pupil diameter, the 
electrosensory system has no equivalent means for directly regulating the overall 
stimulus strength experienced by the electroreceptors, x and unlike the auditory 
system, there are no efferent projections to the sensory periphery to control the 
gain of the receptors themselves. The first opportunity for the electrosensory sys- 
tem to make gain adjustments occurs in a first-order sensory nucleus known as the 
electrosensory lateral line lobe (ELL). 
In the ELL, primary afferent axons from peripheral electroreceptors terminate on 
the basal dendrites of a class of pyramidal cells referred to as E-cells (Maler et 
al., 1981; Bastian, 1981b), which represent a subset of the output neurons for the 
nucleus. These pyramidal cells also receive descending inputs from higher brain 
centers on their apical dendrites (Maler et al., 1981). One noteworthy feature is 
that the descending inputs are massive, far outnumbering the afferent inputs in total 
number of synapses. Experiments have shown that the E-cells, unlike peripheral 
electroreceptors, maintain a relatively constant response amplitude to electrosensory 
stimuli when the overall electric field normalization is experimentally altered. This 
automatic gain control capability is lost, however, when descending input to the ELL 
is blocked (Bastian, 1986ab). The underlying neural mechanisms that subserve this 
descending gain control capability are not yet fully understood, although it is known 
that GABAergic inhibition plays a role (Shumway & Maler, 1989). We suggest that 
one possible gain control mechanism could involve the regulation of total membrane 
conductance of the pyramidal cells. In the next section we present a model based 
on this idea and show how activity levels on descending pathways could regulate 
both the gain and baseline excitation of a target neuron.

NEURAL CIRCUITRY FOR DESCENDING GAIN 
CONTROL 
Figure i shows a schematic diagram of neural circuitry that could provide the basis 
for a descending gain control mechanism. This circuitry is inspired by the circuitry 
found in the ELL, but has been greatly simplified to retain only the aspects that 
In principle, this could be achieved by regulating the strength of the fish's own electric 
discharge. However, these fish maintain a remarkably stable discharge amplitude and such 
a mechanism has never been observed.

Figure 1: Neural circuitry for descending gain control. The gain of the pyramidal 
cell response to an input signal arriving on its basilar dendrite can be controlled 
by adjusting the tonic levels of activity on two descending pathways. A descending 
excitatory pathway makes excitatory synapses (open circles) directly on the pyra- 
midal cell. A descending inhibitory pathway acts through an inhibitory interneuron

are essential for the proposed gain control mechanism. The pyramidal cell receives 
afferent input on a basal dendrite and control inputs from two descending pathways. 
One descending pathway makes excitatory synaptic connections directly on the 
apical dendrite of the pyramidal cell, while a second pathway exerts a net inhibitory 
effect on the pyramidal cell by acting through an inhibitory interneuron. We will 
show that under appropriate conditions, the gain of the pyramidal cell's response 
to an input signal arriving on its basal dendrite can be controlled by adjusting 
the tonic levels of activity on the two descending pathways. At this point it is 
worth pointing out that the spatial segregation of input and control pathways onto 
different parts of the dendritic tree is not an essential feature of the proposed gain 
control mechanism. However, by allowing independent experimental manipulation 
of these two pathways, this segregation has played a key role in the discovery and 
subsequent characterization of the gain control function in this system (Bastian, 
1986ab). 
The gain control function of the neural circuitry show in Figure 1 can best be un- 
derstood by considering an electrical equivalent circuit for the pyramidal cell. The 
equivalent circuit shown in Figure 2 includes only the features that are necessary 
to understand the gain control function and does not reflect the true complexity of 
ELL pyramidal cells, which are known to contain many different types of voltage- 
dependent channels (Mathieson & Maler, 1988). The passive electrical properties 
of the circuit in Figure 2 are described by a membrane capacitance C,,, a leak- 
age conductance geak, and an associated reversal potential E,ak. The excitatory 
descending pathway directly activates excitatory synapses on the pyramidal cell, 
giving rise to an excitatory synaptic conductance gex with a reversal potential

Figure 2: Electrical equivalent circuit for the pyramidal cell in the gain control 
circuit. The excitatory and inhibitory conductances, g,x and gi,h, are shown are 
variable resistances to indicate that their steady-state values are dependent on the 
activity levels of the descending pathways. 
The inhibitory descending pathway acts by exciting a class of inhibitory interneu- 
rons which in turn activate inhibitory synapses on the pyramidal cell with inhibitory 
conductance gin and reversal potential Elna. In this model, the excitatory and in- 
hibitory conductances g,x and girth represent the population conductances of all 
the individual excitatory and inhibitory synapses associated with the descending 
pathways. Although individual synaptic events give rise to a time-dependent con- 
ductance change (which is often modeled by an ( function), we consider the regime 
in which the activity levels on the descending pathways, the number of synapses 
involved, and the synaptic time constants are such that the summed effect can be 
well described by a single time-invariant conductance value for each pathway. The 
input signal (the one under the influence of the gain control mechanism) is modeled 
in a general form as a time-dependent current I(t). This current can represent ei- 
ther the synaptic current arising from activation of synapses in the primary afferent 
pathway, or it can represent direct current injection into the cell, such as might 
occur in an intracellular recording experiment.
