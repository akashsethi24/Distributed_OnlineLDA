ABSTRACT 
Interneurons in leech ganglia receive multiple sensory inputs and make 
synaptic contacts with many motor neurons. These hidden units 
coordinate several different behaviors. We used physiological and 
anatomical constraints to construct a model of the local bending reflex. 
Dynamical networks were trained on experimentally derived input-output 
patterns using recurrent back-propagation. Units in the model were 
modified to include electrical synapses and multiple synaptic time 
constants. The properties of the hidden units that emerged in the 
simulations matched those in the leech. The model and data support 
distributed rather than 1ocalist representations in the local bending reflex. 
These results also explain counterintuitive aspects of the local bending 
circuitry. 
INTRODUCTION 
Neural network modeling techniques have recently been used to predict and analyze the 
connectivity of biological neural circuits (Zipser and Andersen, 1988; Lehky and 
Sejnowski, 1988; Anastasio and Robinson, 1989). Neurons are represented as simplified 
processing units and arranged into model networks that are then trained to reproduce the 
input-output function of the reflex or brain region of interest. After training, the 
receptive and projecfive field of hidden units in the network often bear striking similarities 
to actual neurons and can suggest functional roles of neurons with inputs and outputs that 
are hard to grasp intuitively. We applied this approach to the local bending reflex of the 
leech, a three-layered, feed-forward network comprising a small number of identifiable

neurons whose connectivity and input-output function have been determined 
physiologically. We found that model local bending networks trained using recurrent 
back-propagation (Pineda, 1987; Pearlmutter, 1989) to reproduce a physiologically 
determined input-output function contained hidden units whose connectivity and temporal 
response properties closely resembled those of identified neurons in the biological 
network. The similarity between model and actual neurons suggested that local bending 
is produced by distributed representations of sensory and motor information. 
THE LOCAL BENDING REFLEX 
In response to a mechanical stimulus, the leech withdraws from the site of contact (Fig. 
la). This is accomplished by contraction of longitudinal muscles beneath the stimulus 
and relaxation of longitudinal muscles on the opposite side of the body, resulting in a U- 
shaped local bend (Kristan, 1982). The form of the response is independent of the site of 
stimulation: dorsal, ventral, and lateral stimuli produce an appropriately oriented

Figure 1: a. Local bending behavior. Partial view of a leech in the resting position 
and in response to dorsal, ventral, and lateral stimuli. b. Local bending circuit. The main 
input to the reflex is provided by the dorsal and ventral P cells (PD and PV). Control of 
local bending is largely provided by motor neurons whose field of innervation is restricted 
to single left-right, dorsal-ventral quadrants of the body; dorsal and ventral quadrants are 
innervated by both excitatory (DE and VE) and inhibitory (DI and VI) motor neurons. 
Motor neurons are connected by electrical and chemical synapses. Sensory input to motor 
neurons is mediated by a layer of interneurons. Interneurons that were excited by PD and 
which in turn excite DE have been identified (hatched); other types of interneurons 
remain to be identified (open).

withdrawal. Major input to the local bending reflex is provided by four pressure sensitive 
mechanoreceptors called P cells, each with a receptive field confined to a single quadrant 
of the body wall (Fig. lb). Output to the muscles is provided by eight types of 
longitudinal muscle motor neurons, one to four excitatory and inhibitory motor neurons 
for each body wall quadrant (Stuart, 1970; Ort et al., 1974). Motor neurons are connected 
by chemical and electrical synapses that introduce the possibility of feedback among the 
motor neurons. 
Dorsal, ventral, and lateral stimuli each produce a pattern of P cell activation that results 
in a unique pattern of activation and inhibition of the motor neurons (Lockery and 
Kristan, 1990a). Connections between sensory and motor neurons are mediated by a layer 
of interneurons (Kristan, 1982). Nine types of local bending interneurons have been 
identified (Lockery and Kristan, 1990b). These comprise the subset of the local bending 
interneurons which contribute to dorsal local bending because they are excited by the 
dorsal P cell and in turn excite the dorsal excitatory motor neuron. There appear to be no 
functional connections between interneurons. Other intemeurons remain to be identified, 
such as those which inhibit the dorsal excitatory motor neurons. 
Interneuron input connections were determined by recording the amplitude of the 
postsynapfic potential in an interneuron while each of the P cells was stimulated with a 
standard train of impulses (Lockery and Kristan, 1990b). Output connections were 
determined by recording the amplitude of the postsynaptic potential in each motor neuron 
when an interneuron was stimulated with a standard current pulse. Interneuron input and 
output connections are shown in Figure 2, where white squares are excitatory 
connections, black squares are inhibitory connections, and the size of each square indicates 
connection strength. Most interneurons received substantial input from three or four P 
cells, indicating that the local bending network forms a distributed representation of 
sensory input.

interneurons. Within each gray box, the upper panel shows input connections from 
sensory neurons, the middle panel shows output connections to inhibitory motor 
neurons, and the lower panel shows output connections to excitatory motor neurons. 
Side-length of each box is proportional to the amplitude of the connection determined 
from intracellular recordings of interneurons or motor neurons. White boxes indicate 
excitatory connections and black boxes indicated inhibitory connections. Blank spaces 
denote conections whose strength has not been determined for technical reasons.

Because sensory input is represented in a distributed fashion, most interneurons are active 
in all forms of local bending. Thus, in addition to contributing to dorsal local bending, 
most interneurons are also active during ventral and lateral bending when some or all of 
their output effects are inappropriate to the observed behavioral response. This suggests 
that the inappropriate effects of the dorsal bending intemeurons must be offset by other as 
yet unidentified interneurons and raises the possibility that local bending is the result of 
simultaneous activation of a population of interneurons with multiple sensory inputs and 
both appropriate and inappropriate effects on many motor neurons. It was not obvious, 
however, that such a population was sufficient, given the well-known nonlinearities of 
neural elements and constraints imposed by the input-output function and connections 
known to exist in the network. The possibility remained that interneurons specific for 
each form of the behavior were required to produce each output pattern. To address this 
issue, we used recurrent back-propagation (Pearlmutter, 1989) to train a dynamical 
network of model neurons (Fig 3a).

Figure 3: a. The local bending network model. Four sensory neurons were connected to 
eight motor neurons via a layer of 10 interneurons. Neurons were represented as single 
electrical compartments whose voltage varied as a function of time (see tex0. Known 
electrical and chemical connections among motor neurons were assigned fixed connection 
strengths (g's and w's) determined from intracellular recordings. Interneuron input and 
output connections were adjusted by recurrent back-propagation. Chemical synaptic 
delays were implemented by inserting s-units between chemically connected pairs of 
neurons. S-units with different time constants were inserted between sensory and 
interneurons to account for fast and slow components of synaptic potentials recorded in 
interneurons. b. Output of the model network in response to simultaneous activation of
