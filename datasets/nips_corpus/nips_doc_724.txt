Abstract 
Based on precise anatomical data of the bee's olfactory system, we 
propose an investigation of the possible mechanisms of modulation and 
control between the two levels of olfactory information processing: the 
antennal lobe glomeruli and the mushroom bodies. We use simplified 
neurons, but realistic architecture. As a first conclusion, we postulate 
that the feature extraction performed by the antennal lobe (glomeruli and 
interneurons) necessitates central input from the mushroom bodies for 
fine tuning. The central input thus facilitates the evolution from fuzzy 
olfactory images in the glomerular layer towards more focussed images 
upon odor presentation. 
1. Introduction 
Honeybee foraging behavior is based on discrimination among complex odors which is the 
result of a memory process involving extraction and recall of key-features representative 
of the plant aroma (for a review see Masson et al. 1993). The study of the neural correlates 
of such mechanisms requires a determination of how the olfactory system successively 
analyses odors at each stage (namely: receptor cells, antennal lobe interneurons and 
glomeruli, mushroom bodies). Thus far, all experimental studies suggest the implication 
of both antennal lobe and mushroom bodies in these processes. The signal transmitted by 
the receptor cells is essentially unstable and fluctuating. The antennal lobe appears as the 
location of noise reduction and feature extraction. The specific associative components 
operating on the olfactory memory trace would be essentially located in the mushroom 
bodies. The results of neuroethological experiments indicate furthermore that both the

feed-forward connections from the antennal lobe projection neurons to the mushroom 
bodies and the feedback connections from the mushroom bodies to the antennal lobe 
neurons are crucial for the storage and the recall of odor signals (Masson 1977; Erber et al. 
1980; Erber 1981). 
Interestingly, the antennal lobe compares to the mammalian olfactory bulb. Computational 
models of the insect antennal lobe (Kerszberg and Masson 1993; Linster et al. 1993) and 
the mammalian olfactory bulb (Anton et al. 1991; Li and Hopfield 1989; Schild 1988) 
have demonstrated that feature extraction can be performed in the glomerular layer, but the 
possible role of central input to the glomerular layer has not been investigated (although it 
has been included, as a uniform signal, in the Li and Hopfield model). On the other hand, 
several models of the mammalian olfactory cortex (Hasselmo 1993; Wilson and Bower 
1989; Liljenstr6m 1991) have investigated its associative memory function, but have 
ignored the nature of the input from the olfactory bulb to this system. 
Based on anatomical and electrophysiological data obtained for the bee's olfactory system 
(Fonta et al. 1993; Sun et al. 1993), we propose in this paper to investigate of the 
possible mechanisms of modulation and control between the two levels of olfactory 
information processing in a formal neural model. In the model, the presentation of an 
odor (a mixture of several molecules) differentially activates several populations of 
glomeruli. Due to coupling by local interneurons, competition is triggered between the 
activated glomeruli, in agreement with a recent proposal (Kerszberg and Masson 1993). We 
investigate the role of the different types of neurons implicated in the circuitry, and study 
the modulation of the glomerular states by reentrant input from the upper centers in the 
brain (i.e. mushroom bodies). 
2. Olfactory circuitry in the bee's antennal lobe and mushroom 
bodies 
95% of sensory cells located on the bee's antenna are olfactory (Esslen and Kaissling 
1976), and convey signals to the antennal lobes. In the honeybee, due to some overlap of 
receptor cell responses, the peripheral representation of an odor stimulus is represented in 
an across fiber code (Fonta et al. 1993). Sensory axons project on two categories of 
antennal lobe neurons, namely local interneurons (LIN) and output neurons (ON). The 
synaptic contacts between sensory neurons and antennal lobe neurons, as well as the 
synaptic contacts between antennal lobe neurons are localized in areas of high synaptic 
density, the antennal lobe glomeruli; each glomerulus represents an identifiable 
morphological neuropilar sub-unit (of which there are 165 for the worker honeybee) 
(Arnold et al. 1985). 
Local interneurons constitute the majority of antennal lobe neurons, and there is evidence 
that a majority of the LINs are inhibitory. As receptor cells are supposed to synapse 
mainly with LINs, the high level of excitation observed in the responses of ONs suggests 
that local excitation also exists (Malun 1991), in the form of spiking or non-spiking LINs, 
or as a modulation of local excitatbility. 
All LINs are pluriglomerular, but the majority of them, heterogeneous local intemeurons 
(or HeteroLINs), have a high density of dendfite branches in one particular glomerulus, and 
sparser branches distributed across other glomemli. A second category, homogeneous local 
interneurons (or Homo LINs), distribute their branches more homogeneously over the 
whole antennal lobe. Similarly, some of the ONs have dendrites invading only one 
glomerulus (Uniglomerular, or Uni ON), whereas the others (Pluri ON) are 
pluriglomerular. The axons of both types of ON project to different areas of the 
protocerebmm, including the mushroom bodies (Fonta et al. 1993).

3. Olfactory processing in the bee's antennal lobe glomeruli 
Responses of antennal lobe neurons to various odor stimuli are characterized by complex 
temporal patterns of activation and inactivation (Sun et al. 1993). Intracellularly recorded 
responses to odor mixtures are in general very complex and difficult to interpret from the 
responses to single odor components. A tendency to select particular odor related 
information is expressed by the category of localized antennal lobe neurons, both Hetero 
LINs and Uni ONs. In contrast, global neurons, both Homo LINs and Pluri ONs are 
often more responsive to mixtures than to single components. This might indicate that the 
related localized glomeruli represent functional sub units which are particularly involved in 
the discrimination of some key features. 
An adaptation of the 2DG method to the honeybee antennal lobe has permitted to study the 
spatial distribution of odor related activity in the antennal lobe glomeruli (Nicolas et al. 
1993; Masson et al. 1993). Results obtained with several individuals indicate that a 
correspondence can be established between two different odors and the activity maps they 
induce. This suggests that in the antennal lobe, different odor qualities with different 
biological meaning might be decoded according to separate spatial maps sharing a number 
of common processing areas. 
4. Model of olfactory circuitry 
In the model, we introduce the different categories of neurons described above (Figure 1). 
Glomeruli are grouped into several regions and each receptor cell projects onto all local 
interneurons with arborizations in one region. Interneurons corresponding to heterogeneous 
LINs can be (i) excitatory, these have a dendritic arborization (input and output synapses) 
restricted to one glomerulus; they provide local excitation, or, (ii) inhibitory, these have 
a dense arborization (mainly input synapses) in one glomerulus and sparse arborizations 
(mainly output synapses) in all others; they provide local inhibition and lateral 
inhibition between glomeruli. Interneurons corresponding to homogeneous LINs are 
inhibitory and have sparse arborizations (input and output synapses) in all glomeruli; they 
provide uniform inhibition over the glomerular layer. 
Output neurons are postsynaptic only to interneurons, they do not receive direct input from 
receptor cells. Each output neuron collects information from all interneurons in one 
glomerulus: thus modeling uniglomerular ONs. 
Implementation: The different neuron populations associated with one glomerulus are 
represented in the program as one unit (each unit is governed by one differential equation); 
the output of one unit represents the average firing probability of all neurons in this 
population (assuming that on the average, all neurons in one population receive the same 
input and have the same intrinsic properties). All units have membrane constants and a 
non-linear output function. Connection delays and connection strengths between units are 
chosen randomly around an average value: this assures a realistic spatial averaging over 
populations. The differential equations associated with the units are translated into 
difference equations and simulated by synchronous updating (sampling step 5ms).
