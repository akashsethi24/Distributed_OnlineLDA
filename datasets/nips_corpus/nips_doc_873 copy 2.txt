Abstract 
Current understanding of the effects of damage on neural networks 
is rudimentary, even though such understanding could lead to im- 
portant insights concerning neurological and psychiatric disorders. 
Motivated by this consideration, we present a simple analytical 
framework for estimating the functional damage resulting from fo- 
cal structural lesions to a neural network. The effects of focal le- 
sions of varying area, shape and number on the retrieval capacities 
of a spatially-organized associative memory. Although our analyti- 
cal results are based on some approximations, they correspond well 
with simulation results. This study sheds light on some important 
features characterizing the clinical manifestations of multi-infarct 
dementia, including the strong association between the number of 
infarcts and the prevalence of dementia after stroke, and the 'mul- 
tiplicative' interaction that has been postulated to occur between 
Alzheimer's disease and multi-infarct dementia.

1 Introduction 
Understanding the response of neural nets to structural/functional damage is im- 
portant for a variety of reasons, e.g., in assessing the performance of neural network 
hardware, and in gaining understanding of the mechanisms underlying neurologi- 
cal and psychiatric disorders. Recently, there has been a growing interest in con- 
structing neural models to study how specific pathological neuroanatomical and 
neurophysiological changes can result in various clinical manifestations, and to in- 
vestigate the functional organization of the symptoms that result from specific brain 
pathologies (reviewed in [1, 2]). In the area of associative memory models specifi- 
cally, early studies found an increase in memory impairment with increasing lesion 
severity (in accordance with Lashley's classical 'mass action' principle), and showed 
that slowly developing lesions have less pronounced effects than equivalent acute 
lesions [3]. Recently, it was shown that the gradual pattern of clinical deterioration 
manifested in the majority of Alzheimer's patients can be accounted for, and that 
different synaptic compensation rates can account for the observed variation in the 
severity and progression rate of this disease [4]. However, this past work is limited 
in that model elements have no spatial relationships to one another (all elements 
are conceptually equidistant). Thus, as there is no way to represent focal (localized) 
damage in such networks, it has not been possible to study the functional effect of 
focal lesions and to compare them with that caused by diffuse lesions. 
The limitations of past work led us to use spattally-organized neural network for 
studying the effects of different types of lesions (we use the term lesion to mean 
any type of structural and functional damage inflicted on an initially intact neural 
network). The elements in our model, which can be thought of as representing 
neurons, or micro-columnar units, form a 2-dimensional array (whose edges are 
connected, forming a torus to eliminate edge effects), and each unit is connected 
primarily to its nearby neighbors, as is the case in the cortex [5]. It has recently been 
shown that such spattally-organized attractor networks can function reasonably well 
as associative memory devices [6]. This paper presents the first detailed analysis of 
the effects of lesions of various size, form and number on the memory performance 
of spattally-organized attractor neural networks. Assuming that these networks are 
a plausible model of some frontal and associative cortical areas (see, e.g., [7]), our 
results shed light on the clinical progress of disorders such as stroke and dementia. 
In the next section, we derive a theoretical framework that characterizes the effects 
of focal lesions on an associative network's performance. This framework, which 
is formulated in very general terms, is then examined via simulations in Section 3, 
which show a remarkable quantitative fit with the theoretical predictions, and are 
compared with simulations examining performance with diffuse damage. Finally, 
the clinical significance of our results is discussed in Section 4. 
2 Analyzing the effects of focal lesions 
Our analysis pertains to the case where in the pre-damaged network, all units 
have an approximately similar average level of activity  A focal structural lesion

is averaged over a sufficiently long time span.

(anatomical lesion), denoting the area of damage and neuronal death, is modeled 
by clamping the activity of the lesioned units to zero. As a result of this primary 
lesion, the activity of surrounding units may be decreased, resulting in a secondary 
area of functional lesion, as illustrated in Figure 1. We are primarily interested in 
large focal lesions, where the area s of the lesion is significantly greater than the 
local neighborhood region from which each unit receives its inputs. Throughout our 
analysis we shall hold the working assumption that, traversing from the border of 
the lesion outwards, the activity of units gradually rises from zero until it reaches 
its normal, predamaged levels, at some distance d from the lesion's border (see 
Figure 1). As s is large and d is determined by local interactions on the borders of 
the structural lesion, we may reasonably assume that the value of d is independent 
of the lesion size, and depends primarily on the specific network characteristics, 
such as it architecture, dynamics, and memory load.

shading) rectangular lesion. 
Let the intact baseline performance level of the network be denoted as P(0), and 
let the network size be A. The network's performance denotes how accurately it 
retrieves the correct memorized patterns given a set of input cues, and is defined 
formally below. A structural lesion of area s (dark shading in Figure 1), causing 
a functional lesion of area As (light shading in Figure 1), will then result in a 
performance level of approximately 
P(s) : P(O) [A - (s + As)] + PaAs = P(0) - (APAs)/(A - s) (1) 
.g- $ ' 
where Pa denotes the average level of performance over As and AP = P(0) - PA. 
P(s) hence reflects the performance level over the remaining viable parts of the 
network, discarding the structurally damaged region. Bearing these definitions in 
mind, a simple analysis shows that the effect of focal lesions is governed by the 
following rules. 
Consider a symmetric, circular structural lesion of size s = 7rr 2. As, the area of 
functional damage following such a lesion is then (assuming large lesions and hence

for some constant k = v/dAP. Thus, the area of functional damage surrounding 
a single focal structural lesion is proportional to the square root of the structural 
lesion's area. Some analytic performance/lesioning curves (for various k values) are 
illustrated in Figure 2. Note the different qualitative shape of these curves as a 
function of k. Letting x = s/A be the fraction of structural damage, we have

that is, the same fraction x of damage results in less performance decrease in larger 
networks. This surprising result testifies to the possible protective value of having 
functional 'modular' cortical networks of large size. 
Expressions 3 and 4 are valid also when the structural lesion has a square shape. 
To study the effect of the structural lesion's shape, we consider the area As[hi of 
a functional lesion resulting from a rectangular focal lesion of size s = a ï¿½ b (see 
Figure 1), where, without loss of generality, n = a/b _ 1. Then, for large n, we find 
that the functional damage of a rectangular structural lesion of fixed size increases 
as its shape is more elongated, following

To study the effect of the number of lesions, consider the area A,  of a functional 
lesion composed of m focal rectangular structural lesions (with sides a = n. b), each 
of area s/to. We find that the functional damage increases with the number of focal 
sub-lesions (while total structural lesion area is held constant), according to

While Rule 3 presents a lower bound on the functional damage which may actually 
be significantly larger and involves no approximations, Rule 2 presents an upper 
bound on the actual functional damage. As we shall show in the next section, the 
number of lesions actually affects the network performance significantly more than 
its precise shape. 
3 Numerical Simulation Results 
We now turn to examine the effect of lesions on the performance of an associa- 
tive memory network via simulations. The goal of these simulations is twofold. 
First, to examine how accurately the general but approximate theoretical results 
presented above describe the actual performance degradation in a specific associa- 
tive network. Second, to compare the effects
