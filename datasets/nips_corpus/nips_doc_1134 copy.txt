Abstract 
Analog electronic cochlear models need exponentially scaled filters. 
CMOS Compatible Lateral Bipolar Transistors (CLBTs) can create 
exponentially scaled currents when biased using a resistive line with a 
voltage difference between both ends of the line. Since these CLBTs 
are independent of the CMOS threshold voltage, current sources 
implemented with CLBTs are much better matched than current 
sources created with MOS transistors operated in weak inversion. 
Measurements from integrated test chips are shown to verify the 
improved matching. 
1. INTRODUCTION 
Since the original publication of the analog electronic cochlea by Lyon and Mead in 
1988 [1], several other analog VLSI models have been proposed which try to capture 
more of the details of the biological cochlear function [2],[3],[4]. In spite of the 
differences in their design, all these models use filters with exponentially decreasing cut- 
off frequencies. This exponential dependency is generally obtained using a linear 
decreasing voltage on the gates of MOS transistors operating in weak-inversion. In 
weak-inversion, the drain current of a saturated MOS transistor depends exponentially 
on its gate voltage. The linear decreasing voltage is easily created using a resistive 
polysilicon line; if there is a voltage difference between the two ends of the line, the 
voltage on the line will decrease linearly all along its length.

The problem of using MOS transistors in weak-inversion as current sources is that their 
drain currents are badly matched. An RMS mismatch of 12% in the drain current of two 
identical transistors with equal gate and source voltages is not exceptional [5], even 
when sufficient precautions, such as a good layout, are taken. The main cause of this 
mismatch is a variation of the threshold voltage between the two transistors. Since the 
threshold voltage and its variance are technology parameters, there is no good way to 
reduce the mismatch once the chip has been fabricated. 
One can avoid this problem using Compatible Lateral Bipolar Transistors (CLBTs) [6] 
for the current sources. They can be readily made in a CMOS substrate, and their 
collector current also depends exponentially on their base voltage, while this current is 
completely independent of the CMOS technology's threshold voltage. The remaining 
mismatch is due to geometry mismatch of the devices, a parameter which is much better 
controlled than the variance of the threshold voltage. Therefore, the use of CLBTs can 
yield a large improvement in the regularity of the spacing of the cochlear filters. This 
regularity is especially important in a cascade of filters like the cochlea, since one filter 
can distort the input signal of all the following filters. 
We have integrated an analog electronic cochlea as a cascade of second-order low-pass 
filters, using CLBTs as exponentially scaled current sources. The design of this cochlea 
is based on the silicon cochlea described in [7], since a number of important design 
issues, such as stability, dynamic range, device mismatch and compactness, have already 
been addressed in this design. In this paper, the design of [7] is briefly presented and 
some remaining possible improvements are identified. These improvements, notably the 
use of Compatible Lateral Bipolar Transistors as current sources, a differentiation that 
does not need gain correction and temperature independent biasing of the cut-off 
frequency, are then discussed in more detail. Finally, measurement results of a test chip 
will be presented and compared to the design without CLBTs. 
2. THE ANALOG ELECTRONIC COCHLEA 
The basic building block for the filters in all analog electronic cochlear models is the 
transconductance amplifier, operated in weak inversion. For input voltages smaller than 
about 60 mVpp, the amplifier can be approximated as a linear transconductance: 
Iot = gm(Vra+ - Via.) 
(1) 
with transconductance gm given by: 
Io 
gm= 2nUT (2) 
where Io is the bias current, n is the slope factor, and the thermal voltage UT = kT/q = 
25.6 mV at room temperature. 
This linear range is usually the input range used in the cochlear filters, yielding linear 
filters. In [7], a transconductance amplifier having a wider linear input range is 
proposed. This allows larger input signals to be used, up to about 140mVpp. 
Furthermore, the wide range transconductance amplifier can be used to eliminate the 
large-signal instability shown to be present in the original second-order section [7]. This 
second-order section will be discussed in more detail in section 3.2.

The traditional techniques to improve matching [5], as for instance larger device sizes 
for critical devices and placing identical devices close together with identical 
orientation, are also discussed in [7] with respect to the implementation of the cochlear 
filter cascade. The transistors generating the bias current Io of the transconductance 
amplifiers in the second-order sections were identified as the most critical devices, since 
they have the largest effect on the cut-off frequency and the quality factor of each 
section. Therefore, extra area had to be devoted to these bias transistors. A further 
improvement is obtained in [7] by using a single resistive line to bias both the 
transconductance amplifiers controlling the cut-off frequency and the transconductance 
amplifier controlling the quality factor. The quality factor Q is then changed by varying 
the source of the transistor which biases the Q control amplifier. Instead of using two 
tilted resistive lines, this scheme uses only one tilted resistive line and a non-tilted Q 
control line, and therefore doesn't need to rely on an identical tilt on both resistive lines. 
3. IMPROVED ANALOG ELECTRONIC COCHLEA 
The design discussed in the previous section already showed a substantial improvement 
over the fu'st analog electronic cochlea by Lyon and Mead. However, several 
improvements remain possible. 
3.1 VT VARIATION 
The bias transistors have been identified as the major source of mismatch of the 
cochlea's parameters. This mismatch is mainly due to variation of the threshold voltage 
V-r of the MOS transistors. Since the drain current of a saturated MOS transistor in 
weak-inversion depends exponentially on the difference between its gate-source voltage 
and its threshold voltage, small variations in V-r introduce large variations in the drain 
current of these transistors, and since both the cut-off frequency and the quality factor of 
the filters are proportional to these drain currents, large parameter variations are 
generated by small VT variations. This problem can be circumvented by the use of 
CMOS Compatible Lateral Bipolar transistors as bias transistors. 
A CMOS Compatible Lateral Bipolar Transistor is obtained if the drain or source 
junction of a MOS transistor is forward-biased in order to inject minority carriers into 
the local substrate. If the gate voltage is negative enough (for an n-channel device), then 
no current can flow at the surface and the operation is purely bipolar [6]. Fig. 1 shows 
the major flows of current carriers in this mode of operation, with the source, drain and 
well terminals renamed emitter E, collector C and base B.

Since there is no p+ buried layer to prevent injection to the substrate, this lateral npn 
bipolar transistor is combined with a vertical npn. The emitter current I. is thus split 
into a base current IB, a lateral collector current Ic and a substrate collector current Isub. 
Therefore, the common-base current gain ct = -Ic/I. cannot be close to 1. However, due 
to the very small rate of recombination inside the well and to the high emitter efficiency, 
the common-emitter current gain [5 = Ic/IB can be large. Maximum values of ct and [5 are 
obtained in concentric structures using a minimum size emitter surrounded by the 
collector and a minimum lateral base width. 
For Vc. = VBE'VBc larger than a few hundred millivolts, this transistor is in active mode 
and the collector current is given, as for a normal bipolar transistor, by 
Ic = Isb e Ur (4) 
where Isb is the specific current in bipolar mode, proportional to the cross-section of the 
emitter to collector flow of carriers. Since Ic is independent of the MOS transistor 
threshold voltage VT, the main source of mismatch of distributed MOS current sources is 
suppressed, when CLBTs are used to create the current sources.

A disadvantage of the CLBT is its low Early voltage, i.e., the device has a low output 
resistance. Therefore, it is preferable to use a cascode circuit as shown in fig. 2. This 
yields an output resistance several hundred times larger than that of the single CLBT, 
whereas the area penalty, in a layout as shown in fig 2b, is acceptable. 
Another disadvantage of the CLBTs, when biased using a resistive line, is their base 
current, which introduces an additional voltage drop on the resistive line. However, 
since the cut-off frequencies in the cochlea are controlled by the output current of the 
CLBTs and since these cut-off frequencies are relatively small, typically 20 kHz, the 
output current of the CLBTs will be small. If the common-emitter current gain [5 is 
much larger than 1, the base current of these CLBTs will be very small, and the voltage
