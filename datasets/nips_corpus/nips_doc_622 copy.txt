Abstract 
A model of the hippocampus as a central element in rat naviga- 
tion is presented. Simulations show both the behaviour of single 
cells and the resultant navigation of the rat. These are compared 
with single unit recordings and behavioural data. The firing of 
CA1 place cells is simulated as the (artificial) rat moves in an en- 
vironment. This is the input for a neuronal network whose output, 
at each theta (0) cycle, is the next direction of travel for the rat. 
Cells are characterised by the number of spikes fired and the time 
of firing with respect to hippocampal 0 rhythm. 'Learning' occurs 
in 'on-off' synapses that are switched on by simultaneous pre- and 
post-synaptic activity. The simulated rat navigates successfully to 
goals encountered one or more times during exploration in open 
fields. One minute of random exploration of a lrn 2 environment 
allows navigation to a newly-presented goal from novel starting po- 
sitions. A limited number of obstacles can be successfully avoided. 
1 Background 
Experiments have shown the hippocampus to be crucial to the spatial memory and 
navigational ability of the rat (O'Keefe & Nadel, 1978). Single unit recordings in 
freely moving rats have revealed 'place cells' in fields CA3 and CA1 of the hip- 
pocampus whose firing is restricted to small portions of the rat's environment (the 
corresponding 'place fields') (O'Keefe & Dostrovsky, 1971), see Fig. la. In addi- 
tion cells have been found in the dorsal pre-subiculum whose primary behavioural

correlate is 'head-direction' (Taube et al., 1990). Both are suggestive of navigation. 
Temporal as well as spatial aspects of the electrophysiology of the hippocampal 
region are significant for a model. The hippocampal EEG '0 rhythm' is best char- 
acterised as a sinusoid of frequency 7- 12Hz and occurs whenever the rat is making 
displacement movements. Recently place cell firing has been found to have a sys- 
tematic phase relationship to the local EEG (O'Keefe & Recce, 1992), see �3.1 and 
Fig. lb. Finally, the 0 rhythm has been found to modulate long-term potentiation 
of synapses in the hippocampus (Pavlides et al., 1988). 
2 Introduction 
We are designing a model that is consistent with both the data from single unit 
recording and the behavioural data that are relevant to spatial memory and navi- 
gation in the rat. As a first step this paper examines a simple navigational strategy 
that could be implemented in a physiologically plausible way to enable navigation 
to previously encountered reward sites from novel starting positions. We assume 
the firing properties of CA1 place cells, which form the input for our system. 
The simplest map-based strategies (as opposed to route-following ones) are based 
on defining a surface over the whole environment, on which gradient ascent leads to 
the goal (e.g. delayed reinforcement or temporal difference learning). These tend 
to have the problem that, to build up this surface, the goal must be reached many 
times, from different points in the environment (by which time the rat has died of 
old age). Further, a new surface must be computed if the goal is moved. Specific 
problems are raised by the properties of rats' navigation: (i) the position of CA1 
place fields is independent of goal position (Speakman & O'Keefe, 1990); (ii) high 
firing rates in place cells are restricted to limited portions of the environment; (iii) 
rats are able to navigate after a brief exploration of the environment, and (iv) can 
take novel short-cuts or detours (Tolman, 1948). 
Using hippocampal 'place cells' for navigation, exploiting phase coding 931 
To overcome these problems we propose that a more diffuse representation of posi- 
tion is rapidly built up downstream of CA1, by cells with larger firing fields than in 
CA1. The patterns of activation of this group of cells, at two different locations in 
the environment, have a correlation that decreases with the separation of the two 
locations (but never reaches zero, as is the case with small place fields). Thus the 
overlap between t. hc pattern of activity at any moment and the pattern of activity 
at the goal location would bca measure of nearness to the goal. Wc refer to these 
cells as 'subicular' cells because the subiculum seems a likely site for them, given 
single unit recordings (Barnes ctal., 1990) showing spatially consistent firing over 
large parts of the environment. 
We show that the output of these subicular cells is sufficient to enable navigation 
in our model. In addition the model requires: (i) 'goal' cells (see Fig. 4a) that 
fire when a goal is encountered, allowing synaptic connections from subicular cells 
to be switched on, (ii) phase-coded place cell firing, (iii)'head-direction' cells, and 
(iv) synaptic change that is modulated by the phase of the EEG. The relative 
firing rates of groups of goal cells code for the direction of objects encountered 
during exploration, in the same way that ccl. ls in primate motor cortex code for the 
direction of arm movements (Gcorgopoulos ct al., 1988). 
3 The model 
In our simulation a rat is in constant motion (speed 30cm/s) in a square environment 
of size L x L (L _ 150cm). Food or obstacles can be placed in the environment 
at any time. The rat is aware of any objects within 6cm (whisker length) of its 
position. It bounces off any obstacles (or the edge of the environment) with which 
it collides. The 0 frequency is taken to be 10Hz (period 0.1s) and we model each 
0 cycle as having 5 different phases. Thus the smallest timestep (at which synaptic 
connections and cell firing rates are updated) is 0.02s. The rat is either 'exploring' 
(its current direction is a random variable within 300 of its previous direction), or 
'searching' (its current direction is determined by the goal cells, see below). Synaptic 
and cell update rules are the same during searching or exploring. 
3.1 The phase of CA1 place cell firing 
When a rat on a linear track runs through a place field, the place cell fires at 
successively earlier phases of the EEG 0 rhythm. A cell that fires at phase 3600 
when the rat enters the place field may fire as much as 3550 earlier in the 0 cycle 
when exiting the field (O'Keefe & Recce, 1992), see Fig. lb. 
Simulations below involve 484 CA1 place cells with place field centres spread evenly 
on a grid over the whole environment. The place fields are circular, with diameters 
0.25L, 0.35L or 0.4L (as place fields appear to scale with the size of an environment; 
Muller & Kubie, 1987). The fraction of cells active during any 0.1s interval is thus 
vr(0.1252 q- 0.1752 q- 0.22)/3 ----- 9%. When the rat is in a cell's place field it fires 1 to 
3 spikes depending on its distance from the field centre, see Fig. 2b. 
When the (simulated) rat first enters a place field the cell fires 1 spike at phase 
3600 of the 0 rhythm; as the rat moves through the place field, its phase of firing 
shifts backwards by 720 every time the number of spikes fired by the cell changes

(i.e. each time it crosses a line in Fig. 2b). Thus each theta cycle is divided into 
5 timesteps. No shift results from passing through the edge of the field, whereas a 
shift of 2880 (0.08s) results from passing through the middle of the field, see Fig. 
2c. The consequences for the model in terms of which place cells fire at different 
phases within one 0 cycle are shown in Fig. 3. The cells that are active at phase 
3600 have place fields centred ahead of the position of the rat (i.e. place fields that 
the rat is entering), those active at phase 0 � have place fields centred behind the 
rat. If the rat is simultaneously leaving field A and entering field B then cell A fires 
before cell B, having shifted backwards by up to 0.08s. The total number of spikes 
fired at each phase as the rat moves about implies that the envelope of all the spikes 
fired in CA1 oscillates with the 0 frequency. Fig. 2d shows the shift in the firing of 
one cell compared to the envelope (cf. Fig. lb). 
3.2 Subicular cells 
We simulate 6 groups of 80 cells (480 in total); each subicular cell receives one 
synaptic connection from a random 5% of the CA1 cells. These connections are 
either on or off (1 or 0). At each timestep (0.02s) the 10 cells in each group with 
the greatest excitatory input from CA1 fire between i and 5 spikes (depending on 
their relative excitation). Fig. 3c shows a typical subicular firing rate map. The 
consequences of phase coding in CA1 (Figs. 3a and b) remain in these subicular
