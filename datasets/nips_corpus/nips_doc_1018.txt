Abstract 
In this paper we examine the practical use of hardware neural 
networks in an autonomous mobile robot. We have developed a 
hardware neural system based around a custom VLSI chip, EP- 
SILON II , designed specifically for embedded hardware neural 
applications. We present here a demonstration application of an 
autonomous mobile robot that highlights the flexibility of this sys- 
tem. This robot gains basic mobility competence in very few train- 
ing epochs using an instinct-rule training methodology. 
I INTRODUCTION 
Though neural networks have been shown as an effective solution for a diverse range 
of real-world problems, applications and especially hardware implementations have 
been few and slow to emerge. For example in the DARPA neural networks study 
of 1988; of the 77 neural network applications investigated only 4 had resulted in 
field tested systems [Widrow, 1988]. Furthermore, none of these used dedicated 
neural network hardware. It is our view that this lack of tangible successes can be 
summarised by the following points: 
Most neural applications will be served optimally by fast, generic digital 
computers. 
Dedicated digital neural accelerators have a limited lifetime as the fastest, 
as standard computers develop so rapidly.

Analog neural VLSI is a niche technology, optimally applied at the interface 
between the real world and higher-level digital processing. 
This attitude has some profound implications with respect to the size, nature and 
constraints we place on new hardware neural designs. After several years of research 
into hardware neural network implementation, we have now concentrated on the 
areas in which analog neural network technology has an edge over well established 
digital technology. 
Within the pulse stream neural network research at the University of Edinburgh, 
the EPSILON chip's areas of strength can be summarised as: 
Analog or digital inputs, digital outputs. 
Scaleable and cascadeable design. 
Modest size. 
Compact, low power. 
This list points naturally and strongly to problems on the boundary of the real, 
analog world and digital processing, such as pre-processing/interpretation of analog 
sensor data. Here a modest neural network can act as an intelligent analog-to-digital 
converter presenting preprocessed information to its host. We are now engaged 
in a two pronged approach, whereby development of technology to improve the 
performance of pulse stream neural network chips is occurring concurrently with 
a search and development of applications to which this technology can be applied. 
The key requirements of this technological development are that devices must: 
Work directly with analog signals. 
Provide a moderate size network. 
Have the potential for a fully integrated solution. 
In working with the above constraints and goals we have developed a new chip, 
EPSILON II, and a bus based processor card incorporating it. It is our aim to 
use this system to develop applications. As our first demonstration the EPSILON 
processor card has been mounted on an autonomous mobile robot. In this case the 
network utilises a mixture of analog and digital sensor information and performs a 
mapping between input/sensor space, a mixture of analog and digital signals, and 
output motor control. 
2 THE EPSILON II CHIP 
The EPSILON II chip has been designed around the requirements of an application 
based system. It follows on from an earlier generation of pulse stream neural network 
chip, the EPSILON chip [Murray, 1992]. 
The EPSILON II chip represents neural states as a pulse encoded signal. These pulse 
encoded signals have digital signal levels which make them highly immune to noise 
and ideal for inter and intra-chip communication, facilitating efficient cascading of 
chips to form larger systems. The EPSILON II chip can take as inputs either pulse 
encoded signals or analog voltage levels, thus facilitating the fusing of analog and 
digital data in one system. Internally the chip is analog in nature allowing the 
synaptic multiplication function to be carried out in compact and efficient analog 
cells [Jackson, 1994]. 
Table i shows the principal specifications of the EPSILON II chip. The EPSI- 
LON II chip is based around a 32x32 synaptic matrix allowing efficient interfacing 
to digital systems. Several features of the device have been developed specifically 
for applications based usage. The first of these is a programmable input mode. This

allows each of the network inputs to be programmed as either a direct analog input 
or a digital pulse encoded input. We believe that this is vital for application based 
usage where it is often necessary to fuse real-world analog data with historical or 
control data generated digitally. The second major feature is a pulse recovery mode. 
This allows conversion of any analog input into a digital value for direct use by the 
host system. Both these features are utilised in the robotics application described 
in section 4 of this paper. 
3 EPSILON PROCESSOR CARD 
The need to embed the EPSILON chip in a processor card is driven by several 
considerations. Firstly, working with pulse encoded signals requires substantial 
processing to interface directly to digital systems. If the neural processor is to 
be transparent to the host system and is not to become a substantial processing 
overhead, then all pulse support operations must be carried out independently of 
the host system. Secondly, to respond to further chip level advances and allow rapid 
prototyping of new applications as they emerge, a certain amount of flexibility is 
needed in the system. It is with these points in mind that the design of the flexible 
EPSILON Processor Card (EPC) was undertaken. 
3.1 DESIGN SPECIFICATION 
The EPC has been designed to meet the following specifications. The card must: 
Operate on a conventional digital bus system. 
Be transparent to the host processor, that is carry out all the necessary 
pulse encoding and decoding. 
Carry out the refresh operations of the dynamic weights stored on the 
EPSILON chip. 
Generate the ramp waveforms necessary for pulse width coding. 
Support the operation of multiple EPC's. 
Allow direct input of analog signals. 
As all data used and generated by the chip is effectively of 8-bit resolution, the STE 
bus, an industry standard 8-bit bus, was chosen for the bus system. This is also cost

effective and allows the use of readily available support cards such as processors, 
DSP cards and analog and digital signal conditioning cards. 
To allow the transparency of operation the card must perform a variety of functions. 
A block diagram indicating these functions is shown in figure 1.

A substantial amount of digital processing is required by the card, especially in the 
pulse conversion circuitry. To conform to the Eurocard standard size of the STE 
specification an FPGA device is used to absorb most of the digital logic. A twin 
mother/daughter board design is also used to isolate sensitive analog circuitry from 
the digital logic. The use of the FPGA makes the card extremely versatile as it 
is now easily reconfigurable to adapt to specialist application. The dotted box of 
figure 1 shows functions implemented by the FPGA device. An on board EPROM 
can hold multiple FPGA configurations such that the board can be reconfigured 
on the fly. All EPSILON support functions, such as ramp generation, weight 
refresh, pulse conversion and interface control are carried out on the card. Also the 
use of the FPGA means that new ideas are easily tested as all digital signal paths 
go via this device. Thus a card of new functionality can be designed without the 
need to design a new PCB. 
3.2 SPECIALIST BUSES 
The digital pulse bus is buffered out under control of the FPGA to the neural bus 
along with two control signals. Handshaking between EPC's is done over these lines 
to allow the transfer of pulse stream data between processors. This implies that 
larger networks can be implemented with little or no increase in computation time 
or overhead. A separate analog bus is included to bring analog inputs directly onto 
the chip. 
4 APPLICATIONS DEVELOPMENT 
The over-riding reason for the development of the EPC is to allow the easy develop- 
ment of hardware neural network applications. We have already indicated that we 
believe that this form of neural technology will find its niche where its advantages 
of direct sensor interface, compactness and cost-effectiieness are of prime import- 
ance. As a good and intrinsically interesting example of this genre of applications, 
we have chosen autonomous mobile robotic control as a first test for EPSILON II. 
The object of this demonstrator is not to advance the state-of-the-art in robotics.
