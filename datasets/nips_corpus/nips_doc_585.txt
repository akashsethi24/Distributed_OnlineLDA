Abstract 
Simplified models of the lateral geniculate nucles (LGN) and stri- 
ate cortex illustrate the possibility that feedback to the LGN may 
be used for robust, low-level pattern analysis. The information 
fed back to the LGN is rebroadcast to cortex using the LGN's full 
fan-out, so the cortexLGNcortex pathway mediates extensive 
cortico-cortical communication while keeping the number of neces- 
sary connections small. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
The lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) in the thalamus is often considered as just a 
relay station on the way from the retina to visual cortex, since receptive field prop- 
erties of neurons in the LGN are very similar to retinal ganglion cell receptive field 
properties. However, there is a massive projection from cortex back to the LGN: 
it is estimated that 3-4 times more synapses in the LGN are due to corticogenicu- 
late connections than those due to retinogeniculate connections [12]. This suggests 
some important processing role for the LGN, but the nature of the computation 
performed has remained far from clear. 
I will first briefly summarize some anatomical facts and physiological results con- 
cerning the corticogeniculate loop, and then present a simplified model in which its 
function is to (usefully) mediate communication between cortical cells.

1.1 SOME ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY 
The LGN contains both principal cells, which project to cortex, and inhibitory 
interneurons. The projection to cortex sends collaterals into a sheet of inhibitory 
cells called the perigeniculate nucleus (PGN). PGN cells, in turn, project back to 
the LGN. The geniculocortical projection then proceeds into cortex, terminating 
principally in layers 4 and 6 in the cat [11, 12]. Areas 17, 18, and to a lesser extent, 
19 are all innervated. Layer 6 cells in area 17 of the cat have particularly long, 
non-end-stopped receptive fields [2]. It is from layer 6 that the corticogeniculate 
projection back originates. 1 It, too, passes through the PGN, sending collaterals 
into it, and then contacts both principal cells and interneurons in the LGN, mostly 
in the more distal parts of their dendrites [10, 13]. Both the forward and the 
backward projection are retinotopically ordered. 
Thus there is the possibility of both excitatory and inhibitory effects in the cortico- 
geniculate projection, which is principally what shall be used in the model. 
The first attempts to study the physiology of the corticogeniculate projection in- 
volved inactivating cortex in some way (often cooling cortex) while observing genic- 
ulate responses to simple visual stimuli. The results were somewhat inconclusive: 
some investigators reported that the projection was excitatory, some that it was in- 
hibitory, and still others that it had no observable effect at all. [1, 5, 9] Later studies 
have emphasized the need for using stimuli which optimally excite the cortical cells 
which project to the LGN; inactivating cortex should then make a significant dif- 
ference in the inputs to geniculate cells. This has helped to reveal some effects: 
for example, LGN cells with corticogeniculate feedback are end-stopped (that is, 
respond much less to long bars than to short bars), while the end-stopping is quite 
clearly reduced when the cortical input is removed [8]. 
One study [13] has used cross-correlation analysis between cortical and geniculate 
cells to suggest that there is spatial structure in the corticogeniculate projection: an 
excitatory corticogeniculate interaction was found if cells had receptive field centers 
that were close to each other, while an inhibitory interaction was found if the centers 
were farther apart. ttowever, the precise spatial structure of the projection remains 
unknown. 
2 A FEEDBACK MODEL 
I will now describe a simplified model of the LGN and the corticogeniculate loop. 
The very simple connection scheme shown in fig 1 originated in a suggestion by 
Christof Koch [3] that the long receptive fields in layer 6 might be used to facilitate 
contour completion at the LGN level. In the model, then, striate cortex simple 
cells feed back positively to the LGN, enhancing the conditions which gave rise 
to their firing. This reinforces, or completes, the oriented bar or edge patterns to 
which they are tuned. Assuming that the visual features of interest are for the most 
part oriented, while much of the noise in images may be isotropic and unoriented, 
enhancing the oriented features improves the signal-to-noise ratio.

Figure 1: Basic model connectivity: A schematic diagram showing the connections 
between different pools of units in the single spatial frequency channel model. LGN cells 
first filter the image linearly through a center-surround filter (72G), the result of which 
is then passed through a sigmoid nonlinearity (tanh). (In the simulations presented here 
G was a Gaussian with standard deviation 1.4 pixels.) V1 cells then provide oriented 
filtering, which is also passed through a nonlinearity (logistic; but see details in text) and 
fed back positively to the LGN to reinforce detected oriented edges. V1 cells excite LGN 
cells which have excitatory connections to them, and inhibit those that have inhibitory 
connections to them. Inhibition is implicitly assumed to be mediated by interneurons. 
(Note that there are no intracortical or intrageniculate connections: communication takes 
place entirely through the feedback loop.) See text for further details. 
For simplicity, only striate cortex simple edge-detecting cells were modeled. Two 
models are presented. In the first one, all cortical cells have the same spatial 
frequency characteristics. In the second one, two channels, a high frequency channel 
and a low frequency channel, interact simultaneously. 
2.1 SINGLE SPATIAL FREQUENCY CHANNEL MODEL 
A schematic diagram of the model is shown in figure 1. The retina is used simply 
as an input layer. To each input position (pixel) in the retina there corresponds 
one LGN unit. Linear weights from the retina to the LGN implement a 7G 
filter, where G(x, y) is a two-dimensional Gaussian. The LGN units then project to 
eight different pools of orientation-tuned cells in V1. Each of these pools has as 
many units as there are pixels in the input retina. The weights in the projection 
forward to V1 represent eight rotations of the template shown in figure 2a, covering 
360 degrees. This simulates basic orientation tuning in V1. Cortical cells then feed 
412 Brody 
back positively to the geniculus, using rotations of the template shown in fig 2(b). 
The precise dynamics of the model are as follows: Ri are real-valued retinal inputs, 
Li are geniculate unit outputs, and V/are cortical cell outputs. Gji represent weights 
from retina  LGN, Fji forward weights from LGN  V1, and Bji backward 
weights from V1  LGN. a,O,7,Tc and T�2 are all constants. For geniculate

LGN to V1. Each circle represents the weight from a cell in the LGN; dark circles represent 
positive weights, light circles negative weights (assumed mediated by interneurons). The 
radius of each circle represents the strength of the corresponding weight. These weights 
create edge-detecting neurons in V1. Figure 2(b): Backwards weights, from V1 back to 
the LGN. Only cells close to the contrast edge receive strong feedback. 
In the scheme described above many cortical cells have overlapping receptive fields, 
both in the forward projection from the geniculus and in the backwards projection 
from cortex. A cell which is reinforcing an edge within its receptive field will also 
partially reinforce the edge for retinotopically nearby cortical cells. For nearby cells 
with similar orientation tuning, the reinforcement will enhance their own firing; 
they will then enhance the firing of other, similar, cells farther along; and so on. 
That is, the overlapping feedback fields allow the edge detection process to follow 
contours (note that the process is tempered at the geniculate level by actual input 
from the retina). This is illustrated in figure 3.

Figure 3: Following contours: This figure shows the effect on the LGN of the feedback 
enhancement. The image on the left is the retinal input: a very weak, noisy horizontal edge. 
The center image is the LGN after two iterations of the simulation. Note that initially 
only certain sectors of the edge are detected (and hence enhanced). The rightmost image 
is the LGN after 8 iterations: the enhanced region has spread to cover the entire edge 
through the effect of horizontally oriented, overlapping receptive fields. This is the final 
stable point of the dynamics. 
2.2 MULTIPLE SPATIAL FREQUENCY CHANNELS MODEL 
In the model described above the LGN is integrating and summarizing the informa- 
tion provided by each of the orientation-tuned pools of cortical cells? It does so in 
a way which would easily extend to cover other types of cortical cells (bar or grat- 
ing detectors, or varying spatial frequency channels). To experiment simply with 
this possibility, an extra set of eight pools of orientation-tuned edge-detecting 
cortical cells was added. The new set's weights were
