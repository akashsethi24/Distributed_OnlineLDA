Abstract 
A neurocomputer was implemented using radial basis functions and a 
combination of analog and digital VLSI cimuits. The hybrid system 
uses custom analog circuits for the input layer and a digital signal 
processiag board for the hidden and output layers. The system combines 
the advantages of both analog and digital cimuits, featuring low power 
consumption while minimizing overall system error. The analog circuits 
have been fabricated and tested, the system has been built, and several 
applications have been executed on the system. One application 
provides significantly better results for a remote sensing problem than 
have been previously obtained using ï¿½onvelltional methods. 
1.0 Introduction 
This paper describes a neurocomputer development system that uses a radial basis 
function as the transfer function of a neuron rather than the traditional sigmoid function. 
This neurocomputer is a hybrid system which has been implemented with a combination 
of analog and digital VLSI technologies. It offers the low-power advantage of analog 
circuits operating in the subthreshold region and the high-precision advantage of digital 
circuits. The system is targeted for applications that require low-power operation and use 
input data in analog form. particularly remote sensing and portable computing 
applications. It has already provided significantly better results for a remote sensing

climate problem than have been previously obts_ined using conventional methods. 
Figure 1 illustrates a radial basis functien (RBF) network. Radial basis functions have 
been used to solve mapping and function estimation problems with positive results 
(Moody and Darken, 1989; Lipproart, 1991). When coupled with a dynamic neuron 
allocation algorithm such as Platt's RANN (Platt, 1991), RBF networks can usually be 
trained much more quickly than a traditional sigmoidal, back-propagation network. 
RBF networks have been implemented with completely-analog (Platt, Anderson and Kirk, 
1993), completely-digital (Watkins, Chau and Tawel, Nov., 1992), and with hybrid analog/ 
digital approaches (Watkins, Chau and Tawel, Oct., 1992). The hybrid approach is optimal 
for applications which require low power consumption and use input data that is naturally 
in the analog domain while also requiring the high precision of the digital domain. 
2.0 System Architecture and Benefits 
Figure 2 shows the mapping of the RBF network to hardware. Figure 3 shows the 
neurocomputex development system. The system consists of a PC controller, a DSP board 
with a Motorola 56000 DSP chip and a board with analog multipliers. The benefits of the 
hybrid approach are lower-cost parallelism than is possible with a completely-digital 
system, and more precise computation than is possible with a completely-analog system. 
The parallelism is available for low cost in terms of area and power, when the inputs are in 
the analog domain. When comparing a single analog multiplier to a 10-bit fixed point 
digital multiplier, the analog cell uses less than one-quarter the area and approximately 
five orders of magnitude less power. When comparing an array of analog multipliers to a 
Motorola 56000 DSP chip, 1000 Gilbert multipliers can fit in an area about haft the size of 
the DSP chip, while consuming .003% of the power. 
The restriction of requiring analog inputs is placed on the system, because if the inputs 
were digital, the high cost of D to A conversion would remove the low cost benefit of the 
system. This restriction causes the neurocomputer to be targeted for applications using 
inputs that are in the analog domain, such as remote sensing applications that use 
microwave or infrared sensors and speech recognition applications that use analog filters. 
The hybrid system reduces the overall system error when compared with a completely- 
analog solution. The digital circuits compute the hidden and output layers with 24 bits of 
precision while analog circuits are limited to about 8 bits of precision. Also the RANN 
algorithm requires a large range of width variation for the Gaussian function and this is 
more easily achieved with digital computation. Completely analog solutions to this 
problem are severely limited by the voltage rails of the chip. 
3.0 Circuits 
Several different analog circuit approaches were explored as possible implementations of 
the network. After the dust settled, we chose to implement only the input layer with analog 
circuits because it offers the greatest oppommity for parallelism, providing parallel 
performance benefits at a low cost in terms of area and power. The input layer requires 
more than O (N 2) computations (where N is the number of neurons), while the hidden and 
output layers require only O(N)computafions (because there is one hidden layer 
computation per neuron and the number of outputs is either one or very small). 
A Hybrid Radial Basis Function Neurocomputer and Its Applications 853 
The analog circuits used in the input layer are Gilbert multipliers (Mead, 1989).'The 
circuits were fabricated with 2.0 micron, double-poly, P-well, CMOS technology. The 
Gilbert cell performs the operation of multiplying two voltage differences: (V1-V2)x(VY 
V4). In this system, V1 =V3 and V2=V4, which causes the circuit to compute the square of 
the difference between a stored weight and the input. The current outputs of the Gilbert 
cells in a row are wired together to sum their currents, giving a sum of squared errors. This 
current is converted to a voltage, fed to an A to D converter and then passed to the DSP 
board where the hidden and output layers are computed. The radial basis function 
(Gaussian) of the hidden layer is computed by using a lookup table. The system uses the 
fast multiply/accumulate operation of the DSP chip to compute the output layer. 
4.0 Applications 
The low-power feature of the hybrid system makes it attractive for applications where 
power consumption is a prime consideration, such as satellite-based applications and 
portable computing (using battery power). The neurocomputer has been applied to three 
problems: a remote sensing climate problem, the Mackey-Glass chaotic time series 
estimation and speech phoneme mco.tmitict. The remote sensing application falls into the 
satellite category. The Mackey-Glass and speech recognition applications are potentially 
portable. Systems for these applications are likely to have inputs in the analog domain 
(eliminating the need for D to A conversion, as already discussed) making it feasible to 
execute them on the hybrid neurocomputer. 
4.1 The Remote Sensing Application 
The remote sensing problem is an inverse mapping problem that uses microwave energy 
in different bands as input to predict the water vapor content of the atmosphere at different 
altitudes. Water vapor content is a key parameter for predicting weather in the tropics and 
mid-latitudes (Kakar and Lambrigtsen, 1984). The application uses 12 inputs and 1 output. 
The system input is naturally in analog form, the result of amplified microwave signals, so 
no D to A conversion of input data is required. Others have used neural networks with 
success to perform a similar inverse mapping to predict the temperature gradient of the 
atmosphere (Motteler et al., 1993). Section 5 details the improved restfits of the RBF 
network over conventional methods. Since water vapor content is a very important 
comptment of climate models, improved results in predicted water vapor content means 
improved climate models. 
Remote sensing problems require satellite hardware where power consumptioxt is always a 
major constraint. The low-power nature of the hybrid network would allow the network to 
be placed on board a satellite. With future EOS missions requiring several thousand 
sensors, the on-board network would reduce the bandwidth requirements of the data being 
sent back to earth, allowing the reduced water vapor content data to be transmitted rather 
than the raw sensor data. This data bandwidth reduction could be used either to send back 
more meaningful data to further improve climate models, or to reduce the mount of data 
transmitted, saving energy. 
4.2 The Mackey-Glass Application 
The Mackey-Glass chaotic time series application uses several previous time sample 
values to predict the current value of a time series which was generated by the Mackey- 
Glass delay-difference equation. It was used because it has proved to be difficult for 
854 Watkins, Chau, Tawel, Lambrigsten, and Plutowski 
sigmoidal neural networks (Platt, 1991). The application uses 4 inputs and 1 output. The 
Mackey-Glass time series is representative of time series found in medical apphcations 
such as detecting arrh_hmias in heartbeats. It could be advantageous to implement this 
application with portable hardware. 
4.3 The Speech Phoneme Recognition Application 
The speech phoneme recognition problem used the same data as Waibel (Waibel et al., 
1989) to learn to recognize the acoustically similar phoneroes of b, d and g. The 
application uses 240 inputs and 3 outputs. The speech phoneme recogni
