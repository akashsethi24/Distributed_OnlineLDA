Abstract 
A model of motion detection is presented. The model contains 
three stages. The first stage is unoriented and is selective for con- 
trast polarities. The next two stages work in parallel. A phase 
insensitive stage pools across different contrast polarities through 
a spatiotemporal filter and thus can detect first and second order 
motion. A phase sensitive stage keeps contrast polarities separate, 
each of which is filtered through a spatiotemporal filter, and thus 
only first order motion can be detected. Differential phase sensitiv- 
ity can therefore account for the detection of first and second order 
motion. Phase insensitive detectors correspond to cortical complex 
cells, and phase sensitive detectors to simple cells. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
In our environment objects are constantly in motion, and the visual system faces 
the task of identifying the motion of objects. This task can be subdivided into two 
components: motion detection and motion integration. In this study we will look at 
motion detection. Recent psychophysics has made a useful distinction between first 
and second order motion. In first order motion an absolute image feature is moving. 
For example, a bright bar moving on a dark background is an absolute feature 
because luminance is moving. In second order motion a relative image feature is 
moving, for example a contrast reversing bar. No longer is it possible to identify 
the moving object through its luminance, but only that it has different luminance 
with respect to the background. Humans are very sensitive to first order motion, 
but can they detect second order motion? Chubb & Sperling (1988) showed that 
subjects are in fact able to detect second order motion. These findings have since 
been confirmed in many psychophysical experiments, and it has become clear that 
the parameters that yield detection of first and second order motion are different, 
suggesting that separate motion detection systems exist.

1.1 Detection of first and second order motion 
First order motion, which is what we encounter in our daily lives, can be easily 
detected by finding the peak in the Fourier energy distribution. The motion energy 
detector developed by Adelson &: Bergen (1985) does this explicitly, and it turns 
out that it is also equivalent to a Reichardt detector (van Santen &: Sperling, 1985). 
However, these detectors cannot adequately detect second order motion, because 
second order motion stimuli often contain the maximum Fourier energy in the op- 
posite direction (possibly at a different velocity) as the actual motion. In other 
words, purely linear filters, should have opposite directional tuning for first and 
second order motion. This is further illustrated in Figure 1.

Figure 1: Schematic of first and second order motion, their peak Fourier energy, 
and the reconstruction. The peak Fourier energy is along the direction of motion 
for first order motion, and in the opposite direction for second order motion. For 
this reason a linear filter cannot detect second order motion. 
One way to account for second order motion detection is to transform the second 
order motion signal into a first order signal. If second order motion is defined by 
contrast reversals, then detecting contrast edges and then rectifying the resulting 
signal of contrast will yield a first order motion signal. Thus this approach includes 
three steps: orientation detection, rectification and finally motion detection (Wilson 
et al., 1992).

1.2 Visual physiology 
Cells in the retina and the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) have concentric (and 
hence unoriented) receptive fields which are organized in an opponent manner. 
While the center of such an ON cell is excited by a light increment, the surround is 
excited by a light decrement, and vice versa for OFF cells. It is only at the cortex 
that direction and orientation selectivity arise. Cortical simple cells are sensitive to 
the phase of the stimulus, while complex cells are not (Hubel & Wiesel, 1962). 
Most motion models take at least partial inspiration from known physiology and 
anatomy, by relating the kernels of the motion detectors to the physiology of corti- 
cal cells. The motion energy model in particular detects orientation and first order 
motion at the same time. Curiously, all motion models essentially ignore the concen- 
tric opponency of receptive fields in the LGN. This is usually justified by pointing 
to the linearity of simple cells with respect to stimulus parameters. However, it 
has been shown that simple cells in fact exhibit strong nonlinearities (Hammond 
& MacKay, 1983). Moreover, motion detection does require at least one stage of 
nonlinearity (Poggio & Reichardt, 1973). The present study develops a model of 
first and second order motion detection which explicitly includes an unoriented pro- 
cessing stage, and phase sensitive and phase insensitive motion detectors are built 
from these unoriented signals. The former set of detectors only responds to first 
order motion, while the second set of detectors responds to both types of motion. 
We further show the analogies that can be drawn between these detector types and 
simple and complex cells in cat visual cortex. 
2 MODEL DESCRIPTION 
The model is two-dimensional, one dimension is space, which means that space has 
been collapsed onto a line, and the other dimension is time. The input image to 
the model is a space-time matrix of luminances, as shown in figure 1. At each 
processing stage essentially the same operations are performed. First the input 
signal is convolved with the appropriate kernel. At each stage there are multiple 
kernels, to generate the different signal types at that stage. For example, there 
are ON and OFF signals at the unoriented stage. Next the convolved responses 
are subtracted from each other. At the unoriented stage this means ON-OFF and 
OFF-ON. In the final step these results are half-wave rectified to only yield positive 
silthalS.

(right plot) kernel plots black indicates OFF regions, white ON regions, and grey

and black denotes zero input.

At the unoriented stage the input pattern is convolved with a difference of Gaus- 
sians kernel. This kernel has only a spatial dimension, no temporal dimension (see 
figure 2). As described earlier, competition is between ON and OFF signals, fol- 
lowed by half-wave rectification. This ensures that at each location only one set of 
unoriented signals is present. A simulation of the signals at the unoriented stage is 
shown in figure 3. For first order motion, ON signals are at locations corresponding 
to the inside of the moving bar. With each shift of the bar the signals also move. 
Similarly, the OFF signals correspond to the outside of the bar, and also move with 
the bar. For second order motion the contrast polarity reverses. Thus ON signals 
correspond to the inside when the bar is bright, and to the outside when the bar is 
dark, and vice versa for OFF signals. Thus any ON or OFF signals to the leading 
edge of the bar will remain active after the bar moves.

Figure 3: Unoriented signals to first and second order motion. ON signals are at 
the bright side of any contrast transition, while OFF signals are at the dark side. 
In first order motion ON and OFF move synchronously to the moving stimulus. In 
second order motion ON and OFF signals persist, since the leading edge becomes 
the trailing edge, and at the same time the contrast reverses, which means that at 
a particular spatial location the contrast remains constant. 
At the phase insensitive stage the unoriented ON and OFF signals are added, and 
then the result is convolved with an energy detection filter.- The pooling of ON 
and OFF signals means that the contrast transitions in the image are essentially 
full-wave rectified. This causes phase insensitivity. These pooled signals are then 
convolved with a space-time oriented filter (see figure 2). Competition between op- 
posite directions of motion ensures that only one direction is active. A consequence 
of the pooling of unoriented ON and OFF signals at this stage is that the result- 
ing signals are invariant to first or second order motion. Thus phase insensitivity 
Detection of First and Seco nd 0 rder Motion 805 
makes this stage able to detect both first and second order motion. These signals 
are shown in figure 4. In a two-dimensional extension of this model these detectors 
would also be orientation selective. The simplest way to obtain this would be via 
elongation along the preferred orientation.
