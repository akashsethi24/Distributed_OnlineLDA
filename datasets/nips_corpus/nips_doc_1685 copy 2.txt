Abstract 
In a Bayesian mixture model it is not necessary a priori to limit the num- 
ber of components to be finite. In this paper an infinite Gaussian mixture 
model is presented which neatly sidesteps the difficult problem of find- 
ing the right number of mixture components. Inference in the model is 
done using an efficient parameter-free Markov Chain that relies entirely 
on Gibbs sampling. 
1 Introduction 
One of the major advantages in the Bayesian methodology is that overfitting is avoided; 
thus the difficult task of adjusting model complexity vanishes. For neural networks, this 
was demonstrated by Neal [ 1996] whose work on infinite networks led to the reinvention 
and popularisation of Gaussian Process models [Williams & Rasmussen, 1996]. In this 
paper a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) implementation of a hierarchical infinite 
Gaussian mixture model is presented. Perhaps surprisingly, inference in such models is 
possible using finite amounts of computation. 
Similar models are known in statistics as Dirichlet Process mixture models and go back 
to Ferguson [1973] and Antoniak [1974]. Usually, expositions start from the Dirichlet 
process itself [West et al, 1994]; here we derive the model as the limiting case of the well- 
known finite mixtures. Bayesian methods for mixtures with an unknown (finite) number 
of components have been explored by Richardson & Green [ 1997], whose methods are not 
easily extended to multivariate observations. 
2 Finite hierarchical mixture 
The finite Gaussian mixture model with k components may be written as: 
k 
P(/Ii,--' ,k,$1,... ,$k,71'1,... ,71'k)-- Z71'jJV'(j,$j-1), (1) 
j=l 
where/j are the means, sj the precisions (inverse variances), 7rj the mixing proportions 
(which must be positive and sum to one) and iV' is a (normalised) Gaussian with specified 
mean and variance. For simplicity, the exposition will initially assume scalar observations, 
n of which comprise the training data y -- {y,... , Yn}. First we will consider these 
models for a fixed value of k, and later explore the properties in the limit where k --> oc.

Gibbs sampling is a well known technique for generating samples from complicated mul- 
tivariate distributions that is often used in Monte Carlo procedures. In its simplest form, 
Gibbs sampling is used to update each variable in turn from its conditional distribution 
given all other variables in the system. It can be shown that Gibbs sampling generates sam- 
ples from the joint distribution, and that the entire distribution is explored as the number of 
Gibbs sweeps grows large. 
We introduce stochastic indicator variables, ci, one for each observation, whose role is to 
encode which class has generated the observation; the indicators take on values 1... k. 
Indicators are often referred to as missing data in a mixture model context. 
In the following sections the priors on component parameters and hyperparameters will 
be specified, and the conditional distributions for these, which will be needed for Gibbs 
sampling, will be derived. In general the form of the priors are chosen to have (hopefully) 
reasonable modelling properties, with an eye to mathematical convenience (through the use 
of conjugate priors). 
2.1 Component parameters 
The component means,/j, are given Gaussian priors: 
p(/jlX, r) ,-, Af(A, r-x), (2) 
whose mean, ,k, and precision, r, are hyperparameters common to all components. The 
hyperparameters themselves are given vague Normal and Gamma priors: 
p(,k) A/'(y, ay2), p(r) (1,-2 r-W2exp(_ray2/2), (3) 
2 are the mean and variance of the observations . The shape parameter of 
where/y and ay 
the Gamma prior is set to unity, corresponding to a very broad (vague) distribution. 
The conditional posterior distributions for the means are obtained by multiplying the like- 
lihood from eq. (1) conditioned on the indicators, by the prior, eq. (2): 
p(/ujlc, y, sj,X,r)  jf(jrtjsj + Xr 1 ) 1 >. Yi, (4) 
rtj $j q- r ' rtj $j q- r ' J ---- nj  
i:ci----j 
where the occupation number, n j, is the number of observations belonging to class j, and 
j is the mean of these observations. For the hyperparameters, eq. (2) plays the role of 
the likelihood which together with the priors from eq. (4) give conditional posteriors of 
standard form: 
A/'( trytry2 q-  E:i J 
try-2 + kr 
1 ) 
try + kr 
(5) 
P(rlfil,...,fi k ,) ,. (k q- 1, [.1_ (try2 + E(j _ X)2)]-). 
 k+l 
j=l 
The component precisions, $j, are given Gamma priors: 
p(sjl3, w ) ,, O(3, w-), (6) 
whose shape, , and mean, w -, are hypeameters coon to all components, with 
priors of inverse Gaa and Gaa form: 
p(-)G(1,1)p()m-a/2exp(-1/(2)), p(w)G(1, a). (7) 
Stfictly spewing, the priors ought not to depend on the observations. The cent procede is 
equivflent to normrising the obseations d using unit priors. A wide vety of reasonable priors 
will lead to sil results.

The conditional posterior precisions are obtained by multiplying the likelihood from eq. (1) 
conditioned on the indicators, by the prior, eq. (6): 
1 
p(sSIc, y, ttS,/?, w) -,, O(/? + nj, [/? + n---. (w/? + E (Y'- tt5)2)]-1) ' 
i:ci=j 
(8) 
For the hyperparameters, eq. (6) plays the role of likelihood which together with the priors 
from eq. (7) give: 
k 
( ) 
p(wlsl,..., s,3)  G k + 1, [k3 + I Y ' 
j=l 
P(/[$1, . . . ,$k, W) O(F(-) 
k 
exp ( )( )(a-a)/2 H(sjw)a/2 exp( 2 )' 
(9) 
The latter density is not of standard form, but it can be shown that p(log(/)lsl,..., sk, w) 
is log-concave, so we may generate independent samples from the distribution for log(/) 
using the Adaptive Rejection Sampling (ARS) technique [Gilks & Wild, 1992], and trans- 
form these to get values for/. 
The mixing proportions, 7rj, are given a symmetric Dirichlet (also known as multivariate 
beta) prior with concentration parameter a/k: 
II , 
p(7rl,... ,7rklc )  Dirichlet(c/k,... ,a/k) = F(c/k) j=l 
(10) 
where the mixing proportions must be positive and sum to one. Given the mixing propor- 
tions, the prior for the occupation numbers, n, is multinomial and the joint distribution of 
the indicators becomes: 
p(Cl,... ,Ck17r1,... ,7rk) -- 
k n 
Tj = E (JKronecker(Ci,j). (11) 
j=l i=1 
Using the standard Dirichlet integral, we may integrate out the mixing proportions and 
write the prior directly in terms of the indicators: 
p(cl,... f (12) 
k 
f II + 
= r(/) k 5+/k-ldj -- r( + ) j=l 
j=l 
In order to be able to use Gibbs sampling for the (discrete) indicators, ci, we need the 
conditional prior for a single indicator given all the others; this is easily obtained from 
eq. (12) by keeping all but a single indicator fixed: 
p(ci -- jlc_i,c) - n_,a + c/k (13) 
n-l+c 
where the subscript -i indicates all indexes except i and n-i,j is the number of observa- 
tions, excluding Yi, that are associated with component j. The posteriors for the indicators 
are derived in the next section. 
Lastly, a vague prior of inverse Gamma shape is put on the concentration parameter 
p(c-l)  (1, 1) ?p(o)cro-3/2exp(-1/(2o)). (14) 
The Infinite Gaussian Mixture Model 557 
The likelihood for a may be derived from eq. (12), which together with the prior from 
eq. (14) gives: 
akr(a) p(alk, n) cr ak-a/2 exp(- 1/(2a))r(a) (15) 
= + + 
Notice, that the conditional posterior for a depends only on number of observations, n, and 
the number of components, k, and not on how the observations are distributed among the 
components. The distribution p(log(a)Ik, n) is log-concave, so we may efficiently generate 
independent samples from this distribution using ARS. 
3 The infinite limit 
So far, we have considered k to be a fixed finite quantity. In this section we will explore 
the limit k --> oc and make the final derivations regarding the conditional posteriors for 
the indicators. For all the model variables except the indicators, the conditional posteriors 
for the infinite limit is obtained by substituting for k the number of classes that have data 
associated with them, krep, in the equations previously derived for the finite model. For the 
indicators, letting k --> oc in eq. (13), the conditional prior reaches the following limits: 
components where n-i,j > 0: p(ci = jlc-i, a) = 
all other compo- p(ci  ci, for all i'  ilc-, a) - 
nents combined: 
n-i,j 
n-l+a 
a (16) 
n-l+a 
This shows that the conditional class prior for components that are associated with other 
observations is proportional to the number of such observations; the combined prior for 
all other classes depends only on a and n. Notice how the analytical tractability of the 
integral in eq. (12) is essential, since it allows us to work directly with the (finite number 
of) indicator variables, rather than the (infinite number of) mixing proportions. We may 
now combine the likelihood from eq. (1) conditioned on the indicators with the prior from 
eq. (16) to obtain the conditional posteriors for the indicators: 
components for which rt_i,j > 0: p(ci -- tj, Sj, a) oc (17) 
p(ci = jlc-i,a)p(yil/j,sj,c-i) cr n-i, s}/2exp( - sj(yi - /j)2/2), 
n-l+a 
all other components combined: p(ci  ci, for all i  i'Ic_i, A, r, , w, a) oc 
p(ci  ci, for all i  i'fc_i,a ) / p(yi]/j, sj )p(uj, sj[A, r, , w)djdsj. 
The likelihood for components with observations other than yi currently associated with 
them is Gaussian with component parameters/j and sj. The likelihood pertaining to the 
currently unrepresented classes (which have no parameters associated with them) is ob- 
tained through integration over the prior distribution for these. Note, that we need not 
differentiate between the infinitely many unrepresented classes, since their parameter dis
