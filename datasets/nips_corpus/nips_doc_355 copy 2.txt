Abstract 
In salamander retina, the response of On-Off ganglion cells to a central 
flash is reduced by movement in the receptive field surround. Through 
computer simulation of a 2-D model which takes into account their 
anatomical and physiological properties, we show that interactions 
between four neuron types (two bipolar and two amacrine) may be 
responsible for the generation and lateral conductance of this change 
sensitive inhibition. The model shows that the four neuron circuit can 
account for previously observed movement sensitive reductions in 
ganglion cell sensitivity and allows visualization and prediction of the 
spatio-temporal pattern of activity in change sensitive retinal cells. 
INTRODUCTION 
In the salamander retina, the response of transient (On-Off) ganglion cells to a central 
flash is reduced by movement in the receptive field surround (Werblin, 1972; Werblin & 
Copenhagen, 1974) as illustrated in Fig 1. This phenomenon requires the detection of 
change in the surround and the lateral transmission of this change sensitive inhibition to 
the ganglion cell dendrites. Wunk & Werblin (1979) showed that all ganglion cells 
receive change-sensitive inhibition, and Barnes & Werblin (1987) implicated a change- 
sensitive amacrine cell with widely distributed processes. The change-sensitivity of these 
amacrine cells has been traced in part to a truncation of synaptic release from the bipolar 
terminals that presumably drive them (Maguire et al., 1989). The transient response of 
these amacrine cells, mediated by voltage gated currents (Barnes & Werblin, 1986; Eliasof 
et al., 1987) also contributes to this change sensitivity. 
These and other experiments suggest that interactions between four neuron types underlie 
both the change detection and the lateral transmission of inhibition (Werblin et al., 1988; 
Maguire et al., 1989). To test this hypothesis and make predictions that could be 
compared with later experiments we have constructed a computational model of the four 
neuron circuit and incorporated it into an overall model of the retina. This model allows 
us to simulate the effect of inhibition generated by the four neuron circuit on ganglion 
cells.

2 IMPLEMENTING THE HYPOTHETICAL CIRCUIT 
The proposed change-sensitive circuit (Werblin et al., 1988; Maguire et al., 1989) is 
reproduced in Figure 2. This is meant to describe a very local region of the retina where 
the receptive fields of the two bipolar cells are spatially overlapping. When a visual 
target enters this receptive field, the bipolar cells are both depolarized. The sustained 
bipolar cell activates the narrow field amacrine cell that, in turn feeds back to the synaptic 
terminal of the transient bipolar cell to truncate transmitter release after a brief (ca. 100 
msec) delay. Because the signal reaching the wide field amacrine cell is truncated after 
about 100 msec, the wide field amacrine cell will receive excitation when the target enters 
the receptive field, but will not continue to respond in the presence of the target. 
The spatial profiles of synaptic input and output for the cell types involved in the model 
are summarized in Figure 3. The bipolar and narrow field amacrine cell sensitivities 
extend over a region corresponding roughly to their dendrific spread. The wide field 
amacrine cell appears to receive input over a local region near the cell body, but delivers 
its inhibitory output over a much wider region corresponding the the full extent (ca. 500 
mm) of its processes. 
Figure 4 shows the electrical circuit model for each cell type, and illustrates the 
interactions between cells that are implemented in the model. In Figure 4, boxes contain 
the circuit for each cell and arrows between them represent synaptic interactions thought

to occur as determined through experiments in which a neurotransmitter is puffed onto 
bipolar dendrites. Bipolar cells are modeled using two compartments, corresponding to 
the cell body and axon terminal as suggested in Maguire et al. (1989). Amacrine cells are 
modeled using only one compartment as in Eliasof et al. (1987). 
Each compartment has a voltage (Vbs, Vbst, Vbtt, Van, Vaw). The cell body for the 
sustained and transient bipolar are assumed to be the same. Batteries in the figure 
correspond to excitatory (E+, Ena) or inhibitory reversal potentials (E-, Ek, Ecl). 
Resistors represent ionic conductances. Circles and arrows through resisters indicate 
n'ansmitter dependent conductances which are controlled by the voltage of a presynapfic or 
same cell. Functions relating voltages to conductances are mostly linear with a threshold. 
More details are given in Teeters et al. (1991).

3 TESTING THE COMPUTATIONAL MODEL 
Computer simulation was used to tune model parameters, and test whether the single cell 
properties and proposed interactions between cells shown in Figure 4 are consistent with 
the responses recorded from the neurons during applications of a neurotransmitter puff. 
Results are shown in Figure 5. Voltage clamp experiments electrically clamp the cell 
membrane potential to a constant voltage and determine the current required to maintain 
the voltage over time. Downward traces indicate that current is flowing into the cell; 
upward traces indicate outward current. For simplicity, scales are not shown, but in all 
cases the magnitude of the simulated response is close to that of the observed response. 
The simulated and observed responses voltage clamps of the wide field amacrine shown in 
the fourth row vary because there is a sustained outward current observed experimentally 
that is not apparent in the simulations. This shows that the model is not perfect and is 
something that needs further investigation. 
This difference between the model and observed response does not prevent the 
hypothesized function of the circuit from being simulated. This is shown on the bottom 
row where both the observed and simulated voltage responses from the wide field amacrine 
are transient.

Figure 5 illustrates that we have, to a large degree, succeeded in combining the 
characteristics of single cells into a model which can explain many of the observed 
properties thought to be due to the interaction between these cells in a local region.

The next step in our analysis is to investigate how this circuit influences the response of 
ganglion cells. To do this requires simulating the input to the bipolar dendrites and 
simulating the ganglion cells which receive the transient inhibition generated by the wide 
field amacrine. This amounts to a integrated model of an entire patch of retina, including 
receptors, horizontal cells, the four neuron circuit discussed earlier, and ganglion cells. 
The manner in which we accomplish this is illustrated in Figure 6. 
The left side of figure 6 shows the model elements. Receptors and horizontal cells are 
modeled as low pass filters with different time constants and different spatial inputs. The 
ganglion cell model receives a transient excitatory input generated phenomenologically by 
a thresholded high pass filter from the transient bipolar. Inhibitory input to the ganglion 
cell is implemented as coming from the transient wide field amacrine cells described 
previously. For simplicity, voltage gated currents and spiking are not implemented in the 
ganglion cell model, and only the off bipolar pathways are simulated. 
The right hand of Figure 6 illustrates how the model is implemented spatially. The 
circuit for each cell type is duplicated across the retina patch in a matrix format. The 
known spatial properties of each cell, such as the spatial range of transmitter sensitivity 
and release are incorporated into the model. Details are given in Teeters et al. 1991. 
5 SIMULATING INHIBITION TO GANGLION CELLS 
To test if the model can account for the observed reduction in ganglion cell response 
during movement in the receptive field surround, we simulated the experiment depicted in 
Figure 1, mainly the flashing of a central light during the presence of a stationary and 
spinning windmill. The results are shown in Figure 7.
