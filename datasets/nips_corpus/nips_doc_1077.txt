Abstract 
We analyse the geometry of eye rotations, and in particular 
saccarles, using basic Lie group theory and differential geome- 
try. Various parameterizations of rotations are related through 
a unifying mathematical treatment, and transformations between 
co-ordinate systems are computed using the Campbell-Baker- 
Hausdorff formula. Next, we describe Listing's law by means of 
the Lie algebra so(3). This enables us to demonstrate a direct 
connection to Dontiers' law, by showing that eye orientations are 
restricted to the quotient space S0(3)/S0(2). The latter is equiv- 
alent to the sphere $2, which is exactly the space of gaze directions. 
Our analysis provides a mathematical framework for studying the 
oculomotor system and could also be extended to investigate the 
geometry of multi-joint arm movements. 
I INTRODUCTION 
1.1 SACCADES AND LISTING'S LAW 
Saccades are fast eye movements, bringing objects of interest into the center of 
the visual field. It is known that eye positions are restricted to a subset of those 
which are anatomically possible, both during saccarles and fixation (Tweed & Vilis, 
1990). According to Dontiers' law, the eye's gaze direction determines its orientation 
uniquely, and moreover, the brientation does not depend on the history of eye motion 
which has led to the given gaze direction. A precise specification of the allowed 
subspace of position is given by Listing's law: the observed orientations of the eye 
are those which can be reached from the distinguished orientation called primary

position through a single rotation about an axis which lies in the plane perpendicular 
to the gaze direction at the primary position (Listing's plane). We say then that 
the orientation of the eye has zero torsion. Recently, the domain of validity of 
Listing's law has been extended to include eye vergence by employing a suitable 
mathematical treatment (Van Rijn & Van Den Berg, 1993). 
Tweed and Vilis used quaternion calculus to demonstrate, in addition, that in order 
to move from one allowed position to another in a single rotation, the rotation axis 
itself lies outside Listing's plane (Tweed & Vilis, 1987). Indeed, normal saccarles are 
performed approximately about a single axis. However, the validity of Listing's law 
does not depend on the rotation having a single axis, as was shown in double-step 
target displacement experiments (Minken, Van Opstal & Van Gisbergen, 1993): 
even when the axis of rotation itself changes during the saccade, Listing's law is 
obeyed at each and every point along the trajectory which is traced by the eye. 
Previous analyses of eye rotations (and in particular of Listing's law) have been 
based on various representations of rotations: quaternions (Westheimer, 1957), ro- 
tation vectors (Hepp, 1990), spinors (Hestenes, 1994) and 3 x 3 rotation matrices; 
however, they are all related through the same underlying mathematical object -- 
the three dimensional (3D) rotation group. In this work we analyse the geometry of 
saccarles using the Lie algebra of the rotation group and the group structure. Next, 
we briefly describe the basic mathematical notions which will be needed later. This 
is followed by Section 2 in which we analyse various parameterizations of rotations 
from the point of view of group theory; Section 3 contains a detailed mathematical 
analysis of Listing's law and its connection to Dontiers' law based on the group 
structure; in Section 4 we briefly discuss the issue of angular velocity vectors or 
axes of rotation ending with a short conclusion. 
1.2 THE ROTATION GROUP AND ITS LIE ALGEBRA 
The group of rotations in three dimensions, G = $0(3), (where 'SO' stands for 
special orthogonal transformations) is used both to describe actual rotations and 
to denote eye positions by means of a unique virtual rotation from the primary 
position. The identity operation leaves the eye at the primary position, therefore, 
we identify this position with the unit element of the group e  SO(3). A rotation 
can be parameterized by a 3D axis and the angle of rotation about it. Each axis 
generates a continuous set of rotations through increasing angles. Formally, if n 
is a unit axis of rotation, then 
EXP(0 � n) (1) 
is a continuous one-parameter subgroup (in G) of rotations through angles 0 in the 
plane that is perpendicular to n. Such a subgroup is denoted as SO(2) C SO(3). 
We can take an explicit representation of n as a matrix and the exponent can 
be calculated as a Taylor series expansion. Let us look, for example, at the one 
parameter subgroup of rotations in the y-z plane, i.e. rotations about the x axis 
which is represented in this case by the matrix

A direct computation of this rotation by an angle 0 gives

where I is the identity matrix. Thus, the rotation matrix R(O) can be constructed 
from the axis and angle of rotation. The same rotation, however, could also be 
achieved using L instead of L, where  is any scalar, while rescaling the angle 
to 0/. The collection of matrices L is a one dimensional linear space whose 
elements are the generators of rotations in the y-z plane. 
The set of all the generators constitutes the Lie algebra of a group. For the full 
space of 3D rotations, the Lie algebra is the three dimensional vector space that is 
spanned by the standard orthonormal basis comprising the three direction vectors 
of the principal axes: 
g = so(3) = Span{e, %, e ). (4) 
Every axis n can be expressed as a linear combination of this basis. Elements of 
the Lie algebra can also be represented in matrix form and the corresponding basis 
for the matrix space is 
L = 0 1 L u = 0 0 L, = - 0 0 ; 
0 - 0 - 0 0 0 0 0 
(5) 
hence we have the isomorphism 
-0, 0 0 , , 0 u . (6) 
-0y -0 0 
Thanks to its linear structure, the Lie algebra is often more convenient for analysis 
than the group itself. In addition to the linear structure, the Lie algebra has a 
bilinear antisymmetric operation defined between its elements which is called the 
bracket or commutator. The bracket operation between vectors in g is the usual 
vector cross product. When the elements of the Lie algebra are written as matrices, 
the bracket operation becomes a commutation relation, i.e. 
[A, B] = AB- BA. (7) 
As expected, the commutation relations of the basis matrices of the Lie algebra (of 
the 3D rotation group) are equivalent to the vector product: 
[Li, Lj] = ,jkLk (8) 
Finally, in accordance with (1), every rotation matrix is obtained by exponentiation: 
R(0) = EXP(0L +OyLy +OzL,). (9) 
where 0 stands for the three component angles. 
2 CO-ORDINATE SYSTEMS FOR ROTATIONS 
In linear spaces the position of a point is simply parameterized by the co-ordinates 
w.r.t. the principal axes (a chosen orthonormal basis). For a non-linear space (such 
as the rotation group) we define local co-ordinate charts that look like pieces of 
a vector space ll . Several co-ordinate systems for rotations are based on the 
fact that group elements can be written as exponents of elements of the Lie al- 
gebra (1). The angles 0 appearing in the exponent serve as the co-ordinates. 
The underlying property which is essential for comparing these systems is the non- 
commutativity of rotations. For usual real numbers, e.g. Cl and c2, commutativ- 
ity implies exp c exp c = exp c+c. A corresponding equation for non-commuting 
elements is the Campbell-Baker-Hausdorff formula (CBH) which is a Taylor series

expansion using repeated commutators between the elements of the Lie algebra. 
The expansion to third order is (Choquet-Bruhat et al., 1982): 
EXP(x)EXP(x2) = EXP(x +x2+ [x, x2] + 2[x- x2, [x, x2]]) (10) 
where zl, z2 are variables that stand for elements of the Lie algebra. 
One natural parameterization uses the representation of a rotation by the axis and 
the angle of rotation. The angles which appear in (9) are then called canonical 
co-ordinates of the first kind (Varadarajan, 1974). Gimbal systems constitute a 
second type of parameterization where the overall rotation is obtained by a series 
of consecutive rotations about the principal axes. The component angles are then 
called canonical co-ordinates of the second kind. In the present context, the first 
type of co-ordinates are advantageous because they correspond to single axis rota- 
tions which in turn represent natural eye movements. For convenience, we will use 
the name canonical co-ordinates for those of the first kind, whereas those of the 
second type will simply be called gimbals. The gimbals of Fick and Helmholtz are 
commonly used in the study of oculomotor control (Van Opstal, 1993). A rotation 
matrix in Fick gimbals is 
RF(O,Oy,O,)=EXP(O,L,) EXP(OyLy) EXP(0L), 
(11) 
and in Helmholtz gimbals the order of rotations is different: 
RH(O,Oy,Oz) = EXP(OyLy) � EXP(0, L,) EXP(0L). (12) 
The CBH formula (10) can be used as a general tool for obtaining transformations 
between various co-ordinate systems (Gilmore, 1974) such as (9,11,12). In particu- 
lar, we apply (10) to the product of the two right-most terms in (11) and then again 
to the product of the result with the third term. We thus arrive at an expression 
whose form is the same as the right hand side of (10). By equating it with the 
expression for canonical angles (9) and then taking the log of the exponents on 
both sides of the equation, we obtain the transformation formula from Fick angles 
to canonical angles. Repeating this calc
