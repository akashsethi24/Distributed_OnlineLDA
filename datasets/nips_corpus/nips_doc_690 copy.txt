Abstract 
The planar thallium-201 myocardial perfusion scintigram is a widely used 
diagnostic technique for detecting and estimating the risk of coronary 
artery disease. Neural networks learned to interpret 100 thallium scinti- 
grams as determined by individual expert ratings. Standard error back- 
propagation was compared to standard LMS, and LMS combined with 
one layer of RBF units. Using the leave-one-out method, generaliza- 
tion was tested on all 100 cases. Training time was determined automati- 
cally from cross-validation performance. Best performance was attained 
by the RBF/LMS network with three hidden units per view and compares 
favorably with human experts. 
1 Introduction 
Coronary artery disease (CAD) is one of the leading causes of death in the Western World. 
The planar thallium-201 is considered to be a reliable diagnostic tool in the detection of

CAD. Thallium is a radioactive isotope that distributes in mammalian tissues after interve- 
nous administration and is imaged by a gamma camera. The resulting scintigram is visually 
interpreted by the physician for the presence or absence of defects -- areas with relatively 
lower perfusion levels. In myocardial applications, thallium is used to measure myocardial 
ischemia and to differentiate between viable and non-viable (infarcted) heart muscle (Po- 
host and Henzlova, 1990). 
Diagnosis of CAD is based on the comparison of two sets of images, one set acquired 
immediately after a standard effort test (BRUCE protocol), and the second following a 
delay period of four hours. During this delay, the thallium redistributes in the heart muscle 
and spontaneously decays. Defects caused by scar tissue are relatively unchanged over 
the delay period (fixed defect), while those caused by ischemia are partially or completely 
filled-in (reversible defect) (Beller, 1991; Datz et al., 1992). 
Image interpretation is difficult for a number of reasons: the inherent variability in biolog- 
ical systems which makes each case essentially unique, the vast amount of irrelevant and 
noisy information in an image, and the context-dependency of the interpretation on data 
from many other tests and clinical history. Interpretation can also be significantly affected 
by attentional shifts, perceptual abilities, and mental state (Franken Jr. and Berbaum, 1991; 
Cnar6n et al., 1980). 
While networks have found considerable application in ECG processing (e.g. (Artis et al., 
1991)) and clinical decision-making (Baxt, 1991b; Baxt, 1991a), they have thus far found 
limited application in the field of nuclear medicine. Non-cardiac imaging applications in- 
clude the grading of breast carcinomas (Dawson et al., 1991) and the discrimination of nor- 
mal vs. Alzheimer's PET scans (Kippenhan et al., 1990). Of the studies dealing specifically 
with cardiac imaging, neural networks have been applied to several problems in cardiology 
including the identification of stenosis (Porenta et al., 1990; Cioset al., 1989; Cioset al., 
1991; Cianflone et al., 1990; Fujita et al., 1992). These studies encouraged us to explore 
the use of neural networks in the interpretation of cardiac scintigraphy. 
2 Methods 
We trained one network consisting of a layer of gaussian RBF units in an unsupervised fash- 
ion to discover features in circumferential profiles in planar thallium scinfigraphy. Then a 
second network was trained in a supervised way to map these features to physician's visual 
interpretations of those images using the delta rule (Widrow and Hoff, 1960). This archi- 
tecture was previously found to compare favorably to other network learning algorithms 
(2-layer backpropagation and single-layer networks) on this task (Rosenberg et al., 1993; 
Erel et al., 1993). 
In our experiments, all of the input vectors representing single views/were first normalized 
to unit length I7 ; The activation value of a gaussian unit, 05 , is then given by:

where j is an index to a gaussian unit and i is an input unit index. The width of the gaussian,

left lateral (LAT). The second layer consisted of radial basis function (RBF) units, the third 
layer, semi-linear units trained in a supervised fashion. The outputs of the network corre-

The gaussian units were mined using a competitive learning rule which moves the center 
of the unit closest to the current input pattern (O,a, i.e. the winner) closer to the input

2.1 Data Acquisition and Selection 
Scinfigraphic images were acquired for each of three views: anterior (ANT), left lateral 
oblique (LAO 45), and left lateral (LAT) for each patient case. Acquisition was performed 
twice, once immediately following a standard effort test and once following a delay period 
of four hours. Each image was pre-processed to produce a circumferential profile (Garcia 
et al., 1981; Francisco et al., 1982) , in which maximum pixel counts within each of 60, 
6 � contiguous segmental regions are plotted as a function of angle (Garcia, 1991). Pre- 
processing involved positioning of the region of interest (ROI), interpolative background 
subtraction, smoothing and rotational alignment to the heart's apex (Garcia, 1991). 
We have considered applying the learning rule to the unit widths (w) as well as the RBF weights, 
however we have not as yet pursued this possibility. 
2Following Rumelhart and Zipset (Rumelhart and Zipset, 1986), the other units were also pulled 
towards the input vector, although to a much smaller extent than the winner. We used a ratio of 1 to 
100. 
3The profiles were generated using the Elscint CTL software package for planar quantitative 
thallium-201 based on the Cedars-Sinai technique (Garcia et al., 1981; Maddahi et al., 1981; Areeda 
et al., 1982).

Table 1: Distribution of Abnormal Cases as Scored by the Expert Observer. Defects occur- 
ring in any combination of two or more regions (even the proximal and distal subregions 
of a single area) were treated as one multiple defect. The severity level of multiple lesions 
was based on the most severe lesion present. 
Cases were pre-selected based on the following criteria (Beller, 1991): 
� Insufficient exercise. Cases in which the heart rate was less than 130 b.p.m. were 
eliminated, as this level of stress is generally deemed insufficient to accurately 
distinguish normal from abnormal conditions. 
� Positional abnormalities. In a few cases, the region of interest was not posi- 
tioned or aligned correctly by the technician. 
� Increased lung uptake. Typically in cases of multi-vessel disease, a significant 
proportion of the perfusion occurs in the lungs as well as in the heart, making it 
more difficult to determine the condition of the heart due to the partially overlap- 
ping positions of the heart and lungs. 
� Breast artifacts. 
Cases were selected at random between August, 1989 and March, 1992. Approximately a 
third of the cases were eliminated due to insufficient heart rate, 4-5% due to breast artifacts, 
4% due to lung uptake, and 1-2% due to positional abnormalities. A set of one hundred 
usable cases remained. 
2.2 Visual Interpretation 
Each case was visually scored by a single expert observer for each of nine anatomical re- 
gions generally accepted as those that best relate to the coronary circulation: Septal: prox- 
imal and distal, Anterior: proximal and distal, Apex, Inferior: proximal and distal, and 
Posterior-Lateral: proximal and distal. Scoring for each region was from normal (1) to 
severe (4), indicating the level of the observed perfusion deficit. 
Intra-observer variability was examined by having the observer re-interpret 17 of the cases 
a second time. The observer was unable to remember the cases from the first reading and 
could not refer to the previous scores. 
Exact matches were obtained on 91.5% of the regions; only 8 of the 153 total regions (5%) 
were labeled as a defect (mild, moderate or severe) on one occasion and not on the other. 
All differences, when they occurred, were of a single rating level 4.

2.3 The Network Model 
The input units of the network were divided into 3 groups of 60 units each, each group 
representing the circumferential profile for a single view. A set of 3 RBF units were assigned 
to each input group. Then a second layer of weights was trained using the delta rule to 
reproduce the target visual scores assigned by the expert observer. The categori
