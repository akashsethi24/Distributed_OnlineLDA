Abstract 
The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) stabilizes images on the retina during rapid 
head motions. The gain of the VOR (the ratio of eye to head rotation velocity) 
is typically around -1 when the eyes are focused on a distant target. However, to 
stabilize images accurately, the VOR gain must vary with context (eye position, 
eye vergerice and head translation). We first describe a kinematic model of the 
VOR which relies solely on sensory information available from the semicircular 
canals (head rotation), the otoliths (head translation), and neural correlates of eye 
position and vergerice angle. We then propose a dynamical model and compare it 
to the eye velocity responses measured in monkeys. The dynamical model repro- 
duces the observed amplitude and time course of the modulation of the VOR and 
suggests one way to combine the required neural signals within the cerebellum and 
the brain stem. It also makes predictions for the responses of neurons to multiple 
inputs (head rotation and translation, eye position, etc.) in the oculomotor system. 
1 Introduction 
The VOR stabilizes images on the retina during rapid head motions: Rotations and translations of 
the head in three dimensions must be compensated by appropriate rotations of the eye. Because the 
head's rotation axis is not the same as the eye's rotation axis, the calculations for proper image stabi- 
lization of an object must take into account diverse variables such as object distance from each eye,

gaze direction, and head translation (Viire et al., 1986). The stabilization is achieved by integrating 
information from different sources: head rotations from the semicircular canals of the inner ear, head 
translations from the otolith organs, eye positions, viewing distance, as well as other context informa- 
tion, such as posture (head tilts) or activity (walking, running) (Snyder and King, 1992; Shelhamer 
et a1.,1992; Grossman et al., 1989). In this paper we concentrate on the context modulation of the 
VOR which can be described by the kinematics of the reflex, i.e. eye position, eye vergence and 
head translation.

The ideal VOR response is a compensatory eye movement which keeps the image fixed on the retina 
for any head rotations and translations. We therefore derived an equation for the eye rotation velocity 
by requiring that a target remains stationary on the retina. The velocity of the resulting compensatory 
eye rotation can be written as (see fig. 1): 
(1) 
where c is the head rotation velocity sensed by the semicircular canals, foj is the head translation 
velocity sensed by the otoliths, cj = (ff - 6j), ff is a constant vector specifying the location of an 
eye in the head, j is the position of either the left or right otolith, � and Igl are the unit vector and 
amplitude of the gaze vector: � gives the eye position (orientation of the eye relative to the head), 
and Igl gives the distance from the eye to the object, and the symbol x indicates the cross-product 
between two vectors.  and � are rotation vectors which describe the instantaneous angular velocity 
of the eye and head, respectively. A rotation vector lies along the instantaneous axis of rotation; 
its magnitude indicates the speed of rotation around the axis,_,and its direction is gven by the right- 
hand screw rule. A motion of the head combining rotation (f) and translation (T) is sensed as the 
combination of a rotation velocity ft� measured by the semicircular canals and a translation velocity 
fo sensed by the otoliths. The rotation vectors are equal (_. = c), and the translation velocity vector 
as measured by the otoliths is given by: 2noj = t./ x fl + f, where t./ _= ( - 3./), and  is the 
position vector of the axis of rotation. 
A Dynamical Model of Context Dependencies for the Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex 91 
The special case where the gaze is horizontal and the rotation vector is vertical (horizontal head ro- 
tation) has been studied extensively in the literature. We used this special case in the simulations. 
In that case  may,be simplify by writing its equation with dot products. Since � and � are then 
perpendicular (�. ft�= 0), the first term of the following expression in brackets is zero: 
1 
= + 17 - - X Vo] 
(2) 
The semicircular canals decompose and report acceleration and velocity of head rotation  by its 
components along the three canals on each side of the head c ' horizontal, anterior and posterior. 
The two otolith organs on each side report the dynamical inertial forces generated during linear mo- 
tion (translation) in two perpendicular plane, one vertical and the other horizontal relative to the head. 
Here we assume that a translation velocity signal (fo) derived from or reported by the otolith affer- 
ents is available. The otoliths encode as well the head orientation relative to the gravity vector force, 
but was not included in this study. 
To complete the correspondence between the equation and a neural correlate, we need to determine 
a physiological source for � and I-Y' The eye position � is assumed to be given by the output of the 
velocity-to-position transformation or so-called neural integrator which provides eye position in- 
fomarion and which is necessary for the activation of the motoneuron to sustain the eye in a fixed 
position. The integrator for horizontal eye position appears to be located in the nucleus prepositus 
hypoglossi in the pons, and the vertical integrator in the midbrain interstitial nucleus of Cajal. (Craw- 
ford, Cadera and Vilis, 1991; Cannon and Robinson, 1987). We assume that the eye position is given 
as the coordinates of the unit vector � along the/x and  of fig. 1. The eye position depends on the 
eye velocity according to - = � x 3. For the special case (t) = w(t), i.e. for horizontal head 
rotation, the eye position coordinates are given by: 
(t) = (0) + f2 
9(t) = 9(0) - f2 
(3) 
This is a set of two negatively coupled integrators. The neural integrator therefore does not inte- 
grate the eye velocity directly but a product of eye position and eye velocity. The distance from eye 
1 
to target I- can be written using the gaze angles in the horizontal plane of the head: 
 sin(On - 0L) 1 sec(0L) sin(On - 0) (4) 
Right eye: 1--[ = Icos(0/) =7 
Left eye:  _ sin(On - 0) 1 sec(0n) sin(On - 0) (5) 
177[ - I cos(On) = 7 
where (On - 0) is the vergence angle, and I is the interocular distance; the angles are measured from 
a straight ahead gaze, and take on negative values when the eyes are turned towards the right. Within 
the oculomotor system, the vergence angle and speed are encoded by the mesencephalic reticular 
formation neurons (Judge and Cumming, 1986; Mays, 1984). The nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis 
with reciprocal connections to the flocculus, oculomotor vermis, paravermis of the cerebellum also 
contains neurons which activity varies linearly with vergence angle (Gamlin and Clarke, 1995). 
We conclude that it is possible to perform the computations needed to obtain an ideal VOR with sig- 
nals known to be available physiologically.

Figure 2: Anatomical connections considered in the dynamical model. Only the left side is shown, the right 
side is identical and connected to the left side only for the calculation of vergence angle. The nucleus prepositus 
hypoglossi and the nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis are meant to be representative of a class of nuclei in the 
brain stem carrying eye position or vergence signal. All connections are known to exist except the connection 
between the prepositus nucleus to the reticularis nucleus which has not been verified. Details of the cerebellum 
are in fig. 3 and of the vestibular nucleus in fig. 4. 
3 Dynamical Model 
Snyder & King (1992) studied the effect of viewing distance and location of the axis of rotation on 
the VOR in monkeys; their main results are reproduced in fig. 5. In an attempt to reproduce their 
data and to understand how the signals that we have described in section 2 may be combined in time, 
we constructed a dynamical model based on the kinematic model. Its basic anatomical structure is 
shown in fig. 2. Details of the model are shown in fig. 3, and fig. 4 where all constants are written 
using a millisecond time scale. The results are presented in fig. 5. The dynamical variables represent 
the change of average firing rate from resting level of activity. The firing rate of the afferents has a 
tonic component proportional to the velocity and a phasic component proportional to the acceleration 
of movement. Physiologically, the afferents have a wide range ofphasic and tonic amplitudes. This 
is reflected by a wide selection of parameters in the numerators in the boxes of fig. 3 and fig. 4. The 
Laplace transform of the integration operator in equation (3) of the eye position coordinates is
