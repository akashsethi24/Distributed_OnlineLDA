Abstract 
We discuss the development of a Multi-Layer Perceptron neural 
network classifier for use in preoperative differentiation between 
benign and malignemt ovarian tumors. As the Mean Squared clas- 
siftcation Error is not sufficient to make correct and objective as- 
sessments about the performance of the neural classifier, the con- 
cepts of sensitivity and specificity are introduced and combined 
in Receiver Operating Characteristic curves. Based on objective 
observations such as sonomorphologic criteria, color Doppler imag- 
ing and results from serum tumor markers, the neural network is 
able to make reliable predictions with a discriminating performemce 
comparable to that of experienced gynecologists. 
i Introduction 
A reliable test for preoperative discrimination between benign and malignant ovar- 
ian tumors would be of considerable help to clinicians. It would assist them to select 
patients for whom minimally invasive surgery or conservative management suffices 
versus those for whom urgent referral to a gynecologic oncologist is needed. 
We discuss the development of a neural network classifier/diagnostic tool. The neu- 
ral network was trained by supervised learning, based on data from 191 thoroughly 
examined patients presenting with ovarian tumors of which 140 were benign and 51 
malignant. As inputs to the network we chose indicators that in recent studies have 
proven their high predictive value [1, 2, 3]. Moreover, we gave preference to those 
indicators that can be obtained in an objective way by any gynecologist. Some of 
these indicators have already been used in attempts to make one single protocol or 
decision algorithm [3, 4].

In order to make reliable assessments on the practical performance of the classifier, 
it is necessary to work with other concepts than Mean Squared classification Error 
(MSE), which is traditionally used as a measure of goodness in the training of a 
neural network. We will introduce notions as specificity and sensitivity and combine 
them into Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. The use of ROC-curves 
is motivated by the fact that they are independent of the relative proportion of the 
various output classes in the sample population. This enables an objective validation 
of the performance of the classifier. We will also show how, in the training of the 
neural network, MSE optimization with gradient methods can be refined and/or 
replaced with the help of ROC-curves and simulated annealing techniques. 
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we give a brief description of the 
selected input features. In Section 3 we state some drawbacks to the MSE criterion 
and introduce the concepts of sensitivity, specificity and ROC-curves. Section 4 
then deals with the technicalities of training the neural network. In Section 5 we 
show the results and compare them to human performance. 
2 Data acquisition and feature selection 
The data were derived from a study group of 191 consecutive patients who were 
referred to a single institution (University Hospitals Leuven, Belgium) from August 
1994 to August 1996. Table 1 lists the different indicators which were considered, 
together with their mean value and standard deviations or together with the relative 
presence in cases of benign and malignant tumors. 
Table 1 Indicator Benign Malignant 
Demographic Age 49.3 + 16.0 58.3 + 14.3 
Postmenopausal 40% 70.6% 
Serum marker CA 125 (log) 2.8 + 1.1 5.2 + 1.9 
CDI Blood flow present 72.9% 100% 
Morphologic Abdominal fluid 12.1% 52.9% 
Bilateral mass 11.4% 35.3% 
Uniloculax cyst 42.1% 5.9% 
Multiloc/solid cyst 16.4% 49.0% 
Smooth wall 58.6% 2.0% 
Irregular wall 32.1% 76.5% 
Papillations 7.9% 74.5% 
Table 1: Demographic, serum marker, color Doppler imaging and morphologic indicators. 
For the continuous valued features the mean and standard deviation for each class are 
reported. For binary valued indicators, the last two columns give the presence of the 
feature in both classes e.g. only 2% of malignant tumors had smooth walls. 
First, all patients were scanned with ultrasonography to obtain detailed gray-scale 
images of the tumors. Every tumor was extensively examined for its morphologic 
characteristics. Table 1 lists the selected morphologic features: presence of ab- 
dominal fluid collection, papillary structures (> 3mm), smooth internal walls, wall 
irregularities, whether the cysts were unilocular, multilocular-solid and/or present 
on both pelvic sides. All outcomes are binary valued: every observation relates to 
the presence (1) or absence (0) of these characteristics. 
Secondly, all tumors were entirely surveyed by color Doppler imaging to detect 
presence or absence of blood flow within the septa, cyst walls, solid tumor areas or 
ovarian tissue. The outcome is also binary valued (1/0).

Thirdly, in 173 out of the total of 191 patients, serum CA 125 levels were measured, 
using CA 125 II immunoradiometric assays (Centocor, Malvern, PA). The CA 125 
antigen is a glycoprotein that is expressed by most epithelial ovarian cancers. The 
numerical value gives the concentration in U/ml. Because almost all values were 
situated in a small interval between 0 and 100, and because a small portion took 
values up to 30,000, this variable was rescaled by taking its logarithm. 
Since age and menopausal status of the patient are considered to be highly relevant, 
these are also included. The menopausal score is -1 for premenopausal, +1 for 
postmenopausal. A third class of patients were assigned a 0 value. These patients 
had had an hysterectomy, so no menopausal status could be appointed to them. 
It is beyond the scope of this paper to give a complete account of the meaning of 
the different features that are used or the way in which the data were acquired. 
We will limit ourselves to this short description and refer the reader to [2, 3] and 
gynecological textbooks for a more detailed explanation. 
3 Receiver Operating Characteristics 
3.1 Drawbacks to Mean Squared classification Error 
Let us assume that we use a one-hidden-layer feed-forward NN with m inputs x, 
nn hidden neurons with the tanh(.) as activation function, and one output , 
nh 
Y() - E wj tanh(E vijx +/3j), (1) 
j=l i----1 
parameterized by the vector 0 consisting of the network's weights wj and vii and 
bias terms j. The cost function is often chosen to be the squared difference between 
the desired d and the actual response y, averaged over all N samples [12], 
N 
- 2. (2) 
J(0) = 
k----1 
This type of cost function is continuous and differentiable, so it can be used in 
gradient based optimization techniques such as steepest descent (back-propagation), 
quasi-Newton or Levenberg-Marquardt methods [8, 9, 11, 12]. However there are 
some drawbacks to the use of this type of cost function. 
First of all, the MSE is heavily dependent on the relative proportion of 
the different output classes in the training set. In our dichotomic case this 
can easily be demonstrated by writing the cost function, with superscripts b and m 
respectively meaning benign and malignant, as 
Nb i N Nm 1 X -'N'*, {tlm 
= fb + Nb + + 
� � 
X (1 
If the relative proportion in the sample population is not representative for reality, 
the A parameter should be adjusted accordingly. In practice this real proportion is 
often not known accurately or one simply ignores the meaning of A and uses it as a 
design parameter in order to bias the accuracy towards one of the output classes. 
A second drawback of the MSE cost function is that it is not very in- 
formative towards practical usage of the classification tool. A clinician is 
not interested in the averaged deviation from desired numbers, but thinks in terms 
of percentages found, missed or misclassified. In the next section we will introduce 
the concepts of sensitivity and specificity to express these more practical measures.

3.2 Sensitivity, specificity and ROC-curves 
If we take the desired response to be 0 for benign and 1 for malignant cases, the 
way to make clearcut (dichotomic) decisions is to compare the numerical outcome 
of the neural network to a certain threshold value T between 0 and 1. When the 
outcome is above the threshold T, the prediction is said to be positive. Otherwise the 
prediction is said to be negative. With this convention, we say that the prediction 
was 
True Positive (TP) 
True Negative (TN) 
False Positive (FP) 
False Negative (FN) 
if the prediction was positive when the sample was malignant. 
if the prediction was negative when the sample was benign. 
if the prediction was positive when the sample was benign. 
if the prediction was negative when the sample was malignant. 
To every of the just defined terms TP, TN, FP and FN, a certain subregion of the 
total sample space can be associated, as depicted in Figure 1. In the same sense, 
we can associate to them a certain number counting the samples in each subregion.
