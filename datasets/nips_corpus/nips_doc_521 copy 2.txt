Abstract 
The dynamic behavior of a network model consisting of all-to-all excitatory 
coupled binary neurons with global inhibition is studied analytically and 
numerically. We prove that for random input signals, the output of the 
network consists of synchronized bursts with apparently random intermis- 
sions of noisy activity. Our results suggest that synchronous bursts can be 
generated by a simple neuronal architecture which amplifies incoming coin- 
cident signals. This synchronization process is accompanied by dampened 
oscillations which, by themselves, however, do not play any constructive 
role in this and can therefore be considered to be an epiphenomenon. 
I INTRODUCTION 
Recently synchronization phenomena in neural networks have attracted considerable 
attention. Gray e al. (1989, 1990) as well as Eckhorn e al. (1988) provided 
electrophysiological evidence that neurons in the visual cortex of cats discharge in a 
semi-synchronous, oscillatory manner in the 40 Hz range and that the firing activity 
of neurons up to 10 mm away is phase-locked with a mean phase-shift of less than 
3 msec. It has been proposed that this phase synchronization can solve the binding 
problem for figure-ground segregation (yon der Malsburg and Schneider, 1986) and 
underly visual attention and awareness (Crick and Koch, 1990). 
A number of theoretical explanations based on coupled (relaxation) oscillator mod-

els have been proposed for burst synchronization (Sompolinsky et ak, 1990). The 
crucial issue of phase synchronization has also recently been addressed by Bush and 
Douglas (1991), who simulated the dynamics of a network consisting ofbursty, layer 
V pyramidal cells coupled to a common pool of basket cells inhibiting all pyramidal 
cells.  Bush and Douglas found that excitatory interactions between the pyramidal 
cells increases the total neural activity as expected and that global inhibition leads 
to synchronized bursts with random intermissions. These population bursts appear 
to occur in a random manner in their model. The basic mechanism for the observed 
burst synchronization is hidden in the numerous anatomical and biophysical details 
of their model. These, and the related observation that to date no strong oscilla- 
tions have been recorded in the neuronal activity in visual cortex of awake monkeys, 
prompted us to investigate how phase synchronization can occur in the absence of 
frequency locking. 
2 A COINCIDENCE NETWORK 
We consider n excitatory coupled binary McCulloch-Pitts (1943) neurons whose 
output x i  [0, 1] at time t + 1 is given by: 
i = o' zi + i - 0 (1) 
i 
Here win > 1 is the normalized excitatory all-to-all synaptic coupling,  represents 
the external binary input and a[z] is the Heaviside step function, such that a[z] = 1 
for z > 0 and 0 elsewhere. Each neuron has the same dynamic threshold 0 > 0. 
Next we introduce the fraction m t of neurons which fire simultaneously at time t: 
_ t 
mt = I  xi (2) 
i 
In general, 0 < m t < 1; only if every neuron is active at time t do we have ra t -- 1. 
By summing eq. (1) we obtain the following equation of motion for our simple 
network. 
mr+, = 1 Z �'[wmt +  -- 01 (3) 
i 
The behavior of this (n+l)-state automata is fully described by the phase-state 
diagram of Figure 1. If 0 > 1 and 0/w > 1, the output of the network m t will 
vary with the input until at some time t', mt' = 0. Since the threshold 0 is always 
larger than the input, the network will remain in this state for all subsequent times. 
If 0 < 1 and O/w < 1, the network will drift until it comes to the state mt' = 1. 
Since subsequent wm t is at all times larger than the threshold, the network remains 
latched at m t = 1. If 0 > 1, but 0/w < 1, the network can latch in either the 
m t = 0 or the m t = 1 state and will remain there indefinitely. Lastly, if 0 < 1, but 
0/w > 1, the threshold is by itself not large enough to keep the network latched 
 This model bears similarities to Wilson and Bower's (1992) model describing the origin 
of phase-locking in olfactory cortex.

Therefore, we are operating in the topmost left part of Fig. 1 but preventing the 
network from latching to m t = 1 by resetting it. Such a dynamic threshold bears 
some similarities to the models of Horn and Usher (1990) and others, but is much 
simpler. Note that 0(m t) exactly mimics the effect of a common inhibitory neuron 
which is only excited if all neurons fire simultaneously. 
Our network now acts as a coincidence detector, such that all neurons will fire 
at time t + 2, i.e., rn] +2 = 1 if at least k neurons receive at time t a 1 as input. 
k is the smallest integer with k > 0 � n/co. The threshold 0(m t) is then transiently 
increased and the network is reset and the game begins anew. In other words, the 
Let us introduce an adaptive time-dependent threshold, 0 t. We assume that 0 t 
remains at its value 0 < 1 as long as the total activity remains less than 1. If, 
however, m t = 1, we increase 0 t to a value larger than co + 1. This has the effect of 
resetting the activity of the entire network to 0 in the next time step, i.e., m + = 
(l/n) Y-i r(co + i - (co + 1 + e)) = 0. The threshold will then automatically reset 
itself to its old value:

and O/or = 0.225. The input variables  are independently distributed according to 
P() = pS(I - 1) + (1 - p)5() with p = 0.1. If more than five input signals with 
 = 1 coincide, the entire population will fire in synchrony two time steps later, 
i.e. rn t+2 = 1. Note the random appearance of the interburst intervals. 
network detects coincidences and signals this by a synchronized burst of neuronal 
activity followed by a brief respite of activity (Figure 2). 
The time dependence of m t given by eq. (5) can be written as: 
s t for0<m t< & 
rn + = 1 for 0_ < rn  < 1 (6) 
0 for rn  = 1 
By introducing functions A(m), B(m), C(m) which take on the value 1 in the 
intervals specified for m = rn t in eq. (6), respectively, and zero elsewhere, rn + can 
be written as: 
rn '+ = stA(rnt) + 1. B(m') + O . C(rn') (7) 
This equation can be iterated, yielding an explicit expression for rn t as a function 
of the external inputs st+l,... s o and the initial value m�:

Eq. (8) shows that the dynamics of the network can be solved explicitly, by itera- 
tively applying M, t - I number of times to the initial network configuration.

DISTRIBUTION OF BURSTS AND TIME 
CORRELATIONS 
The synchronous activity at time t depends on the specific realization of the input 
signals at different times (eq. 8). In order to get rid of this ambiguity we resort to 
averaged quantities where averages are understood over the distribution tS{s t} of 
1 r t 
inputs s t =  Y]-i=x i' A very useful averaged quantity is the probability pt(m), 
describing the fraction m of simultaneously firing neurons at time t. pt(m) is related 
to the probability distribution P{s t } via: 
= s0}]) (9) 
where (...) denotes the average with respect to/5{st} and mr{st-X,... s �} is given 
by eq. (8). If the input signals  are uncorrelated in time, rn t+ depends according 
to eq. (7) only on rn t, and the time evolution of Pt(m) can be described by the 
Chapman-Kolmogorov equation. We then find: 
Pt(m) = Poo(m) + [P�(m) - Poo(m)]. f(t) (10) 
where 
1 
Poo(m) -- 1 q- 2r/[/5(m) q- r/8(m - 1) q- r/8(m)] (11) 
is the limiting distribution which evolves from the initial distribution P�(m) for large 
times, because the factor f(t) = r/� cos(gt), where 
decays exponentially with time and rl = fo  tS(s)B(s)ds = foi/, tS(s)ds. Notice that 
0 _< r/_< 1 holds (for more details, see Koch and Schuster, 1992). 
The limiting equilibrium distribution Poo(m) evolves from the initial distribution 
P�(m) in an oscillatory fashion, with the building up of two delta-functions at m = 1 
and m = 0 at the expense of P�(m). This signals the emergence of synchronous 
bursts, i.e., rn t = 1, which are always followed at the next time-step by zero activity, 
i.e., m t+ = 0 (see also Fig. 2). The equilibrium value for the mean fraction of 
synchronized neurons is

It is interesting to ask what type of time correlations will develop in the output 
of our network if it is stimulated with uncorrelated noise, . The autocovariance 
function is
