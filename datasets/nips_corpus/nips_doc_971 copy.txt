Abstract 
This paper studies the problem of diffusion in Markovian models, 
such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) and how it makes very 
difficult the task of learning of long-term dependencies in sequences. 
Using results from Markov chain theory, we show that the problem 
of diffusion is reduced if the transition probabilities approach 0 or 1. 
Under this condition, standard HMMs have very limited modeling 
capabilities, but input/output HMMs can still perform interesting 
computations. 
1 Introduction 
This paper presents an important new element in our research on the problem of 
learning long-term dependencies in sequences. In our previous work [4] we found 
theoretical reasons for the difficulty in training recurrent networks (or more gen- 
erally parametric non-linear dynamical systems) to learn long-term dependencies. 
The main result stated that either long-term storing or gradient propagation would 
be harmed, depending on whether the norm of the JacobJan of the state to state 
function was greater or less than 1. In this paper we consider a special case in which 
the norm of the JacobJan of the state to state function is constrained to be exactly 
i because this matrix is a stochastic matrix. 
We consider both homogeneous and non-homogeneous Markovian models. Let n 
be the number of states and At be the transition matrices (constant in the ho- 
mogeneous case): Aij(ut) - P(qt = J lqt- - i, ut;O) where ut is an external 
input (constant in the homogeneous case) and O is a vector of parameters. In 
the homogeneous case (e.g., standard HMMs), such models can learn the distribu- 
tion of output sequences by associating an output distribution to each state. In

the non-homogeneous case, transition and output distributions are conditional on 
the input sequences, allowing to model relationships between input and output se- 
quences (e.g. to do sequence egression or classification as with recurrent networks). 
We thus called Input/Output HMM (IOHMM) this kind of non-homogeneous 
HMM. In [3, 2] we proposed a connectionist implementation of IOHMMs. In both 
cases, training requires propagating forward probabilities and backward probabili- 
ties, taking products with the transition probability matrix or its transpose. This 
paper studies in which conditions these products of matrices might gradually 
converge to lower rank, thus harming storage and learning of long-term context. 
However, we find in this paper that IOHMMs can better deal with this problem 
than homogeneous HMMs. 
2 Mathematical Preliminaries 
2.1 Definitions 
A matrix A is said to be non-negative, written A _> 0, if Aij _> 0 Vi, j. Positive 
matrices are defined similarly. A non-negative square matrix A E R nxn is called 
row stochastic (or simply stochastic in this paper) if Ej=i Aij = 1 �i = 1...n. 
A no.n-negative matrix is said to be row [column] allowable if every row [column] 
sum is positive. An allowable matrix is both row and column allowable. A non- 
negative matrix can be associated to the directed transition graph G that constrains 
the Markov chain. An incidence matrix  corresponding to a given non-negative 
matrix A replaces all positive entries of A by 1. The incidence matrix of A is a 
connectivity matrix corresponding to the graph G (assumed to be connected here). 
Some algebraic properties of A are described in terms of the topology of G. 
Definition 1 (Irreducible Matrix) A non-negative n x n matrix A is said to be 
irreducible if for every pair i, j of indices, J m = re(i, j) positive integer s.t. 
(A')ij > O. 
A matrix A is irreducible if and only if the associated graph is strongly connected 
(i.e., there exists a path between any pair of states i,j). If 3k s.t. (Ak)ii > 0, d(i) 
is called the period of index i if it is the greatest common divisor (g.c.d.) of those k 
for which (A')a > 0. In an irreducible matrix all the indices have the same period 
d, which is called the period of the matrix. The period of a matrix is the g.c.d. of 
the lengths of all cycles in the associated transition graph. 
Definition 2 (Primitive matrix) A non-negative matrix A is said to be primitive 
if there exists a positive integer k s.t. A  > O. 
An irreducible matrix is either periodic or primitive (i.e. of period 1). A primitive 
stochastic matrix is necessarily allowable. 
2.2 The Perron-Frobenius Theorem 
Theorem I (See [6], Theorem 1.1.) Suppose A is an n x n non-negative prim- 
itive matrisc. Then there exists an eigenvalue r such that: 
1. r is real and positive; 
2. with r can be associated strictly positive left and right eigenvectors; 
s. r > for any eigenvalue   r; 
d. the eigenvectors associated with r are unique to constant multiples. 
5. If 0 < B < A and/3 is an eigenvalue of B, then 1/31-< r. Moreover, 1/31 = r 
implies B = A.

6. r is simple root of the characteristic equation of A. 
A simple consequence of the theorem for stochastic matrices is the following: 
Corollary I Suppose A is a primitive stochastic matrix. Then its largest eige'h- 
value is 1 and there is only one corresponding right eigenvector, which is x = 
[1, 1... 1]'. Furthermore, all other eigenvalues < 1. 
Proof. Ax = x by definition of stochastic matrices. This eigenvector is unique 
and all other eigenvalues < 1 by the Perron-Frobenius Theorem. 
If A is stochastic but periodic with period d, then A has d eigenvalues of module 1 
which are the d complex roots of 1. 
3 Learning Long-Term Dependencies with HMMs 
In this section we analyze the case of a primitive transition matrix as well as the 
general case with a canonical re-ordering of the matrix indices. We discuss how 
ergodicity coefficients can be used to measure the difficulty in learning long-term 
dependencies. Finally, we find that in order to avoid all diffusion, the transitions 
should be deterministic (0 or 1 probability). 
3.1 Training Standard HMMs 
Theorem 2 (See [6], Theorem 4.2.) If A is a primitive stochastic matrix, then 
as t -- cx, A t -- xv' where v' is the unique stationary distribution of the Markov 
chain. The rate of approach is geometric. 
Thus if A is primitive, then limt_+ A t converges to a matrix whose eigenvalues are 
all 0 except for A = i (with eigenvector x), i.e. the rank of this product converges 
to 1, i.e. its rows are equal. A consequence of theorem 2 is that it is very difficult to 
train ordinary hidden Markov models, with a primitive transition matrix, to model 
long-term dependencies in observed sequences. The reason is that the distribution 
over the states at time t > to becomes gradually independent of the distribution over 
the states at time to as t increases. It means that states at time to become equally 
responsible for increasing the likelihood of an output at time t. This corresponds in 
the backward phase of the EM algorithm for training HMMs to a diffusion of credit 
over all the states. In practice we train HMMs with finite sequences. However, 
training will become more and more numerically ill-conditioned as one considers 
longer term dependencies. Consider two events e0 (occurring at to) and et (occur- 
ring at t), and suppose there are also interesting events occurring in between. Let 
us consider the overall influence of states at times r < t upon the likelihood of the 
outputs at time t. Because of the phenomenon of diffusion of credit, and because 
gradients are added together, the influence of intervening events (especially those 
occurring shortly before t) will be much stronger than the influence of e0. Fur- 
thermore, this problem gets geometrically worse as t increases. Clearly a positive 
matrix is primitive. Thus in order to learn long-term dependencies, we would like 
to have many zeros in the matrix of transition probabilities. Unfortunately, this 
generally supposes prior knowledge of an appropriate connectivity graph. 
3.2 Coefficients of ergodicity 
To study products of non-negative matrices and the loss of information about initial 
state in Markov chains (particularly in the non-homogeneous case), we introduce 
the projective distance between vectors x and y: 
d(x',y'): m..x ln(xX/yj ). 
,3 jYi 
Clearly, some contraction takes place when d(x'A, y'A) _< d(x', y').

Definition 3 Birkhoff's contraction coefficient rs(A), for a non-negative column- 
allowable matrix A, is defined in terms of the projectwe distance: 
d(x'A, 
rB(A) = sup 
x,y>O;xAy d(x', 
Dobrushin's coefficient rx(A), for a stochastic matrix A, is defined as follows:

'r(A): s.up E lai, - 
'$ k 
Both are proper ergodicity coefficients: 0 _ r(A) _ i and r(A) = 0 if and only if A 
has identical rows. Furthermore, v(AxA2) _ v(Ax)v(A2)(see [6]). 
3.3 Products of Stochastic Matrices 
Let AO,t) - AxA2.. 'At-At denote a forward product of stochastic matrices 
Ax,A2,...At. From the properties of ,'B and rx, if r(At) < 1,t > 0 then 
limt_. T(A �) -- i0i i.e. A � has rank i and identical rows. Weak ergodic- 
ity is then defined ' terms of a proper ergodic coefficient r such as ,' and rx: 
Definition 4 (Weak Ergodicity) The products of stochastic matrices A(p,r) are 
weakly ergodic if and only if for all to _ 0 as t -- 0% r(A(t�,t)) -- O. 
Theorem 3 (See [6], Lemma 3.3 and 3.4.) Let A � a forward product of 
non-negative and allowable matrices, then the products A(1,t) are weakly ergodic 
if and only if the following conditions both hold: 
1. Bto s.t. A (t�,t)  0 Vt _> to
