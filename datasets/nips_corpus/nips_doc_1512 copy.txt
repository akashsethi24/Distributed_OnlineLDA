Abstract 
Information from the senses must be compressed into the limited range 
of firing rates generated by spiking nerve cells. Optimal compression 
uses all firing rates equally often, implying that the nerve cell's response 
matches the statistics of naturally occurring stimuli. Since changing 
the voltage-dependent ionic conductances in the cell membrane alters 
the flow of information, an unsupervised, non-Hebbian, developmental 
learning rule is derived to adapt the conductances in Hodgkin-Huxley 
model neurons. By maximizing the rate of information transmission, 
each firing rate within the model neuron's limited dynamic range is used 
equally often. 
An efficient neuronal representation of incoming sensory information should take advan- 
tage of the regularity and scale invariance of stimulus features in the natural world. In 
the case of vision, this regularity is reflected in the typical probabilities of encountering 
particular visual contrasts, spatial orientations, or colors Ill. Given these probabilities, an 
optimized neural code would eliminate any redundancy, while devoting increased repre- 
sentation to commonly encountered features. 
At the level of a single spiking neuron, information about a potentially large range of stimuli 
is compressed into a finite range of firing rates, since the maximum firing rate of a neuron is 
limited. Optimizing the information transmission through a single neuron in the presence 
of uniform, additive noise has an intuitive interpretation: the most efficient representation 
of the input uses every firing rate with equal probability. An analogous principle for non- 
spiking neurons has been tested experimentally by Laughlin [2], who matched the statistics

From a theoretical perspective, the central question is whether a neuron can learn the 
best representation for natural stimuli through experience. During neuronal development, 
the nature and frequency of incoming stimuli are known to change both the anatomical 
structure of neurons and the distribution of ionic conductances throughout the cell [3]. We 
seek a guiding principle that governs the developmental timecourse of the Na +, Ca 2+ and 
K + conductances in the somatic and dendritic membrane by asking how a neuron would 
set its conductances to transmit as much information as possible. Spiking neurons must 
associate a range of different inputs to a set of distinct responses--a more difficult task than

keeping the firing rate or excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) amplitude constant under 
changing conditions, two tasks for which learning rules that change the voltage-dependent 
conductances have recently been proposed [4, 5]. Learning the proper representation of 
stimulus information goes beyond simply correlating input and output; an alternative to the 
classic postulate of Hebb [6], in which synaptic learning in networks is a consequence of 
correlated activity between pre- and postsynaptic neurons, is required for such learning in 
a single neuron. 
To explore the feasibility of learning rules for information maximization, a simplified 
model of a neuron consisting of two electrotonic compartments, illustrated in fig. 1, was 
constructed. The soma (or cell body) contains the classic Hodgkin-Huxley sodium and 
delayed rectifier potassium conductances, with the addition of a transient potassium A- 
current and an effective calcium-dependent potassium current. The soma is coupled 
through an effective conductance G to the dendritic compartment, which contains the 
synaptic input conductance and three adjustable calcium and three adjustable potassium 
conductances. 
The dynamics of this model are given by Hodgkin-Huxley-like equations that govern the 
membrane potential and a set of activation and inactivation variables, mi and hi, respec- 
tively. In each compartment of the neuron, the voltage V evolves as 
C dV . q 
at = YgilTt hi (Ei- V), (1)

where U is the membrane capacitance, gi is the (peak) value of the i-th conductance, pi and 
qi are integers, and Ei are the ion-specific reversal potentials. The variables hi and mi obey 
first order kinetics of the type din/dr: (mo (V) - m)/r(V), where mo (V) denotes the 
steady state activation when the voltage is clamped to 17 and r(V) is a voltage-dependent 
time constant. 
All parameters for the somatic compartment, with the exception of the adaptation con- 
ductance, are given by the standard model of Connor et al (1977) [7]. This choice of 
somatic spiking conductances allows spiking to occur at arbitrarily low firing rates. Adap- 
tation is modeled by a calcium-dependent potassium conductance that scales with the fir- 
ing rate, such that the conductance has a mean value of 34 mS/cm 2 Hz. The calcium 
and potassium conductances in the dendritic compartment have simple activation and in- 
activation functions described by distinct Boltzmann functions. Together with the peak 
conductance values, the midpoint voltages V_ and slopes s of these Boltzmann functions

adapt to the statistics of stimuli. For simplicity, all time constants for the dendritic con- 
ductances are set to a constant 5 msec. For additional details and parameter values, see

Hodgkin-Huxley models can exhibit complex behaviors on several timescales, such as fir- 
ing patterns consisting of bursts--sequences of multiple spikes interspersed with periods 
of silence. We will, however, focus on models of regularly spiking cells that adapt to 
a sustained stimulus by spiking periodically. To quantify how much information about a 
continuous stimulus variable x the time-averaged firing rate f of a regularly spiking neuron 
carries, we use a lower bound [8] on the mutual information I(f; x) between the stimulus

Iil(f;a:)=-/ln(p(f)af(a:))p(c)da:-ln(), (2) 
where p(f) is the probability, given the set of all stimuli, of a firing rate f, and a] (:) is the 
variance of the firing rate in response to a given stimulus 
To maximize the information transfer, does a neuron need to know the arrival rates of 
photons impinging on the retina or the frequencies of sound waves hitting the ear's tym- 
panic membrane? Since the ion channels in the dendrites only sense a voltage and not the 
stimulus directly, the answer to this question, fortunately, is no: maximizing the informa- 
tion between the firing rate f and the dendritic voltage Vdcnd(t) is equivalent to maximizing 
the information about the stimuli, as long as we can guarantee that the transformation from 
stimuli to firing rates is always one-to-one. 
Since a neuron must be able to adapt to a changing environment and shifting intra- and 
extracellular conditions [4], learning and relearning of the proper conductance parameters, 
such as the channel densities, should occur on a continual basis. An alphabet zoo of dif- 
ferent calcium (Ca 2+) conductances in neurons of the central nervous system, denoted 'L', 
'N', 'P', 'R', and 'T'-conductances, reflects a wealth of different voltage and pharmacolog- 
ical properties [9], matching an equal diversity of potassium (K +) channels. No fewer than 
ten different genes code for various Ca 2+ subunits, allowing for a combinatorial number 
of functionally different channels [ 10]. A self-regulating neuron should be able to express 
different ionic channels and insert them into the membrane. In information maximization, 
the parameters for each of the conductances, such as the number of channels, are continu- 
ally modified in the direction that most increases the mutual information I[f; Vdcnd (t)] each 
time a stimulus occurs. 
The standard approach to such a problem is known as stochastic approximation of the 
mutual information, which was recently applied to feedforward neural networks for blind 
source sound separation by Bell and Sejnowski [11]. We define a free energy f' = 
E(f) - --llLB(f; X), where E(f) incorporates constraints on the peak or mean firing 
rate f, and 3 is a Lagrangean parameter that balances the mutual information and con- 
straint satisfaction. Stochastic approximation then consists of adjusting the parameter r of 
a voltage-dependent conductance by 
O 6Y(x) (3) 
Arlx = -riot *p(x) 
whenever a stimulus x is presented; this will, by definition, occur with probability p(x). 
In the model, the stimuli are taken to be maintained synaptic input conductances 9syn last- 
ing 200 msec and drawn randomly from a fixed, continuous probability distribution. Af- 
ter an initial transient, we assume that the voltage waveform Vdend(t) settles into a sim- 
ple periodic limit cycle as dictated by the somatic spiking conductances. We thus posit 
the existence of the invertible composition of maps, such that the input conductance 9syn 
maps onto a periodic voltage waveform Vdend(t) of period T, from thence onto an aver- 
aged current (I) = 1IT fo r I(t) dt to the soma, and then finally onto an output firing rate 
f. The last element in this chain of transforma
