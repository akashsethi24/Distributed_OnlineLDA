We present a simplified model of the micromechanics of the human 
cochlea, realized with electrical elements. Simulation of the model 
shows that it retains four signal processing features whose importance 
we argue on the basis of engineering logic and evolutionary evidence. 
Furthermore, just as the cochlea does, the model achieves massively 
parallel signal processing in a stmcturally economic way, by means of 
shared elements. By extracting what we believe are the five essential 
features of the cochlea, we hope to design a useful front-end filter to 
process acoustic images and to obtain a better understanding of the 
auditory system. 
INTRODUCTION 
Results of psychoacoustical and physiological experiments in humans indicate that 
the auditory system creates acoustic images via massively parallel neural computations. 
These computations enable the brain to perform voice detection, sound localization, and 
many other complex taskS. For example, by recording a random signal with a wide range 
of frequency components, and playing this signal simultaneously through both channels 
of a stereo headset, one causes the brain to create an acoustical image of a shsh sound in 
the center of the head. Delaying the presentation of just one frequency component in the 
random signal going to one ear and simultaneously playing the original signal to the 
other ear, one would still have the image of a shsh in the center of the head; however if 
one mentally searches the acoustical image space carefully, a clear tone can be found far 
off to one side of the head. The frequency of this tone will be that of the component with 
the time delay to one ear. Both ears still are receiving wide-band random signals. The 
isolated tone will not be perceptible from the signal to either ear alone; but with both 
signals together, the brain has enough data to isolate the delayed tone in an acoustical 
image. The brain achieves this by massively parallel neural computation. 
Because the acoustic front-end filter for the brain is the cochlea, people have proposed 
that analogs of the cochlea might serve well as front-end filters for man-made processors 
of acoustical images (Lyon, Mead, 1988). If we were to base a cochlear analog on 
current biophysical models of this structure, it would be extraordinarily complicated and 
extremely difficult to realize with hardware. Because of this, we want to start with a 
cochlear model that incorporates a minimum set of essential ingredients. The ears of 
lower vertebrates, such as alligators and frogs, provide some clues to help identify those 
ingredients. These animals presumably have to compute acoustic images similar to ours,

but they do not have cochleas. The acoustic front-end filters in the ears of these animals 
evolved independently and in parallel to the evolution of the cochlea. Nevertheless, those 
front-end filters share four functional properties with the part of the cochlea which 
responds to the lower 7 out of 10 octaves of hearing (20 Hz. to 2560 Hz.):

They are multichannel filters with each channel 
covering a different part of the frequency spectrum. 
Each channel is a relatively broad-band frequency 
filter. 
Each filter has an extremely steep high-frequency 
band edge (typically 60 to 200 db/oct). 
Each filter has nearly linear phase shift as a function 
of frequency, within its passband. 
The front-end acoustical filters of lower vertebrates also have at least one structural feature 
in common with the cochlea: namely, the various filter channels share their dynamic 
components. This is the fifth property we choose to include. Properties 1 and 3 provide 
good resolution in frequency; properties 2 and 4 are what filter designers would add to 
provide good resolution in time. 
In order to compute acoustical images with the neural networks in our brain, we need 
both kinds of resolution: time and frequency. Shared elements, a structural feature, has 
obvious advantages for economy of construction. The fact that evolution has come to 
these same front-end filter properties repeatedly suggests that these properties have 
compelling advantages with respect to an animal's survival. We submit that we can 
realize all of these properties very well with the simplest of the modem cochlear models, 
namely that of Joseph Zwislocki (1965). This is a transmission line model made 
entirely of passive elements.

A COCHLEAR MODEL 
In order to illustrate Zwislocki's model, a quick review of the mechanics of the 
cochlea is useful. Figure 1 depicts the ear with the cochlea represented by an electrical 
analog. A sound pressure wave enters the outer ear and strikes the ear drum which, in 
turn, causes the three bones of the middle ear to vibrate. The last bone, known as the 
stapes, is connected to the oval window (represented in figure 1 by the voltage source at 
the beginning of the electrical analog), where the acoustic energy enters the cochlea. 
As the acoustic energy is transferred to the oval window, a fluid-mechanical wave is 
formed along a structure known as the basilar membrane (This membrane and the 
surrounding fluid is represented by the series and shunt circuit elements of figure 1). As 
the basilar membrane vibrates, the acoustical signal is transduced to neural impulses 
which travel along the auditory nerve, carrying the data used by the nervous system to 
compute auditory images. Figure 2 is taken from a paper by Zweig et al. (1976), and 
depicts an uncoiled cochlea. As the fluid-mechanical wave travels through the cochlea: 1) 
The wave gradually slows down, and 2) The higher-frequency components of the wave are 
absorbed, leaving an increasingly narrower band of low-frequency components proceeding 
on toward the far end of the cochlea. If we were to uncoil and enlarge the basilar 
membrane it would look like a swim fin (figure 3). If we now were to push on the 
basilar membrane, it would push back like a spring. It is most compliant at the wide, 
thin end of the fin. Thus as one moves along the basilar membrane from its basal to 
apical end, its compliance increases. Zwislocki's wansmission-line model was tapered in 
this same way.

Zwislocki's model of the cochlea is a distributed parameter transmission line. 
Figure 4 shows a lumped electrical analog of the model. The series elements (L1,...Ln) 
represent the local inertia of the cochlear fluid. The shunt capacitive elements (C 1,...Cn) 
represent the local compliance of the basilar membrane. The shunt resistive elements 
(R 1,...Rn) represent the local viscous resistance of the basilar membrane and associated 
fluid. The model has one input and a huge number of outputs. The input, sound 
pressure at the oval window, is represented here as a voltage source. The outputs are 
either the displacements or the velocities of the various regions of the basilar membrane.

Transmission line model of the cochlea represented as an 
electrical circuit. 
In the electrical analog, shown in figure 4, we have selected velocities as the outputs (in 
order to compare our data to real neural tuning curves) and we have represented those 
velocities as the currents (I1,...In). The original analysis of Zwislocki's tapered 
transmission line model did not produce the steep high frequency band edges that are 
observed in real cochleas. This deficiency was a major driving force behind the early 
development of more complex cochlear models. Recently, it was found that the original 
analysis placed the Zwislocki model in an inappropriate mode of operation (Lewis, 1984). 
In this mode,determined by the relative parameter values, the high frequency band edges 
had very gentle slopes. Solving the partial differential equations for the model with the 
help of a commonly used simplification (the WKB approximation), one finds a second 
mode of operation. In this mode, the model produces all five of the properties that we 
desire, including extraordinarily steep high-frequency band edges.

RESULTS 
We were curious to know whether or not the newly-found mode of operation, with 
its very steep high-frequency band edges, could be found in a finite-element version of the 
model. If so, we should be able to realize a lumped, analog version of the Zwislocki 
model for use as a practical front-end filter for acoustical image formation and processing. 
We decided to implement the finite element model in SPICE. SPICE is a software 
package that is used for electrical circuit simulation. Our SPICE model showed the 
following: As long as the model was made up of enough segments, and as long as the 
elements had appropriate parameter values, the second mode of operation indeed was 
available. Furthermore, it was the predominant mode of operation when the parmeter 
values of the model were matched to biophysical data for the cochlea.
