Abstract 
We present a general formulation for a network of stochastic di- 
rectional units. This formulation is an extension of the Boltzmann 
machine in which the units are not binary, but take on values in a 
cyclic range, between 0 and 27r radians. The state of each unit in 
a Directional-Unit Boltzmann Machine (DUBM) is described by a 
complex variable, where the phase component specifies a direction; 
the weights are also complex variables. We associate a quadratic 
energy function, and corresponding probability, with each DUBM 
configuration. The conditional distribution of a unit's stochastic 
state is a circular version of the Gaussian probability distribution, 
known as the von Mises distribution. In a mean-field approxima- 
tion to a stochastic DUBM, the phase component of a unit's state 
represents its mean direction, and the magnitude component spec- 
ifies the degree of certainty associated with this direction. This 
combination of a value and a certainty provides additional repre- 
sentational power in a unit. We describe a learning algorithm and 
simulations that demonstrate a mean-field DUBM'S ability to learn 
interesting mappings. 
Many kinds of information can naturally be represented in terms of angular, or 
directional, variables. A circular range forms a suitable representation for explicitly 
directional information, such as wind direction, as well as for information where 
the underlying range is periodic, such as days of the week or months of the year. 
In computer vision, tangent fields and optic flow fields are represented as fields of 
oriented line segments, each of which can be described by a magnitude and direction. 
Directions can also be used to represent a set of symbolic labels, e.g., object label 
A at 0, and object label B at 7r/2 radians. We discuss below some advantages of 
representing symbolic labels with directional units.

These and many other phenomena can be usefully encoded using a directional 
representation--a polar coordinate representation of complex values in which the 
phase parameter indicates a direction between 0 and 27r radians. We have devised a 
general formulation of networks of stochastic directional units. This paper describes 
a directional-unit Boltzmann machine (DUBM), which is a novel generalization of a 
Boltzmann machine (Ackley, Hinton and Sejnowski, 1985) in which the units are 
not binary, but instead take on directional values between 0 and 27r. 
1 STOCHASTIC DUBM 
A stochastic directional unit takes on values on the unit circle. We associate with 
unit j a random variable Zj; a particular state of j is described by a complex 
number with magnitude one and direction, or phase rj: zj = e irj 
The weights of a DUBM also take on complex values. The weight from unit k to 
unit j is: wjk -- bjke%k. We constrain the weight matrix W to be Hermitian' 
W T = W*, where the diagonal elements of the matrix are zero, and the asterisk 
indicates the complex conjugate operation. Note that if the components are real, 
then W T = W, which is a real symmetric matrix. Thus, the Hermitian form is a 
natural generalization of weight symmetry to the complex domain. 
This definition of W leads to a Hermitian quadratic form that generalizes the real 
quadratic form of the Hopfield energy function: 
E(z) -1/2 z*:rWz = 1/2 y *w 
= - zj% j (1) 
j,k 
where z is the vector of the units' complex states in a particular global configuration. 
Noest (1988) independently proposed this energy function. It is similar to that 
used in Fradkin, Huberman, and Shenker's (1978) generalization of the XY model 
of statistical mechanics to allow arbitary weight phases Oj, and coupled oscillator 
models, e.g., Baldi and Meir (1990). 
We can define a probability distribution over the possible states of a stochastic 
network using the Boltzmann factor. In a DUBM, we can describe the energy as a 
function of the state of a particular unit j: 
*W ' 
E(Zj = zj) = -1/2 [yzizwj + y zkzj 1 
k k 
We define 
Xj -- Z * ' 
kWjk -- aje*Ctj 
k 
to be the net input to unit j, where aj and oj denote the magnitude and phase of 
x j, respectively. 
Applying the Boltzmann factor, we find that the probability that unit j is in a 
particular state is proportional to: 
p(Zj = e = d 
where  is the reciprocal of the system temperature.

Figure 1' A circular normal density function laid over a unit circle. The dots 
along the circle represent samples of the circular normal random variable Z 5. The 
expected direction of ZS, , is 7r/4; r 5 is its resultant length. 
This probability distribution for a unit's state corresponds to a distribution known 
as the yon Mises, or circular normal, distribution (Mardia, 1972). Two parameters 
completely characterize this distribution: a mean direction Y = (0, 27r] and a con- 
centration parameter m > 0 that behaves like the reciprocal of the variance of a 
Gaussian distribution on a linear random variable. The probability density function 
of a circular normal random variable Z is1: 
p(r; Y, m) = 1 e,COS(-) 
27rI0(m) (3) 
From Equations 2 and 3, we see that if a unit adopts states according to its contribu- 
tion to the system energy, it will be a circular normal variable with mean direction 
aj and concentration parameter mj : /aj. These parameters are directly deter- 
mined by the net input to the unit. 
Figure 1 shows a circular normal density function for ZS, the state of unit j. This 
figure also shows the expected value of its stochastic state, which we define as: 
Y5 = < Z5 > = r5 ei/j (4) 
where 75, the phase of YS, is the mean direction and rs, the magnitude of yj, is the 
resultant length. For a circular normal random variable, 75 = J-J, and rj -- Io(mj)' 
When samples of Z 5 are concentrated on a small arc about the mean (see Figure 1), 
rj will approach length one. This corresponds to a large concentration parameter 
(rn 5 - /as). Conversely, for small ms, the distribution approaches the uniform 
distribution on the circle, and the resultant length falls toward zero. For a uniform 
distribution, r 5 = 0. Note that the concentration parameter for a unit's circular

normal density function is proportional to/, the reciprocal of the system tempera- 
ture. Higher temperatures will thus have the effect of making this distribution more 
uniform, just as they do in a binary-unit Boltzmann machine. 
2 EMERGENT PROPERTIES OF A DUBM 
A network of directional units as defined above contains two important emergent 
properties. The first property is that the magnitude of the net input to unit j 
describes the extent to which its various inputs agree. Intuitively, one can think 
of each component zkw]k of the sum that comprises xj as predicting a phase for 
unit j. When the phases of these components are equal, the magnitude of xj, aj, is 
maximized. If these phase predictions are far apart, then they will act to cancel each 
other out, and produce a small aj. Given xj, we can compute the expected value 
of the output of unit j. The expected direction of the unit roughly represents the 
weighted average of the phase predictions, while the resultant length is a monotonic 
function of a I and hence describes the agreement between the various predictions. 
The key idea here is that the resultant length directly describes the degree of cer- 
tainty in the expected direction of unit j. Thus, a DUBM naturally incorporates a 
representation of the system's confidence in a value. This ability to combine several 
sources of evidence, and not only represent a value but also describe the certainty 
of that value is an important property that may be useful in a variety of domains. 
The second emergent property is that the DUBM energy is globally rotation- 
invariant--E is unaffected when the same rotation is applied to all units' states 
in the network. For each DUBM configuration, there is an equivalence class of con- 
figurations which have the same energy. In a similar way, we find that the magnitude 
of xj is rotation-invariant. That is, when we translate the phases of all units but 
one by some phase, the magnitude of that unit is unaffected. This property under- 
lies one of the key advantages of the representation: both the magnitude of a unit's 
state as well as system energy depend on the relative rather than absolute phases 
of the units. 
3 DETERMINISTIC DUBM 
Just as in deterministic binary-unit Boltzmann machines (Peterson and Anderson, 
1987; Hinton, 1989), we can greatly reduce the computational time required to 
run a large stochastic system if we invoke the mean-field approximation, which 
states that once the system has reached equilibrium, the stochastic variables can be 
approximated by their mean values. In this approximation, the variables are treated 
as independent, and the system probability distribution is simply the product of 
the probability distributions for the individual units. 
Gisln, Peterson, and Sbderberg (1992) originally proposed a mean-field theory for 
networks of directional (or rotor) units, but only considered the case of real- 
valued weights. They derived the mean-field consistency equations by using the 
saddle-poin
