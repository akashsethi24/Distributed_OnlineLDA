ABSTRACT 
An increasing number of pr(foundly deaf patients suffering from sen- 
sorineural deafness are using cooblear implants as prostheses. After the 
implant, sound can be detected through the electrical stimulation of the 
remaining peripheral auditory nervous system. Although great progress has 
been achieved in this area, no useful speech recognition has been attained 
with either single or multiple channel cooblear implants. 
Coding evidence suggests that it is necessary for any implant which 
would effectively couple with the natural speech perception system to simu- 
late the temporal dispersion and other phenomena found in the natural 
receptors, and currently not implemented in any cooblear implants. To this 
end, it is presented here a computational model using artificial neural net- 
works (ANN) to incorporate the natural phenomena in the artificial 
cochlear. 
The ANN model presents a series of advantages to the implementation 
of such systems. First, the hardware requirements, with constraints on 
power, size, and processing speeds, can be taken into account together with 
the development of the underlining software, before the actual neural struc- 
tures are totally defined. Second, the ANN model, since it is an abstraction 
of natural neurons, carries the necessary ingredients and is a close mapping 
for implementing the necessary functions. Third, some of the processing, 
like sorting and majority functions, could be implemented more efficiently, 
requiring only local decisions. Fourth, the ANN model allows function 
modifications through parametric modification (no software recoding), which 
permits a variety of fine-tuning experiments, with the opinion of the 
patients, to be conceived. Some of those will permit the user some freedom 
in system modification at real-time, allowing finer and more subjective 
adjustments to fit differences on the condition and operation of individual's 
remaining peripheral auditory system. 
1. INTRODUCTION 
The study of the model of sensory receptors can be carried out either 
via trying to understand how the natural receptors process incoming signMs 
and build a representation code, or via the construction of artificial replace- 
ments. In the second case, we are interested in to what extent those 
artificial counterparts have the ability to replace the natural receptors. 
Several groups are now carrying out the design of artificial sensors. 
Artificial cochleas seem to have a number of different designs and a tradition 
of experiments. These make them now available for widespread use as 
prostheses for patients who have sensorineura] deafness caused by hair 
damage.

Although surgery is required for such implants, their performance has 
reached a level of maturity to induce patients to seek out these devices 
voluntarily. Unfortunately, only partial acoustic information is obtained by 
severely deaf patients with cochlear prosthesis. Useful patterns for speech 
communication are not yet 'fully recognizable through auditory prostheses. 
This problem with artificial receptors is true for both single implants, that 
stimulate large sections of the cochlea with signals that cover a large portion 
of the spectrum [4,5], and multi channel implants, that stimulate specific 
regions of the cochlea with specific portions of the auditory spectrum [3,13]. 
In this paper, we tackle the problem of artificial cochlear implants 
through the used of neurocomputing tools. The receptor model used here 
was developed by Gerald Wasserman of the Sensory Coding Laboratory, 
Department of Psychological Sciences, Purdue University [20], and the 
implants were performed by Richard Miyamoto of the Department of Otolar- 
yngology, Indiana University Medical School [11]. 
The idea is to introduce with the cochlear implant, the computation 
that would be performed otherwise by the natural receptors. It would there- 
fore be possible to experimentally manipulate the properties of the implant 
and measure the effect of coding variations on behavior. The model was 
constrained to be portable, simple to implant, fast enough computationally 
for on-line use, and built with a flexible paradigm, which would allow for 
modification of the different parts of the model, without having to recon- 
struct it entirely. In the next section, we review parts of the receptor model, 
and discuss the block diagram of the implant. Section 3 covers the limita- 
tions associated with the technique, and discusses the results obtained with 
a single neuron and one feedback loop. Section 4 discusses the implementa- 
tions of these models using feedforward neural networks, and the computa- 
tional advantages for doing so. 
2. COCHLEAR IMPLANTS AND THE NEURON MODEL 
Although patients cannot reliably recognize randomly chosen spoken 
words to them (when implanted with either multichannel or single channel 
devices), this is not to say that no information is extracted from speech. If 
the vocabulary is reduced to a limited set of words, patients perform 
significantly better than chance, at associating the word with a member of 
the set. 
For these types of experiments, single channel implants correspond to 
reported performance of 14% to 20% better than chance, with 62% perfor- 
mance being the highest reported. For multiple channels, performances of 
95% were reported. So far no one has investigated the differences in perfor- 
mance between the two types of implants. Since the two implants have so 
many differences, it is difficult to point out the cause for the better perfor- 
mance in the multiple channel case. 
The results of such experiments are encouraging, and point to the fact 
that cochlea implants need only minor improvement to be able to mediate 
ad-lib speech perception successfully. Sensory coding studies have suggested 
a solution to the implant problem, by showing that the representation code 
generated by the sensory system is task dependent. This evidence came 
from comparison of intracellular recordings taken from a single receptor of 
intact subjects. 
This coding evidence suggests that the temporal dispersion (time 
integration) found in natural receptors would be a necessary part of any 
785 
cochlear implant. Present cochlear implants have no dispersion at all. Fig- 
ure 2 shows the block diagram for a representative cochlear implant, the 
House-Urban stimulator. The acoustic signal is picked up by the micro- 
phone, which sends it to an AM oscillator. This modulation step is neces- 
sary to induce an electro-magnetic coupling between the external and inter- 
nal coil. The internal coil has been surgically implanted, and it is connected 
to a pair of wires implanted inside and outside the cochlea. 
Just incorporating the temporal dispersion model to an existing device 
would not replicate the fact that in natural receptors, temporal dispersion 
appears in conjunction to other operations which are strongly non linear. 
There are operations like selection of a portion of the spectrum, rectification, 
compression, and time-dispersion to be considered. 
In figure 3, a modified implant is shown, which takes into consideration 
some of these operations. It is depicted as a single-channel implant, 
although the ultimate goal is to make it multichannel. Details of the opera- 
tion of this device can be found elsewhere [21]. Here, it is important to men- 
tion that the implant would also have a compression/rectification function, 
and it would receive a feedback from the integrator stage in order to control 
its gain. 
3. CHARACTERISTICS AND RESULTS OF THE IMPLANTS 
The above model has been implemented as an off-line process, and then 
the patients were exposed to a preprocessed signal which emulated the 
operation of the device. It is not easy to define the amount of feedback 
needed in the system or the amount of time dispersion. It could also be that 
these parameters are variable across different conditions. Another variance 
in the experiment is the amount of damage (and type) among different indi- 
viduals. So, these parameters have to be determined clinically. 
The coupling between the artificial receptor and the natural system also 
presents problems. If a physical connection is used, it increases the risk of 
infections. When inductive methods are used, the coupling is never ideal. If 
portability and limited power is of concern in the implementation, then the 
limited energy available for coupling has to be used very effectively. 
The computation of the receptor model has to be made in a way to 
allow for fast implementation. The signal transformation is to be computed 
on-line. Also, the results from clinical studies should be able to be incor- 
porated fairly easily without having to reengineer the implant. 
Now we present the results of the implementation of the transfer func- 
tion of figure 4. Patients, drawn from a population described elsewhere 
[11,12,14], were given spoken sentences processed off-line, and simultaneously 
presented with a couple of words related to the context. Only one of them 
was the correct answer. The patient had two buttons, one for each alterna- 
tive; he/she was to press the button which corresponded to the correct alter- 
native. The results are shown in the tables below.
