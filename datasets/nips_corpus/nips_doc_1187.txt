Abstract 
This paper develops arguments for a family of temporal log-linear models 
to represent spatio-temporal correlations among the spiking events in a 
group of neurons. The models can represent not just pairwise correlations 
but also correlations of higher order. Methods are discussed for inferring 
the existence or absence of correlations and estimating their strength. 
A frequentist and a Bayesian approach to correlation detection are 
compared. The frequentist method is based on G 2 statistic with estimates 
obtained via the Max-Ent principle. In the Bayesian approach a Markov 
Chain Monte Carlo Model Composition (MC 3) algorithm is applied to 
search over connectivity structures and Laplace's method is used to 
approximate their posterior probability. Performance of the methods was 
tested on synthetic data. The methods were applied to experimental data 
obtained by the fourth author by means of measurements carried out on 
behaving Rhesus monkeys at the Hadassah Medical School of the Hebrew 
University. As conjectured, neural connectivity structures need not be 
neither hierarchical nor decomposable.

1 INTRODUCTION 
Hebb conjectured that information processing in the brain is achieved through 
collective action of groups of neurons, which he called cell assemblies (Hebb, 1949). 
followers were leg with a twofold challenge: 
� to define cell assemblies in an unambiguous way. 
� to conceive and carry out the experiments that demonstrate their existence. 
the

Cell assemblies have been defined in various sometimes conflicting ways, both in terms of 
anatomy and of shared function. One persistent approach characterizes the cell assembly 
by near-simultaneity or some other specific timing relation in the firing of the involved 
neurons. If two neurons converge on a third one, their synaptic influence is much larger 
for near-coincident firing, due to the spario-temporal summation in the dendrite 
(Abeles, 1991; Abeles et al. 1993). Thus syn-ftring is directly available to the brain as a 
potential code. 
The second challenge has led physiologists to develop methods to observe the 
simultaneous activity of individual neurons to seek evidence for spario-temporal patterns. 
It is now possible to obtain multi-unit recordings of up to 1 O0 neurons in awake behaving 
animals. In the data we analyze, the spiking events (in the 1 msec range) are encoded as 
sequences of O's and l's, and the activity of the whole group is described as a sequence of 
binary configurations. This paper presents a statistical model in which the parameters 
represent spario-temporal firing patterns. We discuss methods for estimating these 
pararameters and drawing inferences about which interactions are present. 
2 PARAMETERS FOR SPATIO-TEMPORAL FIRING PATTERNS 
The term spatial correlation has been used to denote synchronous firing of a group of 
neurons, while the term temporal correlation has been used to indicate chains of firing 
events at specific temporal intervals. Terms like couple or triplet have been used to 
denote spatio-temporal patterns of two or three neurons (Abeles et al., 1993; Gain, 1996) 
firing simultaneously or in sequence. Establishing the presence of such patterns is not 
straightforward. For example, three neurons may fire together more often than expected 
by chance  without exhibiting an authentic third order interaction. This phenomenon may 
be due, for instance, to synchronous firing of two couples out of the three neurons. 
Authentic triplets, and, in general, authentic n-th order correlations, must therefore be 
distinguished from correlations that can be explained in terms of lower order interactions. 
In what follows, we present a parameterized model that represents a spario-temporal 
correlation by a parameter that depends on the involved neurons and on a set of time 
intervals, where synchronization is characterized by all time intervals being zero. 
Assume that the sequence of configurations -t = (xct,',xrN,t) of Nneurons forms a 
Markov chain of order r. Let  be the time step, and denote the conditional distribution 
for X__ t given previous configurations by p(x, [Xct_s),X(t_2S),...,Xct_r6)). We 
assume that all transition probabilities are strictly positive and expand the logarithm of 
the conditional distribution as: 
that is to say, more often than predicted by the null hypothesis of independence.

interaction strength for the interaction on subset A. Clearly, 0 A = 0 is equivalent to 
A  ,w, and is taken to indicate absence of an order-lA I interaction among neurons in 
A. we denote the structure-specific vector of non-zero interaction strengths by _0_0s. 
Consider a set A of N binary neurons and denote by ]9 the probability distribution on 
the binary configurations of A. 
DEFINITION 1: We say that neurons ,i2 ,',ik d exhibit a spatio-temporal 
pattern if there is a set of time intervals rnt, rn2t,..., rnkt with at least one

Of course (2) is unrealistic. Temporal correlation of some kind is always present, one 
such example being the refractory period after firing. Nevertheless, (2) may be adequate in 
cases of weak temporal correlation. Although the models (1) and (2) are statistical not 
physiological, it is an established conjecture that synaptic connection between two 
neurons will manifest as a non-zero 0 A for the corresponding set g in the temporal 
model (1). Another example leading to non-zero 0 A will be simultaneous activation of 
the neurons in g due to a common input, as illustrated in Figure 1 below. Such a 0 A 
will appear in model (1) with time intervals equal to 0. An attractive feature of our 
models is that it is capable of distinguishing between cases a. and b. of Figure 1. This 
can be seen by extending the model (2) to include the external neurons (H in case a., H,K 
in case b.) and then marginalizing. An information-theoretic argument supports the 
choice of 0 A  0 as a natural indicator of an order-I A I interaction among the neurons 
in g. Assume that we are in the case of no temporal correlation. The absence of 
interaction of order I A I

among neurons in A should be taken to mean that the distribution is determined by the 
marginal distributions on proper subsets of m. A well established criterion for selecting 
a distribution among those matching the lower order marginals fixed by proper subsets of 
A, is Max-Ent. According to the Max-Ent principle the distribution that maximizes 
entropy is the one which is maximally non-committal with regard to missing information. 
The probability distribution ]9' that maximizes entropy among distributions with the 
same marginals as the distribution ]9 on proper subsets of m has a log-linear 
expansion in which only 0 B , B c A, B A can possibly be non-zero. 2 
3 THE FREQUENTIST APPROACH 
We treat here the case of no temporal dependencies. The general case is treated in 
Martignon-Deco, 1997; Deco-Martignon, 1997. We also assume that our data are 
stationary. We test the presence of synchronization of neurons in m by the following 
procedure: we condition on silence of neurons in the complement of m in A and call the 
resulting frequency distribution p . We construct the Max-Ent model determined by the 
marginals of p on proper subsets of m. The well-known method for constructing this 
type of Max-Ent models is the I.P.F.P. Algorithm (Bishop et ai.,1975). We propose 
here another simpler and quicker procedure: 
If B is a subset of A, denote by /B the configuration that has a component 1 for 
every index in B and 0 elsewhere. 
Define ]9*(/B) = ]9('/ ) + (--l)lBI A, where A is to be determined by solving for 
0 4 -= 0, where 0 4 is the coefficient corresponding to A in the log-expansion of ]9 * 
As can be shown (Martignon et al, 1995), 0 4can be written as 
2 This was observed by J. Good in 1963 (Bishop et al. 1975). It is interesting to note that ]9' 
minimizes the Kullback-Leibler distance from ]9 in the manifold of distributions with a log- 
linear expansion in which only 0t , B c A, B : A can possibly be non-zero.
