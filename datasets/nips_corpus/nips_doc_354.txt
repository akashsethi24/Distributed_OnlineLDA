Abstract 
We present a generic neural network architecture capable of con- 
trolling non-linear plants. The network is composed of dynamic, 
parallel, linear maps gated by non-linear switches. Using a recur- 
rent form of the back-propagation algorithm, control is achieved 
by optimizing the control gains and task-adapted switch parame- 
ters. A mean quadratic cost function computed across a nominal 
plant trajectory is minimized along with performance constraint 
penalties. The approach is demonstrated for a control task con- 
sisting of landing a commercial aircraft in difficult wind conditions. 
We show that the network yields excellent performance while re- 
maining within acceptable damping response constraints. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
This paper illustrates how a recurrent back-propagation neural network algorithm 
(Rumelhart, Hinton & Williams, 1986) may be exploited as a procedure for con- 
trolling complex systems. In particular, a simplified mathematical model of an 
aircraft landing in the presence of severe wind gusts was developed and simulated. 
A recurrent back-propagation neural network architecture was then designed to 
numerically estimate the parameters of an optimal non-linear control law for land- 
ing the aircraft. The performance of the network was then evaluated. 
1.1 A TYPICAL CONTROL SYSTEM 
A typical control system consists of a controller and a process to be controlled. The 
contro!ler's function is to accept task inputs along with process outputs and to de- 
termine control signals tailored to the response characteristics of the process. The

physical process to be controlled can be electro-mechanical, aerodynamic, etc. 
and generally has well defined behavior. It may be subjected to disturbances from 
its external environment. 
1.2 CONTROLLER DESIGN 
Many variations of both classical and modern methods to design control systems 
are described in the literature. Classical methods use linear approximations of the 
plant to be controlled and some loosely defined response specifications such as 
bandwidth (speed of response) and phase margin (degree of stability). Classical 
methods are widely used in practice, even for sophisticated control problems. 
Modern methods are more universal and generally assume that a performance in- 
dex for the process is specified. Controllers are then designed to optimize the 
performance index. Our approach relates more to modern methods. 
Narendra and Parthasarathy (1990) and others have noted that recurrent back- 
propagation networks can implement gradient descent algorithms that may be used 
to optimize the performance of a system. The essence of such methods is first to 
propagate performance errors back through the process and then back through the 
controller to give error signals for updating the controller parameters. Figure 1 
provides an overview of the interaction of a neural control law with a complex 
system and possible performance indices for evaluating various control laws. The

more subjective in nature

reward or penalty functions on categories of performance (e.g., good or bad). 
2 A GENERIC NON-LINEAR CONTROL ARCHITECTURE 
Many complex systems are in fact non-linear or multi-modal. That is, their 
behavior changes in fundamental ways as a function of their position in the state 
space. In practice, controllers are often designed for such systems by treating them 
as a collection of systems linearized about a setpoint in state space. A linear 
controller can then be determined separately for each of these system modes. 
These observations suggest that a reasonable approach for controlling non-linear 
or multi-modal systems would be to design a multi-modal control law. 
2.1 THE SWITCHING PRINCIPLE 
The architecture of our proposed general non-linear control law for multi-mod- 
al plants is shown in Figure 2. Task inputs and process outputs are entered into

multiple basic controller 
blocks (shown within the 
shaded box of Figure 2). 
Each basic controller block 
first determines a weighted 
sum of the task inputs and 
process outputs (multipli- 
cation by weights W). 
Then, the degree to which 
the weighted sum passes 
through the block is modi- 
fied by means of a saturat- 
ing switch and multiplier. 
The input to the switch is 
itself another weighted sum 
of the task inputs and process outputs (multiplication by weights V). If the input to 
the saturating switch is large, its output is unity and the weighted sum (weighted by 
W) is passed through unchanged. At the other extreme, if the saturating switch has 
zero output, the weighted sum of task inputs and process outputs does not appear in 
the output. When these basic controller blocks are replicated and their outputs are 
added, control signals consist of weighted sums of the controller inputs that can be 
selected and/or blended by the saturating switches. The overall effect is a prototyp- 
ical feed-forward and feedback controller with selectable gains and multiple path- 
ways where the overall equivalent gains are a function of the task inputs and process 
outputs. The resulting architecture yields a sigrna-pi processing unit in the final 
controller (Rumelhart, Hinton & Williams, 1986). 
2.2 MODELLING DYNAMIC MAPPINGS 
Weights shown in Figure 2 may be constant and represent a static relationship be- 
tween input and control. However, further controller functionality is obtained by 
considering the weights V and W as dynamic mappings. For example, proportional 
plus integral plus derivative (PID) feedback may be used to ensure that process 
outputs follow task inputs with adequate steady-state error and transient damping. 
Thus, the weights can express parameters of various generally useful control func- 
tions. These functions, when combined with the switching principle, yield rich 
capabilities that can be adapted to the task at hand. 
3 AIRCRAFt LANDING 
The generic neural network architecture of Figure 2 and the associated neural net- 
work techniques were tested with a real-world application: automatic landing of 
an aircraft. Here, we describe the aircraft and environment model during landing. 
3.1 GLIDESLOPE AND FLARE 
During aircraft landing, the final two phases of a landing trajectory consist of a 
glideslope phase and a flare phase. Figure 3 shows these two phases. Flare 
occurs at about 45 feet. Glideslope is characterized by a linear downward slope; 
flare by an exponential shaped curve. When the aircraft begins flare, its response 
characteristics are changed to make it more sensitive to the pilot's actions, making 
the process multi-modal or non-linear over the whole trajectory.

3.2 STATE EQUATIONS 
Linearized equations of motion were used for the aircraft during each phase. They 
are adequate during the short period of time spent during glideslope and flare. A 
pitch stability augmentation system and an auto-throttle were added to the aircraft 
state equations to damp the bare airframe oscillatory behavior and provide speed 
control. The function of the autoland controller is to transform information about 
desired and actual trajectories into the aircraft pitch command. This is input to the 
pitch stability augmentation system to develop the aircraft elevator angle that in 
turn controls the aircraft's actual pitch angle. Simplifications retain the overall 
quality of system response (i.e., high frequency dynamics were neglected). 
3.3 WIND MODEL 
The environment influences the process through wind disturbances represented by 
constant velocity and turbulence components. The magnitude of the constant ve- 
locity component is a function of altitude (wind shear). Turbulence is a stochastic 
process whose mean and variance are functions of altitude. For the horizontal and 
vertical wind turbulence velocities, the so-called Dryden spectra for spatial turbu- 
lence distribution are assumed. These are amenable to simulation and show rea- 
sonable agreement with measured data (Neuman & Foster, 1970). The generation 
of turbulence is effected by applying Gaussian white noise to coloring filters. 
4 NEURAL NETWORK LEARNING IMPLEMENTATION 
As previously noted, modern control theory suggests that a performance index for 
evaluating control laws should first be constructed, and then the control law should 
be computed to optimize the performance index. Generally, numerical methods 
are used for estimating the parameters of a control law. Neural network algorithms 
can actually be seen as constitu
