ABSTRACT 
We present a new hypothesis that the cerebellum plays a key role in ac- 
tively controlling the acquisition of sensory information by the nervous 
system. In this paper we explore this idea by examining the function of 
a simple cerebellar-related behavior, the vestibulo-ocular reflex or 
VOR, in which eye movements are generated to minimize image slip 
on the retina during rapid head movements. Considering this system 
from the point of view of statistical estimation theory, our results sug- 
gest that the transfer function of the VOR, often regarded as a static or 
slowly modifiable feature of the system, should actually be continu- 
ously and rapidly changed during head movements. We further suggest 
that these changes are under the direct control of the cerebellar cortex 
and propose experiments to test this hypothesis. 
1. INTRODUCTION 
A major thrust of research in our laboratory involves exploring the way in which the 
nervous system actively controls the acquisition of information about the outside world. 
This emphasis is founded on our suspicion that the principal role of the cerebellum, 
through its influence on motor systems, is to monitor and optimize the quality of sensory 
information entering the brain. To explore this question, we have undertaken an investi- 
gation of the simplest example of a cerebellar-related motor activity that results in 
improved sensory inputs, the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR). This reflex is responsible 
for moving the eyes to compensate for rapid head movements to prevent retinal image 
slip which would otherwise significantly degrade visual acuity (Carpenter, 1977). 
2. VESTIBULO-OCULAR REFLEX (VOR) 
The VOR relies on the vestibular apparatus of the inner ear which is an inertial sensor 
that detects movements of the head. Vestibular output caused by head movements give 
rise to compensatory eye movements through an anatomically well described neural 
pathway in the brain stem (for a review see Ito, 1984). Visual feedback also makes an 
important contribution to compensatory eye movements during slow head movements,

but during rapid head movements with frequency components greater than about 1Hz, 
the vestibular component dominates (Carpenter, 1977). 
A simple analysis of the image stabilization problem indicates that during head rotation 
in a single plane, the eyes should be made to rotate at equal velocity in the opposite 
direction. This implies that, in a simple feedforward control model, the VOR transfer 
function should have unity gain and a 180 � phase shift. This would assure stabilized reft- 
nal images of distant objects. It tums out, however, that actual measurements reveal the 
situation is not this simple. Furman, O'Leary and Wolfe (1982), for example, found that 
the monkey VOR has approximately unity gain and 180 � phase shift only in a narrow fre- 
quency band around 2Hz. At 4Hz the gain is too high by a factor of about 30% (fig. 1).

frequencies (Data from Furman et al. (1982)). 
Given the expectation of unity gain, one might be tempted to conclude from the monkey 
data that the VOR simply does not perform well at high frequencies. But 4Hz is not a 
very high frequency for head movements, and perhaps it is not the VOR which is 
performing poorly, but the simplified analysis using classical control theory. In this 
paper, we argue that the VOR uses a more sophisticated strategy and that the excessive 
gain in the system seen at higher frequencies actually improves VOR performance. 
3. OPTIMAL ESTIMATION 
In order to understand the discrepancy between the predictions of simple control theory 
models and measured VOR dynamics, we believe it is necessary to take into account 
more of the real world conditions under which the VOR operates. Examples include 
noisy head velocity measurements, conduction delays and multiple, possibly conflicting, 
measurements of head velocity, acceleration, muscle contractions, etc., generated by 
different sensory modalities. The mathematical framework that is appropriate for analyz- 
412 Paulin, Nelson and Bower 
ing problems of this kind is stochastic state-space dynamical systems theory (Davis and 
Vinter, 1985). This framework is an extension of classical linear dynamical systems the- 
ory that accommodates multiple inputs and outputs, nonlinearifies, time-varying dynam- 
ics, noise and delays. One area of application of the state space theory has been in target 
tracking, where the basic principle involves using knowledge of the dynamics of a target 
to estimate its most probable trajectory given imprecise data. The VOR can be viewed as 
a target tracking system whose target is the world, which moves in head coordinates. 
We have reexamined the VOR from this point of view. 
The Basic VOR. 
To begin our analysis of the VOR we have modeled the eye-head-neck system as a 
damped inverted pendulum with linear restoring forces (fig. 2) where the model system is 
driven by random (Gaussian white) torque. Within this model, we want to predict the 
correct compensatory eye movements during head movements to stabilize the 
direction in which the eye is pointing. Figure 2 shows the amplitude spectrum of head 
velocity for this model. In this case, the parameters of the model result in a system that 
has a natural resonance in the range of 1 to 2 Hz and attenuates higher frequencies.

We provide noisy measurements of head velocity and then ask what transfer function, 
or filter, will give the most accurate eye movement compensation? This is an estima- 
tion problem and, for Gaussian measurement error, the solution was discovered by 
Kalman and Bucy (1961). The optimal filter or estimator is often called the Kalman- 
Bucy filter. The gain and phase plots of the optimal filter for tracking movements of the 
inverted pendulum model are shown in figure 3. It can be seen that the gain of the opti- 
mal estimator for this system peaks near the maximum in the spectrum of head-neck 
velocity (fig. 2). This is a general feature of optimal filters. Accordingly, to accurately 
compensate for head movement in this system, the VOR would need to have a frequency 
dependent gain.

Time Varying dynamics and the VOR 
So far we have considered our model for VOR optimization only in the simple case of a 
constant head-neck velocity power spectrum. Under natural conditions, however, this 
spectrum would be expected to change. For example, when gait changes from walking to 
running, corresponding changes in the VOR transfer function would be necessary to 
maintain optimal performance. To explore this, we added a second inverted pendulum to 
our model to simulate body dynamics. We simulated changes in gait by changing the 
resonant frequency of the trunk. Figure 4 compares the spectra of head-neck velocity 
with two different trunk parameters. As in the previous example, we then computed 
transfer functions of the optimal filters for estimating head velocity from noisy measure- 
ments in these two cases. The gain and phase characteristics of these filters are also 
shown in Figure 5. These plots demonstrate that significant changes in the transfer 
function of the VOR would be necessary to maintain visual acuity in our model system 
under these different conditions. Of course, in the real situation head-neck dynamics will 
change rapidly and continuously with changes in gait, posture, substrate, etc. requiring 
rapid continuous changes in VOR dynamics rather than the simple switch implied here.

4. SIGNIFICANCE TO THE REAL VOR 
Our results show that the optimal VOR transfer function requires a frequency dependent 
gain to accurately adjust to a wide range of head movements under real world conditions. 
Thus, the deviations from unity gain seen in actual measurements of the VOR may not 
represent poor, but rather optimal, performance. Our modeling similarly suggests that 
several other experimental results can be reinterpreted. For example, localized peaks or 
valleys in the VOR gain function can be induced experimentally through prolonged sinu- 
soidal oscillations of subjects wearing magnifying or reducing lenses. However, this 
frequency selectivity is not thought to occur naturally and has been interpreted to im- 
ply the existence of frequency selective channels in the VOR control network (Lisberger, 
Miles and Optican, 1983). In our view there is no real distinction between this phenom- 
enon and the excessive gain in normal monkey VOR; in each case the VOR optimizes 
its response for the particular task which it has to solve. This is testable. If we are cor- 
rect, then frequency selective gain changes will occur following prolonged narrow-band 
rotation in the light without wearing lenses. In the classical framework there is no reason 
for any gain changes to occur in this situation.
