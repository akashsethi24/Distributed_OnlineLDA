Abstract 
Biophysical modeling studies have previously shown that cortical 
pyramidal cells driven by strong NMDA-type synaptic currents 
and/or containing dendritic voltage-dependent Ca ++ or Na + chan- 
nels, respond more strongly when synapses are activated in several 
spatially clustered groups of optimal size in comparison to the 
same number of synapses activated diffusely about the dendritic 
arbor [8]. The nonlinear intradendritic interactions giving rise to 
this cluster sensitivity property are akin to a layer of virtual non- 
linear hidden units in the dendrites, with implications for the cel- 
lular basis of learning and memory [7, 6], and for certain classes of 
nonlinear sensory processing [8]. In the present study, we show that 
a single neuron, with access only to excitatory inputs from unori- 
ented ON- and OFF-center cells in the LGN, exhibits the principal 
nonlinear response properties of a complex cell in primary visual 
cortex, namely orientation tuning coupled with translation invari- 
ance and contrast insensitivity. We conjecture that this type of 
intradendritic processing could explain how complex cell responses 
can persist in the absence of oriented simple cell input [13].

I INTRODUCTION 
Simple and complex cells were first described in visual cortex by Hubel and Wiesel 
[4]. Simple cell receptive fields could be subdivided into ON and OFF subregions, 
with spatial summation within a subregion and antagonism between subregions; 
cells of this type have historically been modeled as linear filters followed by a thresh- 
olding nonlinearity (see [13]). In contrast, complex cell receptive fields cannot gen- 
erally be subdivided into distinct ON and OFF subfields, and as a group exhibit 
a number of fundamentally nonlinear behaviors, including (1) orientation tuning 
across a receptive field much wider than an optimal bar, (2) larger responses to 
thin bars than thick bars--in direct violation of the superposition principle, and (3) 
sensitivity to both light and dark bars across the receptive field. 
The traditional Hubel-Wiesel model for complex cell responses involves a hierarchy, 
consisting of center-surround inputs that drive simple cells, which in turn provide 
oriented, phase-dependent input to the complex cell. By pooling over a set of simple 
cells with different positions and phases, the complex cell could respond selectively 
to stimulus orientation, while generalizing over stimulus position and contrast. A 
pure hierarchy involving simple cells is challenged, however, by a variety of more 
recent experimental results indicating many complex cells receive monosynaptic in- 
put from LGN cells [3], or do not depend on simple cell input [10, 5, 1]. It remains 
unknown how complex cell responses might derive from intracortical network com- 
putations that do no depend on simple cells, or whether they could originate directly 
from intracellular computations. 
Previous biophysical modeling studies have indicated that the input-output function 
of a dendritic tree containing excitatory voltage-dependent membrane mechanisms 
can be abstracted as low-order polynomial function, i.e. a big sum of little products 
(see [9] for review). The close match between this type of computation and energy 
models for complex cells [12, 11, 2] suggested that a single-cell origin of complex 
cell responses was possible. 
In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that local nonlinear processing in 
the dendritic tree of a single neuron, which receives only excitatory synaptic input 
from unoriented center-surround LGN cells, could in and of itself generate nonlin- 
ear complex cell response properties, including orientation selectivity, coupled with 
position and contrast invariance. 
2 METHODS 
2.1 BIOPHYSICAL MODELING 
Simulations of a layer 5 pyramidal cell from cat visual cortex (fig. 1) were carried 
out in NEURON 1. Biophysical parameters and other implementation details were 
as in [8] and/or shown in Table 2, except dendritic spines were not modeled here. 
The soma contained modified Hodgkin-Huxley channels with peak somatic conduc- 
tances of.sa and ODR 0.20 S/cm 2 and 0.12 S/cm 2, respectively; dendritic membrane 
was electrically passive. Each synapse included both an NMDA and AMPA-type

channel implementations courtesy Alan Destexhe and Zach Mainen.

excitatory conductances (see Table 1). Conductances were scaled by an estimate 
of the local input resistance, to keep local EPSP size approximately uniform across 
the dendritic tree. Inhibitory synapses were not modeled. 
2.2 MAPPING VISUAL STIMULI ONTO THE DENDRITIC TREE 
A stimulus image consisted of a 64 x 64 pixel array containing a light or dark 
bar (pixel value kl against a background of 0). Bars of length 45 and width 7 
were presented at various orientations and positions within the image. Images were 
linearly filtered through difference-of-Gaussian receptive fields (center width: 0.6, 
surround width: 1.2, with no DC response). Filtered images were then mapped 
onto 64 x 64 arrays of ON-center and OFF-center LGN cells, whose outputs were 
thresholded at k0.02 respectively. In a crude model of gain control, only a random 
subset of 100 of the LGN neurons remained active to drive the modeled cortical 
cell. 
Each LGN neuron gave rise to a single synapse onto the cortical cell's dendritic 
tree. In a given run, excitatory synapses originating from the 100 active LGN cells 
were activated asynchronously at 40 Hz, while all other synapses remained silent. 
The spatial arrangement of connections from LGN cells onto the pyramidal cell 
dendrites was generated automatically, such that pairs of LGN cells which are co- 
active during presentations of optimally oriented bars formed synapses at nearby 
sites in the dendritic tree. The activity of the LGN cell array to an optimally 
oriented bar is shown in fig. 3. Frequently co-activated pairs of LGN neurons are 
hereafter referred to as friend-pairs, and lie in a geometric arrangement as shown 
in fig. 4. Correlation-based clustering of friend-pairs was achieved by (1) choosing 
a random LGN cell and placing it at the next available dendritic site, (2) randomly

choosing one of its friends and placing it at the next available dendritic site, and so 
on, until until either all of the cell's friends had already been deployed, in which case 
a new cell was chosen at random to restart the sequence, or all cells had been chosen, 
meaning that all of the 8192 (= 64 x 64 x 2) LGN synapses had been successfully 
mapped onto the dendritic tree. In previous modeling work it was shown that this 
type of clustering of correlated inputs on dendrites is the natural outcome of a 
balance between activity-independent synapse formation, and activity dependent 
synapse stabilization [6]. 
This method guaranteed that an optimally oriented bar stimulus activated a larger 
number of friend-pairs on average than did bars at non-optimal orientations. This 
led in turn to relatively clustery distributions of activated synapses in the dendrites 
in response to optimal bar orientations, in comparison to non-optimal orientations. 
In previous work, it was shown that synapses activated in clusters about a dendritic 
arbor could produce significantly larger cell responses than the same number of 
synapses activated diffusely about the dendritic tree [7, 8]. 
3 Results 
Results for two series of runs are shown in fig. 5. For each bar stimulus, average 
spike rate was measured over a 250 ms period, beginning with the first spike initiated 
after stimulus onset (if any). This measure de-emphasized the initial transient climb 
off the resting potential, and provided a rough steady-state measure of stimulus 
effectiveness. Spike rates for 30 runs were averaged for each input condition. 
Orientation tuning curves for a thin bar (7 x 45 pixels) are shown in fig. 5. The 
orientation tuning peaks sharply within about 10 ï¿½ of vertical, and then decays 
slowly for larger angles. Tuning is apparent both for dark and light bars, and 
remains independent of location within the receptive field.
