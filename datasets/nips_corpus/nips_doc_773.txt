Abstract 
(Masino and Knudsen 1990) showed some remarkable results which 
suggest that head motion in the barn owl is controlled by distinct 
circuits coding for the horizontal and vertical components of move- 
ment. This implies the existence of a set of orthogonal internal co- 
ordinates that are related to meaningful coordinates of the external 
world. No coherent computational theory has yet been proposed 
to explain this finding. I have proposed a simple model which pro- 
vides a framework for a theory of low-level motor learning. I show 
that the theory predicts the observed microstimulation results in 
the barn owl. The model rests on the concept of Optimal Un- 
supervised Motor Learning, which provides a set of criteria that 
predict optimal internal representations. I describe two iterative 
Neural Network algorithms which find the optimal solution and 
demonstrate possible mechanisms for the development of internal 
representations in animals. 
I INTRODUCTION 
In the sensory domain, many algorithms for unsupervised learning have been pro- 
posed. These algorithms learn depending on statistical properties of the input 
data, and often can be used to find useful intermediate sensory representations

by extracting important features from the environment (Kohonen 1982, Sanger 
1989, Linsker 1989, Becker 1992, for example). An extension of these ideas to the 
domain of motor control has been proposed in (Sanger 1993). This work defined the 
concept of Optimal Unsupervised Motor Learning as a method for determining 
optimal internal representations for movement. These representations are intended 
to model the important controllable components of the sensory environment, and 
neural networks are capa.ble of learning the computations necessary to gain control 
of these components. 
In order to use this theory as a model for biological systems, we need methods to 
infer the form of biological internal representations so that these representations 
can be compared to those predicted by the theory. Discrepancies between the 
predictions and results may be due either to incorrect assumptions in the model, or 
to constraints on biological systems which prevent them from achieving optimality. 
In either case, such discrepancies can lead to improvements in the model and are 
thus important for our understanding of the computations involved. On the other 
hand, if the model succeeds in making qualitative predictions of biological responses, 
then we can claim that the biological system possesses the optimality properties of 
the model, although it is unlikely to perform its computations in exactly the same 
manner. 
2 BARN OWL EXPERIMENTS 
A relevant set of experiments was performed by (Masino and Knudsen 1990) in 
the barn owl. These experiments involved microstimulation of sites in the optic 
teeturn responsible for head movement. By studying the responses to stimulation 
at different sites separated by short or long time intervals, it was possible to infer the 
existence of distinct channels for head movement which could be made refractory 
by prior stimulation. These channels were oriented in the horizontal and vertical 
directions in external coordinates, despite the fact that the neck musculature of the 
barn owl is sufficiently complex that such orientations appear unrelated to any set 
616 Sanger 
of natural motor coordinates. This result raises two related questions. First, why 
are the two channels orthogonal with respect to external Cartesian coordinates, and 
second, why are they oriented horizontally and vertically? 
The theory of Optimal Unsupervised Motor Learning described below provides a 
model which attempts to answer both questions. It automatically develops orthogo- 
nal internal coordinates since such coordinates can be used to minimize redundancy 
in the internal representation and simplify computation of motor commands. The 
selection of the internal coordinates will be based on the statistics of the components 
of the sensory data which are controllable, so that if horizontal and vertical move- 
ments are distinguished in the environment then these components will determine 
the orientation of intermediate channels. We can hypothesize that the horizontal 
and vertical directions are distinguished in the owl by their relation to sensory in- 
formation generated from physical properties of the environment such as gravity or 
symmetry properties of the owl's head. In the simulation below, I show that reason- 
able assumptions on such symmetry properties are sufficient to guarantee horizontal 
and vertical orientations of the intermediate coordinate system. 
3 OPTIMAL UNSUPERVISED MOTOR LEARNING 
Optimal Unsupervised Motor Learning (OUML) attempts to invert the dynamics of 
an unknown plant while maintaining control of the most important modes (Sanger 
1993). Figure I shows the general structure of the control loop, where the plant P 
maps motor commands u into sensory outputs y: Pu, the adaptive sensory trans- 
formation G maps sensory data y into a reduced order intermediate representation 
z -- Gy, and the adaptive motor transformation N maps desired values of z into the 
motor commands u = Nz which achieve them. Let 2 = GPNz be the value of the 
intermediate variables after movement, and  - PNGy be the resulting value of the 
sensory variables. For any chosen value of z we want 2: z, so that we successfully 
control the intermediate variables. 
In (Sanger 1993) it was proposed that we want to choose z to have lower dimen- 
sionality than y and to represent only the coordinates which are most important 
for controlling the desired behavior. Thus, in general,   y and Ily- $11 is the 
performance error. OUML can then be described as 
1. Minimize the movement error 1t9- 
2. Subject to accurate control 2 = z. 
These criteria lead to a choice of internal representation that maximizes the loop 
gain through the plant. 
Theorem 1: (Sanger 1993) For any sensory mapping G there exists a motor 
mapping N such that � - z, and � - E[lly- ll] is minimized when G is chosen to 
minimize E[]ly- where is such that = I. 
The function  is an arbitrary right inverse of G, and this function determines the 
asymptotic values of the unobserved modes. In other words, since G in general is 
dimensionality-reducing, z - Gy will not respond to all the modes in y so that 
dissimilar states may project to identical intermediate control variables z. The

Figure 2: Special cases of Theorem 1. If the plant inverse is linear or can be 
approximated using a sum of radial basis functions or a polynomial, then simple 
closed-form solutions exist for the optimal sensory network and the motor network 
only needs to be linear or polynomial. 
function -G is a projection operator that determines the resulting plant output 
 for any desired value of y. Unsu_pervised motor learning is optimal when the 
projection surface determined by G-1G is the best approximation to the statistical 
density of desired values of y. 
Without detailed knowledge of the plant, it may be difficult to find the general 
solution described by the theorem. Fortunately, there are several important special 
cases in which simple closed-form solutions exist. These cases are summarized 
in figure 2 and are determined by the class of functions to which the plant inverse 
belongs. If the plant inverse can be approximated as a sum of radial basis functions, 
then the motor network need only be linear and the optimal sensory network is given 
by the eigenvectors of the autocorrelation matrix of the basis function outputs (as 
in (Sanger 1991a)). If the plant inverse can be approximated as a polynomial over 
a set of basis functions (as in (Sanger 1991b)), then the motor network needs to be 
a polynomial, and again the optimal sensory network is given by the eigenvectors 
of the autocorrelation matrix of the basis function outputs. 
Since the model of the barn owl proposed below has a linear inverse we are interested 
in the linear case, so we know that the mappings N and G need only be linear and 
that the optimal value of G is given by the eigenvectors of the autocorrelation matrix 
of the plant outputs y. In fact, it can be shown that the optimal N and G are given 
by the matrices of left and right singular vectors of the plant inverse (Sanger 1993). 
Although several algorithms for iterative computation of eigenvectors exist, until 
recently there were no iterative algorithms for finding the left and right singular 
vectors. I have developed two such algorithms, called the Double Generalized 
Hebbian Algorithm (DGHA) and the Orthogonal Asymmetric Encoder (OAE).
