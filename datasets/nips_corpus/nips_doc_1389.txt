Abstract 
We derive a first-order approximation of the density of maximum 
entropy for a continuous 1-D random variable, given a number of 
simple constraints. This results in a density expansion which is 
somewhat similar to the classical polynomial density expansions 
by Gram-Charlier and Edgeworth. Using this approximation of 
density, an approximation of 1-D differential entropy is derived. 
The approximation of entropy is both more exact and more ro- 
bust against outliers than the classical approximation based on 
the polynomial density expansions, without being computationally 
more expensive. The approximation has applications, for example, 
in independent component analysis and projection pursuit. 
1 Introduction 
The basic information-theoretic quantity for continuous one-dimensional random 
variables is differential entropy. The differential entropy H of a scalar random 
variable X with density f(x) is defined as 
H(X) = - / f(x)logf(x)dx. (1) 
The 1-D differential entropy, henceforth called simply entropy, has important appli- 
cations such areas as independent component analysis [2, 10] and projection pursuit 
[5, 6]. Indeed, both of these methods can be considered as a search for directions 
in which entropy is minimal, for constant variance. 
Unfortunately, the estimation of entropy is quite difficult in practice. Using defi- 
nition (1) requires estimation of the density of X, which is recognized to be both

theoretically difficult and computationally demanding. Simpler approximations of 
entropy have been proposed both in the context of projection pursuit [9] and in- 
dependent component analysis [1, 2[. These approximations are usually based on 
approximating the density f(x) using the polynomial expansions of Gram-Charlier 
or Edgeworth [11]. This construction leads to the use of higher-order cumulants, 
like kurtosis. However, such cumulant-based methods often provide a rather poor 
approximation of entropy. There are two main reasons for this. Firstly, finite- 
sample estimators of higher-order cumulants are highly sensitive to outliers: their 
values may depend on only a few, possibly erroneous, observations with large values 
[6]. This means that outliers may completely determine the estimates of cumulants, 
thus making them useless. Secondly, even if the cumulants were estimated per- 
fectly, they measure mainly the tails of the distribution, and are largely unaffected 
by structure near the centre of the distribution [5]. 
Therefore, better approximations of entropy are needed. To this end, we introduce 
in this paper approximations of entropy that are both more exact in the expectation 
and have better finite-sample statistical properties, when compared to the cumulant- 
based approximations. Nevertheless, they retain the computational and conceptual 
simplicity of the cumulant-based approach. Our approximations are based on an 
approximative maximum entropy method. This means that we approximate the 
maximum entropy that is compatible with our measurements of the random variable 
X. This maximum entropy, or further approximations thereof, can then be used as 
a meaningful approximation of the entropy of X. To accomplish this, we derive a 
first-order approximation of the density that has the maximum entropy given a set 
of constraints, and then use it to derive approximations of the differential entropy 
of X. 
2 Applications of Differential Entropy 
First, we discuss some applications of the approximations introduced in this pa- 
per. Two important applications of differential entropy are independent compo- 
nent analysis (ICA) and projection pursuit. 'In the general formulation of ICA 
[2], the purpose is to transform an observed random vector x - (x,...,xm) T lin- 
early into a random vector s - (s, ..., sin) T whose components are statistically 
as independent from each other as possible. The mutual dependence of the si 
is classically measured by mutual information. Assuming that the linear trans- 
formation is invertible, the mutual information I(s, ..., sin) can be expressed as 
I(s,...,sm) -- -i H($i)- H(x,...,xm)- log [det M[ where M is the matrix defin- 
ing the transformation s -- Mx. The second term on the right-hand side does not 
depend on M, and the minimization of the last term is a simple matter of differential 
calculus. Therefore, the critical part is the estimation of the 1-D entropies H($i): 
finding an efficient and reliable estimator or approximation of entropy enables an 
efficient and reliable estimation of the ICA decomposition. 
In projection pursuit, the purpose is to search for projections of multivariate data 
which have 'interesting' distributions [5, 6, 9]. Typically, interestingness is con- 
sidered equivalent with non-Gaussianity. A natural criterion of non-Gaussianity is 
entropy [6, 9], which attains its maximum (for constant variance) when the distribu- 
tion is Gaussian, and all other distributions have smaller entropies. Because of the 
difficulties encountered in the estimation of entropy, many authors have considered 
other measures of non-Gaussianity (see [3]) but entropy remains, in our view, the 
best choice of a projection pursuit index, especially because it provides a simple 
connection to ICA. Indeed, it can be shown [2] that in ICA as well as in projection 
pursuit, the basic problem is to find directions in which entropy is minimized for

constant variance. 
3 Why maximum entropy? 
Assume that the information available on the density f(x) of the scalar random 
variable X is of the form 
f(x)Gi(x)dx -- Ci, for i = 1,...,n, (2) 
wlaich means in practice that we have estimated the expectations E{Gi(X)) of n 
different functions of X. Since we are not assuming any model for the random 
variable X, the estimation of the entropy of X using this information is not a 
well-defined problem: there exist an infinite number of distributions for which the 
constraints in (2) are fulfilled, but whose entropies are very different from each 
other. In particular, the differential entropy reaches -cx> in the limit where X takes 
only a finite number of values. 
A simple solution to this dilemma is the maximum entropy method. This means 
that we compute the maximum entropy that is compatible with our constraints 
or measurements in (2), which is a well-defined problem. This maximum entropy, 
or further approximations thereof, can then be used as an approximation of the 
entropy of X. 
Our approach thus is very different from the asymptotic approach often used in 
projection pursuit [3, 5]. In the asymptotic approach, one establishes a sequence of 
functions Gi so that when n goes to infinity, the information in (2) gives an asymp- 
totically convergent approximation of some theoretical projection pursuit index. We 
avoid in this paper any asymptotic considerations, and consider directly the case of 
finite information, i.e., finite n. This non-asymptotic approach is justified by the 
fact that often in practice, only a small number of measurements of the form (2) 
are used, for computational or other reasons. 
4 Approximating the maximum entropy density 
In this section, we shall derive an approximation of the density of maximum entropy 
compatible with the measurements in (2). The basic results of the maximum entropy 
method tell us [4] that under some regularity conditions, the density fo(x) which 
satisfies the constraints (2) and has maximum entropy among all such densities, is 
of the form 
fo(x) = A exp( z aiGi(x)) , (3) 
i 
where A and ai are constants that are determined from the ci, using the constraints 
in (2) (i.e., by substituting the right-hand side of (3) for f in (2)), and the constraint 
f fo(x)dx = 1. This leads in general to a system of n + 1 non-linear equations which 
is difficult to solve. Therefore, we decide to make a simple approximation of f0. This 
is based on the assumption that the density f(x) is not very far from a Gaussian 
distribution of the same mean and variance. Such an assumption, though perhaps 
counterintuitive, is justified because we shall construct a density expansion (not 
unlike a Taylor expansion) in the vicinity of the Gaussian density. In addition, we 
can make t. he technical assumption that f(x) is near the standardized Gaussian 
density o(x) - exp(-x2/2)/x/-, since this amounts simply to making X zero- 
mean and of unit variance. Therefore we put two additional constraints in (2), 
defined by Gn+l(X) = x, cn+ = 0 and G+2(x) = x2,c+2 = 1. To further simplify 
276 A. Hyvarinen 
the calculations, let us make another, purely technical assumption: The functions 
Gi, i = 1,...,n, form an orthonormal system according to the metric defined by 
%0, and are orthogonal to all polynomials of second degree. In other words, for all 
i, j = 1, ..., n 
(x)Gi(x)Gj(x)dx = 0, if i  j ' f (x)Gi(x)xkdx = 0, k = 0, 1,2. (4) 
For any linearly independent functions Gi, this assumption can always be made 
true by ordinary Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization. 
Now, note that the assumption of near-Gaussianity implies that all the other ai in 
(3) are very small compared to an+2  -1/2, since the exponential in (3) is not far 
from exp(-x 2/2). Thus we can make a first-order approximation of the exponential 
function (detailed derivations can be found in [8]). This allows for simple solutions 
for the constants in (3), and we obtain the approximative maximum entropy density, 
which we denote by f(x):

where ci = E{Gi(X)}. To estimate this density in practice, the ci are estimated, for
