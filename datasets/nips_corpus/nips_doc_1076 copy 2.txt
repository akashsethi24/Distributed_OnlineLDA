Abstract 
We have analyzed the relationship between correlated spike count 
and the peak in the cross-correlation of spike trains for pairs of si- 
multaneously recorded neurons from a previous study of area MT 
in the macaque monkey (Zohary et al., 1994). We conclude that 
common input, responsible for creating peaks on the order of ten 
milliseconds wide in the spike train cross-correlograms (CCGs), 
is also responsible for creating the correlation in spike count ob- 
served at the two second time scale of the trial. We argue that 
both common excitation and inhibition may play significant roles 
in establishing this correlation. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
In a previous study of pairs of MT neurons recorded using a single extracellular 
electrode, it was found that the spike count during two seconds of visual motion 
stimulation had an average correlation coefficient of r = 0.12 and that this cor- 
relation could significantly limit the usefulness of pooling across increasingly large 
populations of neurons (Zohary et al., 1994). However, correlated spike count be- 
tween two neurons could in principle occur at several time-scales. Correlated drifts

in the excitability of the cells, for example due to normal biological changes or 
electrode induced changes, could cause correlation at a time scale of many min- 
utes. Alternatively, attentional or priming effects from higher areas could change 
the responsivity of the cells at the time scale of an experimental trial. Or, as sug- 
gested here, common input that changes on the order of milliseconds could cause 
correlation in spike count. The first section determines the time scale at which the 
neurons are correlated by analyzing the relationship between the peak in the spike 
train cross-correlograms (CCGs) and the correlation between the spike counts using 
a construct we call the trial CCG. The second section examines temporal structure 
that is indicative of correlated suppression of firing, perhaps due to inhibition, which 
may also contribute to the spike count correlation. 
2 THE TIME SCALE OF CORRELATION 
At the time scale of the single trial, the correlation, rsc, of spike counts x and y from 
two neurons recorded during nominally identical two second stimuli was computed 
using Pearson's correlation coefficient, 
E[xy] - ExEy 
ro: , (1) 
O' x O'y 
where E is expected value and a 2 is variance. If spike counts are converted to 
z-scores, i.e., zero mean and unity variance, then rc - E[xy], and rsc may be 
interpreted as the zero-lag value of the cross-correlation of the z-scored spike counts. 
The trial CCGs resulting from this procedure are shown for two pairs of neurons in 
Fig. 1. 
To distinguish between cases like the two shown in Fig. 1, the correlation was broken 
into a long-term component, rtt, the average value (computed using a Gaussian 
window of standard deviation 4 trials) surrounding the zero-lag value, and a short- 
term component, rt, the difference between the zero-lag value and rtt. Across 92 
pairs of neurons from three monkeys, the average rst was 0.10 (s.d. 0.17) while rtt 
was not significantly different from zero (mean 0.01, s.d. 0.11). The mean of rst 
was similar to the overall correlation of 0.12 reported by Zohary et al. (1994). 
Under certain assumptions, including that the time scale of correlation is less than 
the trial duration, rst can be estimated from the area under the spike train CCG 
and the areas under the autocorrelations (derivation omitted). Under the additional 
assumption that the spike trains are individually Poisson and have no peak in the 
autocorrelation except that which occurs by definition at lag zero, the correlation 
coefficient for spike count can be estimated by 
'peak  Area, (2) 
where AA and As are the mean firing rates of neurons A and B, and Area is the area 
under the spike train CCG peak, like that shown in Fig. 2 for one pair of neurons. 
Taking Area to be the area under the CCG between :t:32 msec gives a good estimate 
of short-term rt, as shown in Fig. 3. In addition to the strong correlation (r - 0.71) 
between rpeak and rt, rpeak is a less noisy measure, having standard deviation (not 
shown) on average one fourth as large as those of rst. 
We conclude that the common input that causes the peaks in the spike train CCGs is 
also responsible for the correlation in spike count that has been previously reported.

Figure 1: Normalized responses for two pairs of neurons and their trial cross- 
correlograms (CCGs). The upper traces show the z-scored spike counts for all 
trials in the order they occurred. Spikes were counted during the 2 sec stimulus, 
but trials occurred on average 5 sec apart, so 100 trials represents about 2.5 min- 
utes. The lower traces show the trial CCGs. For the pair of cells in the left panel, 
responsivity drifts during the experiment. The CCG (lower left) shows that the drift 
is correlated between the two neurons over nearly 100 trials. For the pair of cells 
in the right panel, the trial CCG shows a strong correlation only for simultaneous 
trials. Thus, the measured correlation coefficient (trial CCG at zero lag) seems to 
occur at a long time scale on the left but a short time scale (less than or equal to one 
trial) on the right. The zero-lag value can be broken into two components, rst and 
rtt (short term and long term, respectively, see text). The short-term component, 
rst, is the value at zero lag minus the weighted average value at surrounding lag 
times. On the left, rst  O, while on the right, rtt  O.

Figure 3: The area of the peak of the spike train CCG yields a prediction, r (see 
Eqn. 2), that is strongly correlated (r = 0.71, p < 0.00001), with the short-term 
spike count correlation coefficiem, rst. The absence of points in the lower right 
corner of the plot indicates that there are no cases of a pair of cells being strongly 
correlated without having a peak in the spike train CCG.

In Fig. 3, there are no pairs of neurons that have a short-term correlation and yet 
do not have a peak in the �32 msec range of the spike train CCG. 
3 CORRELATED SUPPRESSION 
There is little doubt that common excitatory input causes peaks like the one shown 
in Fig. 2 and therefore results in the correlated spike count at the time scale of the 
trial. However, we have also observed correlated periods of suppressed firing that 
may point to inhibition as another contribution to the CCG peaks and consequently 
to the correlated spike count. 
Fig. 4 A and B show the response of one neuron to coherent preferred and null 
direction motion, respectively. Excessively long inter-spike intervals (ISis), or gaps, 
appear in the response to preferred motion, while bursts appear in the response 
to null motion. Across a database of 84 single neurons from a previous study 
(Britten et al., 1992), the occurrence of the gaps and bursts has a symmetrical 
time course both are most prominent on average from 600-900 msec post-stimulus 
onset, although there are substantial variations from cell to cell (Bair, 1995). The 
gaps, roughly 100 msec long, are not consistent with the slow, steady adaptation 
(presumably due to potassium currents) which is observed under current injection 
in neocortical pyramidal neurons, e.g., the RS and RS2 neurons of Agmon and 
Connors (1992). 
Fig. 4 C shows spike trains from two simultaneously recorded neurons stimulated 
with preferred direction motion. The longest gaps appear to occur at about the 
same time. To assess the correlation with a cross-correlogram, we first transform 
the spike trains to interval trains, shown in Fig. 4 D for the spike trains in C. 
This emphasizes the presence of long ISis and removes some of the information 
regarding the precise occurrence times of action potentials. The interval cross- 
correlation (ICC) between each pair of interval trains is computed and averaged 
over all trials, and the average shift predictor is subtracted. Fig. 4 E and F show 
ICCs (thick lines) for two different pairs of neurons. In 17 of 31 pairs (55%), there 
were peaks in the raw ICC that were at least 4 standard errors above the level of the 
shift predictor. The peaks were on average centered (mean 4.3 msec, SD 54 msec) 
and had mean width at half-height of 139 msec (SD 59 msec). 
To isolate the cause of the peaks, the long intervals in the trains were set to the 
mean of the short intervals. Long intervals were defined as those that accounted 
for 30% of the duration of the data and were longer than all short intervals. Note 
that thi
