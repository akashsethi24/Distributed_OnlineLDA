ABSTRACT 
Ictalurid catfish use a highly developed gustatory system to 
localize, track and acquire food from their aquatic environment. 
The neural organization of the gustatory system illustrates well 
the importance of the four fundamental ingredients 
(representation, architecture, search and knowledge) of an 
intelligent system. In addition, the pipelined design of 
architecture illustrates how a goal-directed system effectively 
utilizes interactive feedback from its environment. Anatomical 
analysis of neural networks involved in target-tracking 
indicated that reticular neurons within the medullary region of 
the brainstem, mediate connections between the gustatory 
(sensory) inputs and the motor outputs of the spinal cord. 
Ele ctrophysiological analysis suggested that these neurons 
integrate selective spatic-temporal patterns of sensory input 
transduced through a rapidly adapting-type peripheral filter 
(responding tonically only to a continuously increasing stimulus 
concentration ). The connectivity and response patterns of 
reticular cells and the nature of the peripheral taste response 
suggest a unique gustation-seeking function of reticulospinal 
cells, which may enable a catfish to continuously track a 
stimulus source once its directionality has been computed. 
INTRODUCTION 
Food search is an example of a broad class of behaviors 
generally classified as goal-directed behaviors. Goal-directed 
behavior is frequently exhibited by animals, humans and some 
machines. Although a preprogrammed, hard-wired machine may achieve 
a particular goal in a relatively short time, the general and 
heuristic nature of complex goal-directed tasks, however, is best 
exhibited by animals and best studied in some of the less advanced 
animal species, such as fishes, where anatomical, electro- 
physiological and behavioral analyses can be performed relatively 
accurately and easily. 
Food search, which may lead to food acquisition and ingestion, 
is critical for the survival of an organism and, therefore, only 
highly successful systems are selected during the evolution of a 
species. The act of food search may be classified into two distinct 
phases, (i) orientation, and (ii) tracking (navigation and homing). 
In the channel catfish (the animal model utilized for this study), 
locomotion (swimming) is primarily controlled by the large forked 
caudal fin, which also mediates turning and directional swimming.

Both these forms of movement, which constitute the essential 
movements of target-tracking, involve control of the 
hypaxial/epiaxial muscles of the flank. The alternate contraction 
of these muscles causes caudal fin undulations. Each cycle of the 
caudal fin undulation provides either a symmetrical or an 
asymmetrical bilateral thrust. The former provides a net thrust 
forward, along the longitudinal axis of the fish causing it to move 
ahead, while the latter biases the direction of movement towards the 
right or left side of the fish.

Ictalurid catfishes possess a well developed gustatory system 
and use it to locate and acquire food from their aquatic 
environment l, 2,3. Behavioral evidence also indicates that ictalurid 
catfishes can detect small intensity (stimulus concentration) 
differences across their barbels (interbarbel intensity 
differences), and may use this or other extraoral taste information 
to compute the directionality in space and track a gustatory 
stimulus source 1. In other words, based upon the analysis of 
locomotion, it may be inferred that during food search, the 
gustatory sense of the catfish influences the duration and degree of 
asymmetrical or symmetrical undulations of the caudal fin, besides 
controlling reflex turns of the head and flank. Since directional 
swimming is ultimately dependent upon movement of the large caudal 
fin it may be postulated that, if the gustatory system is to 
coordinate food tracking, gustato-spinal connections exist upto the 
level of the caudal fin of the catfish (fig. 1). 
The objectives of this study were (i) to reconsider the 
functional organization of the gustatory system within the 
costraints of the four fundamental ingredients (representation, 
architecture, search and knowledge) of a naturally or artificially 
intelligent agent, (ii) to test the existence of the postulated 
gustato-spinal connections, and (iii) to de lineate as far as 
possible, using neuroanatomical and electrophysiological techniques, 
the neural mechanism/s involved in the control of goal-directed 
(foraging) behavior. 
ORGANIZATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS 
I. REPRESENTATION 
Representation refers to the translation of a particular task 
into information structures and information processes and determines 
to a great extent the efficiency and efficacy with which a solution 
to the task can be generated4. The elaborate and highly sensitive 
taste system of an ictalurid catfish consists of an extensive array 
of chemo- and mechanosensory receptors distributed over most of the 
extraoral as well as oral regions of the epithelium2,5.. 
Peripherally, branches of the facial nerve (which innervates all 
extraoral taste buds resoond to a wide range of stimulus (amino 
acids) concentrationsO,7, .e. from 10-9M to 10-3M. The taste 
activity however, adapts rapidly (phasic response) to ongoing 
stimulation of the same concentration (Fig. 2) and responds 
tonically only to continuously increasing concentrations of stimuli, 
such as L-arginine and L-alanine.

Gustatory information from the extraoral and oral epithelium is 
pipelined into two separate subsystems, facial and 
glossopharyngeal-vagal, respectively. Each subsystem processes a 
subset of the incoming information (extraoral or oral) and 
coordinates a different component of food acquisition. Food search 
is accomplished by the extraoral subsystem, while selective 
ingestion is accomplished by the oral subsystem 2 (Fig. 3). The 
extraoral gustatory information terminates in the facial lobe where 
it is represented as a well-defined topographic map 9, l0 , while the 
oral information terminates in the adjacent vagal lobe where it is 
represented as a relatively diffuse map ll. 
II. ARCHITECTURE 
The information represented in an information structure 
eventually requires an operating frame (architecture) within which 
to select and carry out the various processes. In ictalurid catfish, 
partially processed information from the primary gustatory centers 
(facial and vagal lobes) in the medullary region of the brainstem 
converges along ascending and descending pathways (Fig. 4). One of 
the centers in the ascending pathways is the secondary gustatory 
nucleus in the isthmic region which is connected to the 
corresponding nucleus of the opposite side via a large 
commissurel2,13. Facial and vagal gustatory information crosses 
over to the opposite side via this commissure thus making it 
possible for neurons to extract information about interbarbel or 
interflank intensity differences. _lthough neurons in this region 
are known to have large receptive fieldsl4, the exact function of 
this large commissural nucleus is not yet clearly established. 
It is quite clear, however, that gustatory information is at 
first ipelined into separate regions where it is processed in 
parallel �5 before converging onto neurons in the ascending (isthmic) 
and descending (reticular) processors as well as other regions 
within the medulla. The pipelined architecture underscores the 
need for differential processing of subsets of sensory inputs which 
are consequently integrated to coordinate temporal transitions 
between the various components of goal-directed behavior. 
III. SEARCH 
An important task underlying all intelligent goal directed 
activity is that of search. In artificial systems this involves 
application of several general problem-solving methods such as 
means-end analysis, generate and test methods and heuristic search 
methods. No attempt, as yet, has been made to fit any of these 
models to the food-tracking behavior of the catfish. However, 
behavioral observations suggest that the catfish uses a 
combinatorial approach resulting in a different yet optimal foraging 
strategy each time 3. 
What is interesting about biological models is that the 
intrinsic search strategy is expressed
