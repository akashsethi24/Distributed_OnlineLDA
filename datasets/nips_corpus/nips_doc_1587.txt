Abstract 
Symmetrically connected recurrent networks have recently been 
used as models of a host of neural computations. However, be- 
cause of the separation between excitation and inhibition, biolog- 
ical neural networks are asymmetrical. We study characteristic 
differences between asymmetrical networks and their symmetri- 
cal counterparts, showing that they have dramatically different 
dynamical behavior and also how the differences can be exploited 
for computational ends. We illustrate our results in the case of a 
network that is a selective amplifier. 
1 Introduction 
A large class of non-linear recurrent networks, including those studied by 
Grossberg, 9 the Hopfield net, �, and many more recent proposals for the 
head direction system, 27 orientation tuning in primary visual cortex, 25, , 3, 8 eye 
position, 2� and spatial location in the hippocampus t9 make a key simplifying 
assumption that the connections between the neurons are symmetric. Analysis 
is relatively straightforward in this case, since there is a Lyapunov (or energy) 
function 4'  that often guarantees the convergence of the motion trajectory to an 
equilibrium point. However, the assumption of symmetry is broadly false. Net- 
works in the brain are almost never symmetrical, if for no other reason than the 
separation between excitation and inhibition. In fact, the question of whether ig- 
noring the polarity of the cells is simplification or over-simplication has yet to be 
fully answered. 
Networks with excitatory and inhibitory cells (El systems, for short) have 
long been studied, 6 for instance from the perspective of pattern generation in 
invertebrates, 23 and oscillations in the thalamus 7, 24 and the olfactory system. 7, 3 
Further, since the discovery of 40 Hz oscillations or synchronization amongst cells 
in primary visual cortex of anesthetised cat, 8, 5 oscillatory models of V1 involving 
separate excitatory and inhibitory cells have also been popular, mainly from the 
perspective of how the oscillations can be created and sustained and how they can

be used for feature linking or binding?' 22, 12 However the scope for computing 
with dynamically stable behaviors such as limit cycles is not yet clear. 
In this paper, we study the computational differences between a family of EI sys- 
tems and their symmetric counterparts (which we call S systems). One inspira- 
tion for this work is Li's nonlinear EI system modeling how the primary visual 
cortex performs contour enhancement and pre-attentive region segmentation. x4, x 5 
Studies by Braun 2 had suggested that an S system model of the cortex can not 
perform contour enhancement unless additional (and biologically questionable) 
mechanisms are used. This posed a question about the true differences between 
El and S systems that we answer. We show that EI systems can take advantage of 
dynamically stable modes that are not available to S systems. The computational 
significance of this result is discussed and demonstrated in the context of models 
of orientation selectivity. More details of this work, especially its significance for 
models of the primary visual cortical system, can be found in Li & Dayan (1999)? 
2 Theory and Experiment 
Consider a simple, but biologically significant, EI system in which excitatory and 
inhibitory cells come in pairs and there are no 'long-range' connections from the 
inhibitory cells 4, 5 (to which the Lyapunov theory la' 2x does not yet apply): 
2i -- --Xi q- Ej Jijg(xj) - h(yi) + Ii Tyi -- --Yi q- -j Wijg(xj) , (1) 
where xi are the principal excitatory cells, which receive external or sensory in- 
put Ii, and generate the network outputs g(xi); Yi are the inhibitory interneurons 
(which are taken here as having no external input); function g(x) = [x - T]+ is 
the threshold non-linear activation function for the excitatory cells; h(y) is the ac- 
tivation function for the inhibitory cells (for analytical convenience, we use the 
linear form h(y) = (y - Ty) although the results are similar with the non-linear 
h(y) = [y - Ty]+); 'ry is a time-constant for the inhibitory cells; and Jij and Wij are 
the output connections of the excitatory cells. Excitatory and inhibitory cells can 
also be perturbed by Gaussian noise. 
In the limit that the inhibitory cells are made infinitely fast (% - 0), we have 
yi: -j Wijg(xj), leaving the excitatory cells to interact directly with each other: 
i -- --Xi q- Ej Zijg(xj) - h(-j Wijg(xj)) q- Ii (2) 
= --xi + -j(Jij - Wij)g(xj) + Ii q- ti (3) 
where i are constants. In this network, the neural connections Zij - Wij between 
any two cells x can be either excitatory or inhibitory, as in many abstract neural 
network models. When Jij = Jji and Wij = Wji, the network has symmetric 
connections. This paper compares EI systems with such connections and the cor- 
responding S systems. Since there are many ways of setting Zij and Wij in the EI 
system whilst keeping constant Jij - Wij, which is the effective weight in the S 
system, one may intuitively expect the EI system to have a broader computational 
range. 
The response of either system to given inputs is governed by the location and lin- 
ear stability of their fixed points. The S network is so defined as to have fixed 
points  (where/c = 0 in equation 3) that are the same as those (, ) of the EI 
network. In particular,  depends on inputs I (the input-output sensitivity) via 
a = (lI - JD 9 + WDg) -1 dI, where lI is the identity matrix, J and W are the 
connection matrices, and D is a diagonal matrix with elements [Dg]ii -- 
However, although the locations of the fixed points are the same for the EI and S 
276 Z. Li and P. Dayan 
systems, the dynamical behavior of the systems about those fixed points are quite 
different, and this is what leads to their differing computational power. 
To analyse the stability of the fixed points, consider, for simplicity the case that % = 
I in the EI system, and that the matrices JD 9 and WD9 commute with eigenvalues 
,k and ,k TM respectively for k = 1,... , N where N is the dimension of x. The local 
deviations near the fixed points along each of the N modes will grow in time if the 
real parts of the following values are positive 
,),ffr = -1 + (1/2,k 4- (� (,k) 2 - ,w)/2 for the EI system 
%s = -1 - ,w + ,k for the S system 
In the case that ,k; and ,k TM are real, then if the S system is unstable, then the E1 
system is also unstable. For if -1 + ,kf - ,k TM > 0 then (,kf) 2 -4,k TM > (,kf - 2) 2, and 
so 27' = -2 + ,kf + ((,k/) 2 - 4,k TM) 1/2 > 0. However, if the EI system is oscillatory, 
4,kw > (,�)2, then the S system is stable since -1 + ,� - ,k TM < -1 + ,� - (,�)2/4 = 
-(1 - ,�/2) 2 _< 0. Hence the E1 system can be unstable and oscillatory while the S 
system is stable. 
We are interested in the capacity of both systems to be selective amplifiers. This 
means that there is a class of inputs I that should be comparatively boosted by 
the system; whereas others should be comparatively suppressed. For instance, if 
the cells represent the orientation of a bar at a point, then the mode containing a 
unimodal, well-tuned, 'bump' in orientation space should be enhanced compared 
with poorly tuned inputs. 2s,, 8 However, if the cells represent oriented small 
bars at multiple points in visual space, then isolated smooth and straight contours 
should be enhanced compared with extended homogeneous textures j4,  s 
The quality of the systems will be judged according to how much selective ampli- 
fication they can stably deliver. The critical trade-off is that the more the selected 
mode is amplified, the more likely it is that, when the input is non-specific, the 
system will be unstable to fluctuations in the direction of the selected mode, and 
therefore will hallucinate spurious answers. 
3 The Two Point System 
A particularly simple case to consider has just two neurons (for the S system; two 
pairs of neurons for the E1 system) and weights 
/ / 
j j0 w w0 
The idea is that each node coarsely models a group of neurons, and the interac- 
tions between neurons within a group (jo and Wo) are qualitatively different from 
interactions between neurons between groups (j and w). The form of selective am- 
plification here is that symmetric or ambiguous inputs I a = 1(1, 1) should be sup- 
pressed compared with asynmetric inputs I b = 1(1, 0) (and, equivalently, I(0, 1)). 
In particular, given, I a, the system should not spontaneously generate a response 
with x significantly different from x2. Define the fixed points to be .e = .e > T 
under I and .e > T ) .e2 under I b, where T is the threshold of the excitatory 
neurons. These relationships will be true across a wide range of input levels I. The 
ratio 
- (w-j) 
d.e/dI l + ((Wo + W) (jo + j)) =1+ (4) 
R = d.e/dI = 1 + (Wo - jo) 1 + (Wo - jo) 
of the average relative responses as the input level I changes is a measure of how 
the system selectively amplifies the preferred or consistent inputs against ambigu- 
ous ones. This measure is appropriate only when the fluctuations of the system
