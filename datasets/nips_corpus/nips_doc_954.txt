Abstract 
The macaque lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) exhibits an intricate 
lamination pattern, which changes midway through the nucleus at a 
point coincident with small gaps due to the blind spot in the retina. 
We present a three-dimensional model of morphogenesis in which 
local cell interactions cause a wave of development of neuronal re- 
ceptive fields to propagate through the nucleus and establish two 
distinct lamination patterns. We examine the interactions between 
the wave and the localized singularities due to the gaps, and find 
that the gaps induce the change in lamination pattern. We explore 
critical factors which determine general LGN organization. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
Each side of the mammalian brain contains a structure called the lateral geniculate 
nucleus (LGN), which receives visual input from both eyes and sends projections to

the primary visual cortex. In primates the LGN consists of several distinct layers 
of neurons separated by intervening layers of axons and dendrites. Each layer of 
neurons maps the opposite visual hemifield in a topographic fashion. The cells com- 
prising these layers differ in terms of their type (magnocellular and parvocellular), 
their input (from ipsilateral (same side) and contralateral (opposite side) eyes), and 
their receptive field organization (ON and OFF center polarity). Cells in one layer 
receive input from one eye only (Kaas et al., 1972), and in most parts of the nucleus 
have the same functional properties (Schiller 2z Malpeli, 1978). The maps are in 
register, i.e., representations of a point in the visual field are found in all layers, and 
lie in a narrow column roughly perpendicular to the layers (Figure 1). A prominent

numbered ventral to dorsal. Posterior is to the left, where foveal (central) parts of 
the retinas are mapped; peripheral visual fields are mapped anteriorly (right). Cells 
in different layers have different morphology and functional properties: 6-P/C/ON; 
5-P/I/ON; 4-P/C/OFF; 3-P/I/OFF; 2-M/I/ON&OFF; 1-M/C/ON&OFF, where 
P is parvocellular, M is magnocellular, C is contralateral, I is ipsilateral, ON and 
OFF refer to polarities of the receptive-field centers. The gaps in layers 6, 4, and 1 
are images of the blind spot in the contralateral eye. Cells in columns perpendicular 
to the layers receive input from the same point in the visual field. 
feature in this laminar organization is the presence of cell-free gaps in some layers. 
These gaps are representations of the blind spot (the hole in the retina where the 
optic nerve exits) of the opposite retina. In the LGN of the rhesus macaque mon- 
key (Macaca mulatta) the pattern of laminar organization drastically changes at the 
position of the gaps -- foveal to the gaps there are six distinct layers, peripheral to 
the gaps there are four layers. The layers are extended two-dimensional structures 
whereas the gaps are essentially localized. However, the laminar transition occurs 
in a surface that extends far beyond the gaps, cutting completely across the main 
axis of the LGN (Malpeli 2z Baker., 1975). 
We propose a developmental model of LGN laminar morphogenesis. In particular, 
we investigate the role of the blind-spot gaps in the laminar pattern transition, and 
their extended influence over the global organization of the nucleus. In this model 
a wave of development caused by local cell interactions sweeps through the system 
(Figure 2). Strict enforcement of retinotopy maintains and propagates an initially 
localized foveal pattern. At the position of the gaps, the system is in a metastable

state, and the perturbation in retinotopy caused by the gaps is sufficient to change 
the state of the system to its preferred four-layered pattern. We study the critical 
factors in this model, and make some predictions about LGN morphogenesis. 
2 MODEL OF LGN MORPHOGENESIS 
We will consider only the upper four (parvocellular) layers since the laminar tran- 
sition does not involve the other two layers. This transition results simply from a 
reordering of the four parvocellular strata (Figure 1). Foveal to the gaps, the strata 
form four morphologically distinct layers (6, 5, 4 and 3) because adjacent strata 
receive inputs from opposite eyes, which repel one another. Peripheral to the 
gaps, the reordering of strata reduces the number of parvocellular eye alternations 
to one, resulting in two parvocellular layers (6+4 and 5+3). 
2.1 GEOMETRY AND VARIABLES 
LGN cells ci are labeled by indices i - 1,2,... ,N. The cells have fixed, 
quazi-random and uniformly distributed locations ri  V C 3, where 
V = { (x,y,z)I0 < x < Sz,O < y < Sy, O < z < Sz}, and belong to one projection 
column Cab, a = 1,2,...,A and b = 1,2,...,B, (Figure 3). Functional 
properties of the neurons change in time (denoted by ), and are described 
by eye specificity and receptive-field polarity, ei(), and pi(), respectively: 
ei('r),pi(-) e [--1,1] C R, i-1,2,...,N, -=O,l,...,Tmaz. 
The values of eye specificity and polarity represent the prop options of synapses from 
competing types of retinal ganglion cells (there are four type of ganglion cells -- 
from different eyes and with ON or OFF polarity). �i -- --1 (�i -- 1) denotes that 
the i-th cell is receiving input solely from the opposite (same side) retina. Similarly, 
pi = -1 (pi = 1) denotes that the cell input is pure ON (OFF) center. Intermediate 
values of �i and Pi imply that the cell does not have pure properties (it receives

input from retinal ganglion cells of both eyes and with different polarities). Initial- 
ly, at r = 0, all LGN cells are characterized by el, Pi = O. This corresponds to 
two possibilities: no retinal ganglion cells synapse on any LGN cell, or proportions 
of synapses from different ganglion cells on all LGN neurons are equal, i.e., neu- 
rons possess completely undetermined functionality because of competing inputs of 
equal strength. As the neurons mature and acquire functional properties, their eye 
specificity and polarity reach their asymptotic values, -I-1. 
Even when cells are not completely mature, we will refer to them as being of four 
different types, depending on the signs of their functional properties. Following 
accepted anatomical notation, we will label them as 6, 5, 4, and 3. We denote 
eye specificity of cell types 6 and 4 as negative, and cell types 5 and 3 as positive. 
Polarity of cell types 6 and 5 is negative, while polarity of types 4 and 3 is positive. 
Cell functional properties are subject to the dynamics described in the following 
section. The process of LGN development starts from its foveal part, since in the 
retina it is the fovea that matures first. As more peripheral parts of the retina 
mature, their ganglion cells start to compete to establish permanent synapses on 
LGN cells. In this sorting process, each LGN cell gradually emerges with permanent 
synapses that connect only to several neighboring ganglions of the same type. A 
wave of gradual development of functionality sweeps through the nucleus. The 
driving force for this maturation process is described by localized cell interactions 
modulated by external influences. The particular pattern of the foveal lamination 
is shaped by external forces, and later serves as a starting point for a propagation 
of sameness of cell properties. Such a sameness propagation produces clustering of 
similar cells and formation of layers. It should be stressed that cells do not move, 
only their characteristics change. 
2.2 DYNAMICS 
The variables describing cell functional properties are subject to the following dy- 
namics

In Eq. (1), there are two contributions to the change of the intermediate variables 
6i(r) and/Si(r). The first is deterministic, given by

The second is a stochastic contribution corresponding to fluctuations in the growth 
of the synapses between retinal ganglion cells and LGN neurons. This noise in 
synaptic growth plays both a driving and a stabilizing role to be explained below. 
We explain the meaning of the variables in Eq. (2) only for the eye specificity variable 
el. The corresponding parameters for polarity Pi have similar interpretations. 
The parameter c (ri) is the rate of cell development. This rate is the same for eye 
specificity and polarity. It depends on the position ri of the cell in order to allow 
for spatially non-uniform development. The functional form of c (ri) is given in the 
Appendix.
