Abstract 
In single cells of the cat striate cortex, lateral inhibition across orienta- 
tion and/or spatial frequency is found to enhance pre-existing biases. A 
contrast-dependent but spatially non-selective inhibitory component is also 
found. Stimulation with ascending and descending contrasts reveals the 
latter as a response hysteresis that is sensitive, powerful and rapid, sug- 
gesting that it is active in day-to-day vision. Both forms of inhibition are 
not recurrent but are rather network properties. These findings suggest 
two fundamental inhibitory mechanisms: a global mechanism that limits 
dynamic range and creates spatial selectivity through thresholding and a 
local mechanism that specifically refines spatial filter properties. Analysis 
of burst patterns in spike trains demonstrates that these two mechanisms 
have unique physiological origins.

INFORMATION PROCESSING IN STRIATE 
CORTICAL CELLS 
The most popular current model of single cells in the striate cortex casts them 
in terms of spatial and temporal filters. The input to visual cortical cells from 
lower visual areas, primarily the LGN, is fairly broadband (e.g., Soodak, Shapley & 
Kaplan, 1987; Maffei & Fiorentini, 1973). Cortical cells perform significant band- 
width restrictions on this information in at least three domains: orientation, spatial 
frequency and temporal frequency. The most interesting quality of these cells is 
76 Bonds 
therefore what they reject from the broadband input signal, rather than what they 
pass, since the mere passage of the signal adds no information. Visual cortical cells 
also show contrast-transfer, or amplitude-dependent, nonlinearities which are not 
seen at lower levels in the visual pathway. The primary focus of our lab is study of 
the cortical mechanisms that support both the band limitations and nonlinearities 
that are imposed on the relatively unsullied signals incoming from the LGN. All of 
our work is done on the cat.

THE ROLE OF INHIBITION IN ORIENTATION 
SELECTIVITY 
Orientation selectivity is one of the most dramatic demonstrations of the filtering 
ability of cortical cells. Cells in the LGN are only mildly biased for stimulus ori- 
entation, but cells in cortex are completely unresponsive to orthogonal stimuli and 
have tuning bandwidths that average only about 40-50 � (e.g., Rose  Blakemore, 
1974). How this happens remains controversial, but there is general consensus that 
inhibition helps to define orientation selectivity although the schemes vary. The 
concept of cross-orientation inhibition suggests that the inhibition is itself orienta- 
tion selective and tuned in a complimentary way to the excitatory tuning of the cell, 
being smallest at the optimal orientation and greatest at the orthogonal orientation. 
More recent results, including those from our own lab, suggests that this is not the 
case. 
We studied the orientation dependence of inhibition by presenting two superim- 
posed gratings, a base grating at the optimal orientation to provide a steady level 
of background response activity, and a mask grating of varying orientation which 
yielded either excitation or inhibition that could supplement or suppress the base- 
generated response. There is some confusion when both base and mask generate 
excitation. In order to separate the response components from each of these stimuli, 
the two gratings were drifted at differing temporal frequencies. At least in simple 
cells, the individual contributions to the response from each grating could then be 
resolved by performing Fourier analysis on the response histograms. 
Experiments were done on 52 cells, of which about 2/3 showed organized suppression 
from the mask grating (Bonds, 1989). Fig. i shows that while the mask-generated 
response suppression is somewhat orientation selective, it is by and large much flat- 
ter than would be required to account for the tuning of the cell. There is thus some 
orientation dependence of inhibition, but not specifically at the orthogonal orienta- 
tion as might be expected. Instead, the predominant component of the suppression 
is constant with mask orientation, or global. This suggests that virtually any 
stimulus can result in inhibition, whether or not the recorded cell actually sees 
it. What orientation-dependent component of inhibition that might appear is ex- 
pressed in suppressive side-bands near the limits of the excitatory tuning function, 
which have the effect of enhancing any pre-existing orientation bias. 
Thus the concept of cross-orientation inhibition is not particularly correct, since 
the inhibition is found not just at the cross orientation but rather at all orien- 
tations. Even without orientation-selective inhibition, a scheme for establishment 
of true orientation selectivity from orientation-biased LGN input can be derived

THE ROLE OF INHIBITION IN SPATIAL 
FREQUENCY SELECTIVITY 
While most retinal and LGN cells are broadly tuned and predominantly low-pass, 
cortical cells generally have spatial frequency bandpasses of about 1.5-2 octaves (e.g., 
Maffei k Fiorentini, 1973). We have examined the influence of inhibition on spatial 
frequency selectivity using the same strategy as the previous experiment (Bauman & 
Bonds, 1991). A base grating, at the optimal orientation and spatial frequency, drove 
the cell, and a superimposed mask grating, at the optimal orientation but at different 
spatial and temporal frequencies, provided response facilitation or suppression. 
We defined three broad categories of spatial frequency tuning functions: Low pass, 
with no discernible low-frequency fall-off, band-pass, with a peak between 0.4 and 
0.9 c/deg, and high pass, with a peak above i c/deg. About 75% of the cells 
showed response suppression organized with respect to the spatial frequency of 
mask gratings. For example, Fig. 2A shows a low-pass cells with high-frequency 
suppression and Fig. 2B shows a band-pass cell with mixed suppression, flanking 
the tuning curve at both low and high frequencies. In each case response suppression 
was graded with mask contrast and some suppression was found even at the optimal 
spatial frequency. Some cells showed no suppression, indicating that the suppression 
was not merely a stimulus artifact. In all but 2 of 42 cases, the suppression was 
appropriate to the enhancement of the tuning function (e.g., low-pass cells had high- 
frequency response suppression), suggesting that the design of the system is more 
78 Bonds 
than coincidental. No similar spatial-frequency-dependent suppression was found 
in LGN cells.

NON-STATIONARITY OF CONTRAST TRANSFER 
PROPERTIES 
The two experiments described above demonstrate the existence of intrinsic cortical 
mechanisms that refine the spatial filter properties of the cells. They also reveal a 
global form of inhibition that is spatially non-specific. Since it is found even with 
spatially optimal stimuli, it can influence the form of the cortical contrast-response 
function (usually measured with optimal stimuli). This function is essentially loga- 
rithmic, with saturation or even super-saturation at higher contrasts (e.g., Albrecht 
& Hamilton, 1982), as opposed to the more linear response behavior seen in cells 
earlier in the visual pathway. Cortical cells also show some degree of contrast adap- 
tation; when exposed to high mean contrasts for long periods of time, the response 
vs contrast curves move rightward (e.g., Ohzawa, Sclar& Freeman, 1985). We 
addressed the question of whether contrast-response nonlinearity and adaptation 
might be causally related. 
In order to compensate for intrinsic response variability in visual cortical cells, 
experimental stimulation has historically involved presentation of randomized se- 
quences of pattern parameters, the so-called multiple histogram technique (Henry, 
Bishop, Tupper  Dreher, 1973). Scrambling presentation order distributes time- 
dependent response variability across all stimulus conditions, but this procedure can 
be self-defeating by masking any stimulus-dependent response variation. We there- 
fore presented cortical cells with ordered sequences of contrasts, first ascending then 
descending in a stepwise manner (Bonds, 1991). This revealed a clear and powerful 
response hysteresis. Fig. 3A shows a solid line representing the contrast-response
