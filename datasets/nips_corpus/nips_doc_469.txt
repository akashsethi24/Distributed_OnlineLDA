Abstract 
Networks for reconstructing a sparse or noisy function often use an edge 
field to segment the function into homogeneous regions, This approach 
assumes that these regions do not overlap or have disjoint parts, which is 
often false. For example, images which contain regions split by an occlud- 
ing object can't be properly reconstructed using this type of network. We 
have developed a network that overcomes these limitations, using support 
maps to represent the segmentation of a signal. In our approach, the sup- 
port of each region in the signal is explicitly represented. Results from 
an initial implementation demonstrate that this method can reconstruct 
images and motion sequences which contain complicated occlusion. 
Introduction 
The task of efficiently approximating a function is central to the solution of many 
important problems in perception and cognition. Many vision algorithms, for in- 
stance, integrate depth or other scene attributes into a dense map useful for robotic 
tasks such as grasping and collision avoidance. Similarly, learning and memory are 
often posed as a problem of generalizing from stored observations to predict future 
behavior, and are solved by interpolating a surface through the observations in an 
appropriate abstract space. Many control and planning problems can also be solved 
by finding an optimal trajectory given certain control points and optimization con- 
straints.

In general, of course, finding solutions to these approximation problems is an ill- 
posed problem, and no exact answer can be found without the application of some 
prior knowledge or assumptions. Typically, one assumes the surface to be fit is either 
locally smooth or has some particular parametric form or basis function description. 
Many successful systems have been built to solve such problems in the cases where 
these assumptions are valid. However in a wide range of interesting cases where 
there is no single global model or universal smoothness constraint, such systems 
have difficulty. These cases typically involve the approximation or estimation of 
a heterogeneous function whose typical local structure is known, but which also 
includes an unknown number of abrupt changes or discontinuities in shape. 
2 Approximation of Heterogeneous Functions 
In order to accurately approximate a heterogeneous function with a minimum num- 
ber of parameters or interpolation units, it is necessary to divide the function into 
homogeneous chunks which can be approximated parsimoniously. When there is 
more than one homogeneous chunk in the signal/function, the data must be seg- 
mented so that observations of one object do not intermingle with and corrupt the 
approximation of another region. 
One simple approach is to estimate an edge map to denote the boundaries of ho- 
mogeneous regions in the function, and then to regularize the function within such 
boundaries. This method was formalized by Geman and Geman (1984), who de- 
veloped the line-process to insert discontinuities in a regularization network. A 
regularized solution can be efficiently computed by a neural network, either using 
discrete computational elements or analog circuitry (Poggio et al. 1985; Terzopou- 
los 1988). In this context, the line-process can be thought of as an array of switches 
placed between interpolation nodes (Figure la). As the regularization proceeds in 
this type of network, the switches of the line process open and prevent smoothing 
across suspected discontinuities. Essentially, these switches are opened when the 
squared difference between neighboring interpolated values exceeds some thresh- 
old (Blake and Zisserman 1987; Geiger and Girosi 1991). In practice a continuation 
method is used to avoid problems with local minima, and a continuous non-linearity 
is used in place of a boolean discontinuity. The term resistive fuse is often used 
to describe these connections between interpolation sites (Harris et al. 1990). 
3 Limitations of Edge-based Segmentation 
An edge-based representation assumes that homogeneous chunks of a function are 
completely connected, and have no disjoint subregions. For the visual reconstruction 
task, this implies that the projection of an object onto the image plane will always 
yield a single connected region. While this may be a reasonable assumption for 
certain classes of synthetic images, it is not valid for realistic natural images which 
contain occlusion and/or transparent phenomena. 
While a human observer can integrate over gaps in a region split by occlusion, the 
line process will prevent any such smoothing, no matter how close the subregions 
are in the image plane. When these disjoint regions are small (as when viewing 
an object through branches or leaves), the interpolated values provided by such a

network will not be reliable, since observation noise can not be averaged over a large 
number of samples. 
Similarly, an edge-based approach cannot account for the perception of motion 
transparency, since these stimuli have no coherent local neighborhoods. Human 
observers can easily interpolate 3-D surfaces in transparent random-dot motion 
displays (Husain et al. 1989). In this type of display, points only last a few frames, 
and points from different surfaces are transparently intermingled. With a line- 
process, no smoothing or integration would be possible, since neighboring points 
in the image belong to different 3-D surfaces. To represent and process images 
containing this kind of transparent phenomena, we need a framework that does not 
rely on a global 2D edge map to make segmentation decisions. By generalizing 
the regularization/surface interpolation paradigm to use support maps rather than 
a line-process, we can overcome limitations the discontinuity approach has with 
respect to transparency. 
4 Using Support Maps for Segmentation 
Our approach decomposes a heterogeneous function into a set of individual approx- 
imations corresponding to the homogeneous regions of the function. Each approx- 
imation covers a specific region, and ues a support map to indicate which points 
belong to that region. Unlike an edge-based representation, the support of an ap- 
proximation need not be a connected region -- in fact, the support can consist of a 
scattered collection of independent points! 
Against Edges: Function Approximation with Multiple Support Maps 391 
For a single approximation, it is relatively straight-forward to compute a support 
map. Given an approximation, we can find the support it has in the function by 
thresholding the residual error of that approximation. In terms of analog regular- 
ization, the support map (or support process can be implemented by placing a 
resistive fuse between the data and the interpolating units (Figure lb). 
A single support map is limited in usefulness, since only one region can be approxi- 
mated. In fact, it reduces to the outlier rejection paradigm of certain robust esti- 
mation methods, which are known to have severe theoretical limits on the amount 
of outlier contamination they can handle (Meet et al. 1991; Li 1985). To represent 
true heterogeneous stimuli, multiple support maps are needed, with one support 
map corresponding to each homogeneous (but not necessarily connected) region. 
We have developed a method to estimate a set of these support maps, based on find- 
ing a minimal length description of the function. We adopt a three-step approach: 
first, we generate a set of candidate support maps using simple thresholding tech- 
niques. Second, we find the subset of these maps which minimally describes the 
function, using a network optimization to find the smallest set of maps that covers 
all the observations. Finally, we re-allocate the support in this subset, such that 
only the approximation with the lowest residual error supports a particular point. 
4.1 Estimating Initial Support Fields 
Ideally, we would like to consider all possible support patterns of a given dimension 
as candidate support maps. Unfortunately, the combinatorics of the problem makes 
this impossible; instead, we attempt to find a manageable number of initial maps 
which will serve as a useful starting point. 
A set of candidate approximations can be obtained in many ways. In our work we 
have initialized their surfaces either using a table of typical values or by fitting a 
small fixed regions of the function. We denote each approximation of a homogeneous 
region as a tuple, (ai,,t,F/), where g/ = {sii} is a support map, t = {uii} is 
the approximated surface, and /= {rij } is the residual error computed by taking 
the difference of t with the observed data. (The scalar ai is used in deciding 
which subset of approximations are used in the final representation.) The support 
fields are set by thresholding the residual field based on our expected (or assumed) 
observation variance 8.

Perhaps the most critical problem in recovering a good heterogeneous description 
is estimating how many regions are in the function. Our approach to this problem
