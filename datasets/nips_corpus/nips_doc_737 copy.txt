Abstract 
A simple model of coupled dynamics of fast neurons and slow inter- 
actions, modelling self-organization in recurrent neural networks, 
leads naturally to an effective statistical mechanics characterized 
by a partition function which is an average over a replicated system. 
This is reminiscent of the replica trick used to study spin-glasses, 
but with the difference that the number of replicas has a physi- 
cal meaning as the ratio of two temperatures and can be varied 
throughout the whole range of real values. The model has inter- 
esting phase consequences as a function of varying this ratio and 
external stilnuli, and can be extended to a range of other models.

A SIMPLE MODEL WITH FAST DYNAMIC 
NEURONS AND SLOW DYNAMIC INTERACTIONS 
As the basic archetypal model we consider a system of Ising spin neurons rri C 
{-1, 1}, i C {1,..., N}, interacting via continuous-valued symmetric interactions, 
Jij, which themselves evolve in response to the states of the neurons. The neurons 
are taken to have a stochastic field-alignment dynamics which is fast compared with 
the evolution rate of the interactions Jij, such that on the time-scale of Jij-dynamics 
the neurons are effectively in equilibrium according to a Boltzmann distribution,

where 
- (2) 
<j 
and the subscript {Ji} indicates that the {Jj} are to be considered as quenched 
variables. In practice, several specific types of dynamics which obey detailed balance 
lead to the equilibrium distribution (1), such as a Markov process with single-spin 
flip Glauber dynamics [1]. The quantity  is an inverse temperature characterizing 
the stochastic gain. 
For the Jij dynamics we choose the form 
d 1 1 
rJij = {aiaj}{ao} - yJij + ?ij(t) (i < j) (3) 
where {..-){ao} refers to a thermodynamic average over the distribution (1) with 
the effectively instantaneous {Jj}, and ?j(t) is a stochastic Gaussian white noise 
of zero mean and correlation 
(rlij(t)rlkt(t')} - 2r/-l S(ij),(kl)5(t - t') 
The first term on the right-hand side of (3) is inspired by the Hebbian process in 
neural tissue in which synaptic efficacies are believed to grow locally in response to 
the simultaneous activity of pre- and post-synaptic neurons [2]. The second term 
acts to limit the magnitude of Zij; / is the characteristic inverse temperature of 
the interaction system. (A related interaction dynamics without the noise term, 
equivalent to/ = c, was introduced by Shinomoto [3]; the anti-Hebbian version of 
the above coupled dynamics was studied in layered systems by Jonker et al. [4, 5].) 
Substituting for Io'io'j) in terms of the distribution (1) enables us to re-write (3) as 
d c 
NrJii = -c2Ji-'7/ ( {Jii)) + x/rlii(t) (4) 
where the effective Hamiltonian 7/({Ji}) is given by 
1 N

where Z ({Jij}) is the partition function associated with (2): 
({Jij})= Tr exp .

2 COUPLED SYSTEM IN THERMAL EQUILIBRIUM 
We now recognise (4) as having the form of a Langevin equation, so that the equilib- 
rium distribution of the interaction system is given by a Boltzmann form. Hence- 
forth, we concentrate on this equilibrium state which we can characterize by a 
partition function  and an associated 'free energy' /:

where n --//. We may use  as a generating functional to produce thermody- 
namic averages of state variables (I> ({rri}; {Jq}) in the combined system by adding 
suitable infinitesimal source terms to the neuron Itamiltonian (2):

-- (7) 
where the bar refers to an average over the asymptotic {Jij) dynamics. 
The form (6) with n - 0 is immediately reminiscent of the effective partition 
function which results from the application of the replica trick to replace In Z by 
lim,_0 (Z ' - 1) in dealing with a quenched average for the infinite-ranged spin- 
glass [6], while n = i relates to the corresponding annealed average, although we 
note that in the present model the time-scales for neuron and interaction dynamics 
remain completely disparate. These observations correlate with the identification 
of n with//3, which implies that n - 0 corresponds to a situation in which the 
interaction dynamics is dominated by the stochastic term rli j (t), rather than by the 
behaviour of the neurons, while for n - i the two characteristic temperatures are 
the same. For n - oe the influence of the neurons on the interaction dynamics 
dominates. In fact, any real n is possible by tuning the ratio between the two fi's. 
In the formulation presented in this paper n is always non-negative, but negative 
values are possible if the Itebbian rule of (3) is replaced by an anti-Itebbian form 
with (rrrrj) replaced by -(rrirrj) (the case of negative n is being studied by Mzard 
and co-workers [7]). 
The model discussed above is range-free/infinite-ranged and can therefore be an- 
alyzed in the thermodynamic limit N  oc by the replica mean-field theory as 
devised for the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin-glass [6, 8, 9]. This can be developed 
precisely for integer n [6, 8, 9, 10] and analytically continued. In the usual manner 
there enters a spin-glass order parameter 
where the superscripts are replica labels. qV* is given by the extremum of 
F({qV*}): 2fi_rt2 y [qV*] 2 +in Tr exp 
while 2 is proportional to exp [NextrF ({qV*})]. In the replica-symmetric region 
(or ansatz) one assumes qV* = q. 
We will first choose as the independent variables n and/ and briefly discuss the 
phase picture of our model (full details can be found in [11]). The system exhibits 
a transition from a paramagnetic state (q = 0) to an ordered state (q > 0) at a 
critical/(n). For n _< 2 this transition is second order at/ = 1, down to the SK 
450 Coolen, Penney, and Sherrington 
spin-glass limit, n - 0, but for n > 2 the coupled dynamics leads to a qualitative, 
as well as quantitative, change to first order. Replica symmetry is stable above a 
critical value no(/3), at which there is a de Almeida-Thouless (AT) transition (c.f. 
Kondor [12]). As expected from spin-glass studies, no(/3) goes to zero as /3  1 
but rises for larger /7, having a maximum of order 0.3 at /3 of order 2. Thus, for 
n > n(max) m 0.3 there is no instability against small replica-symmetry breaking 
fluctuations, while for smaller n there is re-entrance in this stability. The transition 
from a paramagnetic to an ordered state and the onset of local RS instability for 
various temperatures is shown in Figure 1. 
3 EXTERNAL FIELDS 
Several simple modifications of the above model are possible. One consists of adding 
external fields to the spin dynamics and/or to the interaction dynamics, by making 
the substitutions 
in (2) and (5) respectively. These external fields may be viewed as generating fields 
in the sense of (7); for example 
Ob:ij - Jij OKijOKkt -/3 [JijJk - Jij 
For neural network models a natural first choice for the external fields would be 
Oi  hi and Kij -- Kij, i  {-1, 1}, where the i are quenched random vari- 
ables corresponding to an imposed pattern. Without loss of generality all the i 
can be taken as +1, via the gauge transformation o'i  o'ii, Jij  Jijij. Hence- 
forth we shall make this choice. The neuron perturbation field h induces a finite 
'magnetization' characterized by a new order parameter 
which is independent of a in the replica-symmetric assumption (which turns out 
to be stable with respect to variation in this parameter). As in the case of the 
spin-glass, there is now a critical surface in (h, n,/3) space characterizing the onset 
of replica symmetry breaking. In introducing the interaction perturbation field K 
we find that K/lu is the analogue of the mean exchange J0 in the SK spin-glass 
model, f2 -- (/3nit) -t being the analogue of the variance. If large enough, this field 
leads to a spontaneous 'ferromagnetic' order. 
Again we find further examples of both second and first order transitions (details 
can be found in [11]). For the paramagnetic (P; m = 0, q = 0) to ferromagnetic 
(F; m  0, q  0) case, the transition is second order at the SK value fiJ0 = 1 so 
long as (/3f)-2 _> 3n - 2. Only when (/3f)-2 < 3n - 2 do the interaction dynamics

influence the transition, changing it to first order at a lower temperature. Regarding 
the ferromagnetic to spin-glass (SG; m = 0, q  0) transition, this exhibits both 
second order (lower Jo) and first order (higher J0) sections separated by a tricritical 
point for n less than a critical value of the order of 3.3. This tricritical point exhibits 
re-entrance as a function of n.
