Abstract 
The technique of principal component analysis (PCA) has recently been 
expressed as the maximum likelihood solution for a generative latent 
variable model. In this paper we use this probabilistic reformulation 
as the basis for a Bayesian treatment of PCA. Our key result is that ef- 
fective dimensionality of the latent space (equivalent to the number of 
retained principal components) can be determined automatically as part 
of the Bayesian inference procedure. An important application of this 
framework is to mixtures of probabilistic PCA models, in which each 
component can determine its own effective complexity. 
1 Introduction 
Principal component analysis (PCA) is a widely used technique for data analysis. Recently 
Tipping and Bishop (1997b) showed that a specific form of generative latent variable model 
has the property that its maximum likelihood solution extracts the principal sub-space of 
the observed data set. This probabilistic reformulation of PCA permits many extensions 
including a principled formulation of mixtures of principal component analyzers, as dis- 
cussed by Tipping and Bishop (1997a). 
A central issue in maximum likelihood (as well as conventional) PCA is the choice of 
the number of principal components to be retained. This is particularly problematic in a 
mixture modelling context since ideally we would like the components to have potentially 
different dimensionalities. However, an exhaustive search over the choice of dimensionality 
for each of the components in a mixture distribution can quickly become computationally 
intractable. In this paper we develop a Bayesian treatment of PCA, and we show how this 
leads to an automatic selection of the appropriate model dimensionality. Our approach 
avoids a discrete model search, involving instead the use of continuous hyper-parameters 
to determine an effective number of principal components.

2 Maximum Likelihood PCA 
Consider a data set D of observed d-dimensional vectors D = {t,} where n E 
{1,... , N}. Conventional principal component analysis is obtained by first computing 
the sample covariance matrix given by 
N 
S= Z(t.--)(t.--)T 
(1) 
where [ = N - 5-, t, is the sample mean. Next the eigenvectors ui and eigenvalues hi 
of $ are found, where Sui = Aiui and i = 1,... , d. The eigenvectors corresponding 
to the q largest eigenvalues (where q < d) are retained, and a reduced-dimensionality 
representation of the data set is defined by x, = uT(tn -- ) where Uq = (u,... , Uq). 
It is easily shown that PCA corresponds to the linear projection of a data set under which 
the retained variance is a maximum, or equivalently the linear projection for which the 
sum-of-squares reconstruction cost is minimized. 
A significant limitation of conventional PCA is that it does not define a probability distri- 
bution. Recently, however, Tipping and Bishop (1997b) showed how PCA can be reformu- 
lated as the maximum likelihood solution of a specific latent variable model, as follows. 
We first introduce a q-dimensional latent variable x whose prior distribution is a zero mean 
Gaussian p(x) = Af(0, Iq) and Iq is the q-dimensional unit matrix. The observed variable t 
is then defined as a linear transformation ofx with additive Gaussian noise t = Wx+/x+e 
where W is a d x q matrix,/x is a d-dimensional vector and e is a zero-mean Gaussian- 
distributed vector with covariance cr2It. Thus p(tlx) = A;(Wx + t, cr2It) ï¿½ The marginal 
distribution of the observed variable is then given by the convolution of two Gaussians and 
is itself Gaussian 
p(t):/p(tlx)p(x)dx = C) 
(2) 
where the covariance matrix C = WW T + cr2Lt. The model (2) represents a constrained 
Gaussian distribution governed by the parameters/x, W and o '2. 
The log probability of the parameters under the observed data set D is then given by 
L(kt, W, cr 2) - 
N {dln(27r) + lnlC I + Tr [C-S] } (3) 
2 
where $ is the sample covariance matrix given by (1). The maximum likelihood solution 
for/x is easily seen to be/XML -- . It was shown by Tipping and Bishop (1997b) that the 
stationary points of the log likelihood with respect to W satisfy 
WML -- Uq(Aq - 0'2Iq) 1/2 
(4) 
where the columns of Uq are eigenvectors of $, with corresponding eigenvalues in the 
diagonal matrix Aq. It was also shown that the maximum of the likelihood is achieved when 
the q largest eigenvalues are chosen, so that the columns of Uq correspond to the principal 
eigenvectors, with all other choices of eigenvalues corresponding to saddle points. The 
maximum likelihood solution for o '2 is then given by 
d 
O'IL - d - q i=q+l 
(5) 
which has a natural interpretation as the average variance lost per discarded dimension. The 
density model (2) thus represents a probabilistic formulation of PCA. It is easily verified 
that conventional PCA is recovered in the limit o '2 --+ 0.

Probabilistic PCA has been successfully applied to problems in data compression, density 
estimation and data visualization, and has been extended to mixture and hierarchical mix- 
ture models. As with conventional PCA, however, the model itself provides no mechanism 
for determining the value of the latent-space dimensionality q. For q = d - 1 the model 
is equivalent to a full-covariance Gaussian distribution, while for q < d - 1 it represents 
a constrained Gaussian in which the variance in the remaining d - q directions is mod- 
elled by the single parameter cr 2. Thus the choice of q corresponds to a problem in model 
complexity optimization. If data is plentiful, then cross-validation to compare all possible 
values of q offers a possible approach. However, this can quickly become intractable for 
mixtures of probabilistic PCA models if we wish to allow each component to have its own 
q value. 
3 Bayesian PCA 
The issue of model complexity can be handled naturally within a Bayesian paradigm. 
Armed with the probabilistic reformulation of PCA defined in Section 2, a Bayesian treat- 
ment of PCA is obtained by first introducing a prior distribution p(tt, W, cr 2) over the 
parameters of the model. The corresponding posterior distribution p(tt, W, o '2 I D) is then 
obtained by multiplying the prior by the likelihood function, whose logarithm is given by 
(3), and normalizing. Finally, the predictive density is obtained by marginalizing over the 
parameters, so that 
p(tlD ):///p(t I/, W, a2)P(/, W, cr21D) dl der 2. 
(6) 
In order to implement this framework we must address two issues: (i) the choice of prior 
distribution, and (ii) the formulation of a tractable algorithm. Our focus in this paper is on 
the specific issue of controlling the effective dimensionality of the latent space (correspond- 
ing to the number of retained principal components). Furthermore, we seek to avoid dis- 
crete model selection and instead use continuous hyper-parameters to determine automat- 
ically an appropriate effective dimensionality for the latent space as part of the process of 
Bayesian inference. This is achieved by introducing a hierarchical prior p(Wlc) over the 
matrix W, governed by a q-dimensional vector of hyper-parameters c = {c,... , Cq }. 
The dimensionality of the latent space is set to its maximum possible value q = d - 1, and 
each hyper-parameter controls one of the columns of the matrix W through a conditional 
Gaussian distribution of the form 
P(WIc): H \-] exp -11will 2 
i=1 
(7) 
where {wi} are the columns of W. This form of prior is motivated by the framework 
of automatic relevance determination (ARD) introduced in the context of neural networks 
by Neal and MacKay (see MacKay, 1995). Each ci controls the inverse variance of the 
corresponding wi, so that if a particular ci has a posterior distribution concentrated at 
large values, the corresponding wi will tend to be small, and that direction in latent space 
will be effectively 'switched off'. The probabilistic structure of the model is displayed 
graphically in Figure 1. 
In order to make use of this model in practice we must be able to marginalize over the 
posterior distribution of W. Since this is analytically intractable we have developed three 
alternative approaches based on (i) type-II maximum likelihood using a local Gaussian 
approximation to a mode of the posterior distribution (MacKay, 1995), (ii) Markov chain 
Monte Carlo using Gibbs sampling, and (iii) variational inference using a factorized ap- 
proximation to the posterior distribution. Here we describe the first of these in more detail.

where L is given by (3). For the purpose of controlling the effective dimensionality of 
the latent space, it is sufficient to treat/, o '2 and c as parameters whose values are to 
be estimated, rather than as random variables. In this case there is no need to introduce 
priors over these variables, and we can determine/ and 0 '2 by maximum likelihood. To 
estimate c we use type-II maximum likelihood, corresponding to maximizing the marginal 
likelihood p(DIc) in which we have integrated over W using the quadratic approximation. 
It is easily shown (Bishop, 1995) that this leads to a re-estimation formula for the hyper- 
parameters ai of the form
