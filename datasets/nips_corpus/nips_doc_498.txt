Abstract 
Visual object recognition involves the identification of images of 3-D ob- 
jects seen from arbitrary viewpoints. We suggest an approach to object 
recognition in which a view is represented as a collection of points given 
by their location in the image. An object is modeled by a set of 2-D views 
together with the correspondence between the views. We show that any 
novel view of the object can be expressed as a linear combination of the 
stored views. Consequently, we build a linear operator that distinguishes 
between views of a specific object and views of other objects. This opera- 
tor can be implemented using neural network architectures with relatively 
simple structures. 
1 Introduction 
Visual object recognition involves the identification of images of 3-D objects seen 
from arbitrary viewpoints. In particular, objects often appear in images from previ- 
ously unseen viewpoints. In this paper we suggest an approach to object recognition 
in which rigid objects are recognized from arbitrary viewpoint. The method can be 
implemented using neural network architectures with relatively simple structures. 
In our approach a view is represented as a collection of points given by their loca- 
tion in the image, An object is modeled by a small set of views together with the 
correspondence between these views. We show that any novel view of the object

can be expressed as a linear combination of the stored views. Consequently, we 
build a linear operator that distinguishes views of a specific object from views of 
other objects. This operator can be implemented by a neural network. 
The method has several advantages. First, it handles correctly rigid objects, but is 
not restricted to such objects. Second, there is no need in this scheme to explicitly 
recover and represent the 3-D structure of objects. Third, the computations involved 
are often simpler than in previous schemes. 
2 Previous Approaches 
Object recognition involves a comparison of a viewed image against object models 
stored in memory. Many existing schemes to object recognition accomplish this task 
by performing a template comparison between the image and each of the models, 
often after compensating for certain variations due to the different positions and 
orientations in which the object is observed. Such an approach is called alignment 
(Ullman, 1989), and a similar approach is used in (Fischler & Bolles 1981, Lowe 
1985, Faugeras & Hebert 1986, Chien & Aggarwal 1987, Huttenlocher & Ullman 
1987, Thompson &; Mundy 1987). 
The majority of alignment schemes use object-centered representations to model the 
objects. In these models the 3-D structure of the objects is explicitly represented. 
The acquisition of models in these schemes therefore requires a separate process to 
recover the 3-D structure of the objects. 
A number of recent studies use 2-D viewer-centered representations for object recog- 
nition. Abu-Mostafa & Pslatis (1987), for instance, developed a neural network that 
continuously collects and stores the observed views of objects. When a new view 
is observed it is recognized if it is sufficiently similar to one of the previously seen 
views. The system is very limited in its ability to recognize objects from novel 
views. It does not use information available from a collection of object views to 
extend the range of recognizable views beyond the range determined by each of the 
stored views separately. 
In the scheme below we suggest a different kind of viewer-centered representations 
to model the objects. An object is modeled by a set of its observed images with the 
correspondence between points in the images. We show that only a small number 
of images is required to predict the appearance of the object from all possible 
viewpoints. These predictions are exact for rigid objects, but are not confined to 
such objects. We also suggest a neural network to implement the scheme. 
A similar representation was recently used by Poggio & Edelman (1990) to develop a 
network that recognizes objects using radial basis functions (RBFs). The approach 
presented here has several advantages over this approach. First, by using the linear 
combinations of the stored views rather than applying radial basis functions to 
them we obtain exact predictions for the novel appearances of objects rather than 
an approximation. Moreover, a smaller number of views is required in our scheme to 
predict the appearance of objects from all possible views. For example, when a rigid 
object that does not introduce self occlusion (such as a wired object) is considered, 
predicting its appearance from all possible views requires only three views under 
the LC Scheme and about sixty views under the RBFs Scheme.

3 The Linear Combinations (LC) Scheme 
In this section we introduce the Linear Combinations (LC) Scheme. Additional 
details about the scheme can be found in (Ullman & Basri, 1991). Our approach is 
based on the following observation. For many continuous transformations of interest 
in recognition, such as 3-D rotation, translation, and scaling, every possible view 
of a transforming object can be expressed as a linear combination of other views of 
the object. In other words, the set of possible images of an object undergoing rigid 
3-D transformations and scaling is embedded in a linear space, spanned by a small 
number of 2-D images. 
We start by showing that any image of an object undergoing rigid transformations 
followed by an orthographic projection can be expressed as a linear combination of 
a small number of views. The coefficients of this combination may differ for the z- 
and y-coordinates. That is, the intermediate view of the object may be given by two 
linear combinations, one for the z-coordinates and the other for the y-coordinates. 
In addition, certain functional restrictions may hold among the different coefficients. 
We represent an image by two coordinate vectors, one contains the z-values of the 
object's points, and the other contains their y-values. In other words, an image P 
is described by x = (z,...,Xn) and y = (Y,..-, Yn) where every (xi,Yi), 1 < i < n, 
is an image point. The order of the points in these vectors is preserved in all the 
different views of the same object, namely, if P and pt are two views of the same 
object, then (xi,yi)  P and (zti,y)  pt are in correspondence (or, in other words, 
they are the projections of the same object point). 
Claim: The set of coordinate vectors of an object obtained from all different 
viewpoints is embedded in a 4-D linear space. 
(A proof is given in Appendix A.) 
Following this claim we can represent the entire space of views of an object by a 
basis that consists of any four linearly independent vectors taken from the space. 
In particular, we can construct a basis using familiar views of the object. Two 
images supply four such vectors and therefore are often sufficient to span the space. 
By considering the linear combinations of the model vectors we can reproduce any 
possible view of the object. 
It is important to note that the set of views of a rigid object does not occupy the 
entire linear 4-D space. Rather, the coefficients of the linear combinations repro- 
ducing valid images follow in addition two quadratic constraints. (See Appendix 
A.) In order to verify that an object undergoes a rigid transformation (as opposed 
to a general 3-D affine transformation) the model must consist of at least three 
snapshots of the object. 
Many 3-D rigid objects are bounded with smooth curved surfaces. The contours of 
such objects change their position on the object whenever the viewing position is 
changed. The linear combinations scheme can be extended to handle these objects 
as well. In this cases the scheme gives accurate approximations to the appearance 
of these objects (Ullman L; Basri, 1991). 
The linear combination scheme assumes that the same object points are visible in 
the different views. When the views are sufficiently different, this will no longer hold,

due to self-occlusion. To represent an object from all possible viewing directions 
(e.g., both 'front and back), a number of different models of this type will be 
required. This notion is similar to the use of different object aspects suggested by 
Koenderink gt Van Doom (1979). (Other aspects of occlusion are discussed in the 
next section.) 
4 Recognizing an Object Using the LC Scheme 
In the previous section we have shown that the set of views of a rigid object is 
embedded in a linear space of a small dimension. In this section we define a linear 
operator that uses this property to recognize objects. We then show how this 
operator can be used in the recognition process. 
Let p,...,pk be the model views, and p be a novel view of the same object. 
According to the previous section there exist coefficients a,...,ak such that: 
P = i=aiPi' Suppose L is a linear operator such that Lpi = q for every 
1 _ i _ n and some constant vector q, then L transforms p to q (up to a scale 
factor), Lp = (i= ai)q. If in addition L transforms vectors outside the space 
spanned by the model to vectors other then q then L distinguishes views of the 
object from views of other objects. The vector q then serves as a name for the 
object. It can either be the zero vector, in which case L transforms every novel view 
of the object to zero, or it can be a familiar view of the object, in which case L has 
an associative property, namely, it takes a novel view of an object and transforms 
it to a famili
