Abstract 
We investigate the short term dynamics of the recurrent competition and 
neural activity in the primary visual cortex in terms of information pro- 
cessing and in the context of orientation selectivity. We propose that af- 
ter stimulus onset, the strength of the recurrent excitation decreases due 
to fast synaptic depression. As a consequence, the network shifts from 
an initially highly nonlinear to a more linear operating regime. Sharp 
orientation tuning is established in the first highly competitive phase. In 
the second and less competitive phase, precise signaling of multiple ori- 
entations and long range modulation, e.g., by intra- and inter-areal con- 
nections becomes possible (surround effects). Thus the network first ex- 
tracts the salient features from the stimulus, and then starts to process 
the details. We show that this signal processing strategy is optimal if 
the neurons have limited bandwidth and their objective is to transmit the 
maximum amount of information in any time interval beginning with the 
stimulus onset. 
1 Introduction 
In the last four decades there has been a vivid and highly polarized discussion about the 
role of recurrent competition in the primary visual cortex (V1) (see [12] for review). The 
main question is whether the recurrent excitation sharpens a weakly orientation tuned feed- 
forward input, or the feed-forward input is already sharply tuned, hence the massive re- 
current circuitry has a different function. Strong cortical recurrency implements a highly 
nonlinear mapping of the feed-forward input, and obtains robust and sharply tuned corti- 
cal response even if only a weak or no feed-forward orientation bias is present [6, 11, 2]. 
However, such a competitive network in most cases fails to process multiple orientations 
within the classical receptive field and may signal spurious orientations [7]. This moti- 
vates the concept that the primary visual cortex maps an already sharply orientation tuned 
feed-forward input in a less competitive (more linear) fashion [9, 13]. 
Although these models for orientation selectivity in V1 vary on a wide scale, they have 
one common feature: each of them assumes that the synaptic strength is constant on the 
short time scale on which the network operates. Given the phenomenon of fast synaptic

dynamics this, however, does not need to be the case. Short term synaptic dynamics, e.g., 
of the recurrent excitatory synapses would allow a cortical network to operate in both-- 
competitive and linear--regimes. We will show below (Section 2) that such a dynamic 
cortical amplifier network can establish sharp contrast invariant orientation tuning from 
a broadly tuned feed-forward input, while it is still able to respond correctly to multiple 
orientations. 
We then show (Section 3) that decreasing the recurrent competition with time naturally fol- 
lows from functional considerations, i.e. from the requirement that the mutual information 
between stimuli and representations is maximal for any time interval beginning with stimu- 
lus onset. We consider a free-viewing scenario, where the cortical layer represents a series 
of static images that are flashed onto the retina for a fixation period (AT -- 200 - 300 ms) 
between saccades. We also assume that the spike count in increasing time windows after 
stimulus onset carries the information. The key observations are that the signal-to-noise 
ratio of the cortical representation increases with time (because more spikes are available) 
and that the optimal strength of the recurrent connections (w.r.t. information transfer) de- 
creases with the decreasing output noise. Consequently the model predicts that the infor- 
mation content per spike (or the SNR for afixed sliding time window) decreases with time 
for a flashed static stimulus in accordance with recent experimental studies. The neural 
system thus adapts to its own internal changes by modifying its coding strategy, a phe- 
nomenon which one may refer to as dynamic coding 
2 Cortical amplifier with fast synaptic plasticity 
To investigate our first hypothesis, we set up a model for an orientation-hypercolumn in 
the primary visual cortex with similar structure and parameters as in [7]. The important 
novel feature of our model is that fast synaptic depression is present at the recurrent ex- 
citatory connections. Neurons in the cortical layer receive orientation-tuned feed-forward 
input from the LGN and they are connected via a Mexican-hat shaped recurrent kernel in 
orientation space. In addition, the recurrent and feed-forward excitatory synapses exhibit 
fast depression due to the activity dependent depletion of the synaptic transmitter [1, 14]. 
We compare the response of the cortical amplifier models with and without fast synap- 
tic plasticity at the recurrent excitatory connections to single and multiple bars within the 
classical receptive field. 
The membrane potential V(O, t) of a cortical cell tuned to an orientation 0 decreases due 
to the leakage and the recurrent inhibition, and increases due to the recurrent excitation

citatory synaptic efficacy jexc is time dependent due to the fast synaptic depression, while 
the efficacy of inhibitory synapses jinh is assumed to be constant. The recurrent excitation 
is sharply tuned O'exc = 7.5 �, while the inhibition has broad tuning O'in h = 90 o . The map- 
ping from the membrane potential to firing rate is approximated by a linear function with 
a threshold at 0 (f(O) =/3max(0, V(O)),/3: 15Hz/mV). Gaussian-noise with variances

static recurrent synaptic strength (b), and a network with fast synaptic depression (c) if the

of 6 Hz and 1.6 Hz is added to the input intensities and to the output of cortical neurons. 
The orientation tuning curves of the feed-forward input I LaN are Gaussians (rrLaN = 18 �) 
resting on a strong additive orientation independent component which would correspond to 
a geniculo-cortical connectivity pattern with an approximate aspect ratio of 1:2. Both, the 
orientation dependent and independent components increase with contrast. Considering a 
free-viewing scenario where the environment is scanned by saccading around and fixating 
for short periods of 200 - 300 ms we model stationary stimuli present for 300 ms. The 
stimuli are one or more bars with different orientations. 
Feed-forward and recurrent excitatory synapses exhibit fast depression. Fast synaptic de- 
p_ression is modeled by the dynamics of the expected synaptic transmitter or resource 
R(t) for each synapse. The amount of the available transmitter decreases proportionally to 
the release probability p and to the presynaptic firing rate f, and it recovers exponentially

The change of the membrane potential on the postsynaptic cell at time t is proportional 
to the released transmitter pR(t). The excitatory connectivity strength between neurons 
tuned to orientations 0 and 0' is expressed as jxc (0, 0', t) = dmxPROo, (t). Similarly this 
applies to the feed-forward synapses. Fast synaptic plasticity at the feed-forward synapses 
has been investigated in more detail in previous studies [3, 4]. 
In the following, we compare the predictions of the cortical amplifier model with and with- 
out fast synaptic depression at the recurrent excitatory connections. In both cases fast 
synaptic depression is present at the feed-forward connections limiting the duration of the 
effective feed-forward input to 200 - 400 ms. Figure 1 shows the orientation tuning curves 
at different stimulus contrasts. The feed-forward input is noisy and broadly tuned (Fig. 
la). Both models exhibit contrast invariant tuning (Fig. lb, c). If fast synaptic depression 
is present at the recurrent excitation, the cortical network sharpens the broadly tuned feed- 
forward input in the initial response phase. Once sharply tuned input is established, the 
tuning width does not change, only the response amplitude decreases in time. 
The predictions of the two models differ substantially if multiple orientations are present 
(Fig. 2). At first, we test the cortical response to two bars separated by 60 o with differ- 
ent intensities (Figs. 2a, b). If the recurrent synaptic weights are static and strong enough
