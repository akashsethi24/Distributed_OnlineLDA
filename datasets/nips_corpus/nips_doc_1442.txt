Abstract 
The learning of many visual perceptual tasks has been shown to be 
specific to practiced stimuli, while new stimuli require re-learning 
from scratch. Here we demonstrate generalization using a novel 
paradigm in motion discrimination where learning has been previ- 
ously shown to be specific. We trained subjects to discriminate 
the directions of moving dots, and verified the previous results 
that learning does not transfer from the trained direction to a new 
one. However, by tracking the subjects' performance across time 
in the new direction, we found that their rate of learning doubled. 
Therefore, learning generalized in a task previously considered too 
difficult for generalization. We also replicated, in the second ex- 
periment, transfer following training with easy stimuli. 
The specificity of perceptual learning and the dichotomy between 
learning of easy vs. difficult tasks were hypothesized to involve 
different learning processes, operating at different visual cortical 
areas. Here we show how to interpret these results in terms of signal 
detection theory. With the assumption of limited computational 
resources, we obtain the observed phenomena -- direct transfer 
and change of learning rate -- for increasing levels of task'difficulty. 
It appears that human generalization concurs with the expected 
behavior of a generic discrimination system. 
I Introduction 
Learning in biological systems is of great importance. But while cognitive learning 
(or problem solving) is typically abrupt and generalizes to analogous problems, 
perceptual skills appear to be acquired gradually and specifically: Human subjects 
cannot generalize a perceptual discrimination skill to solve similar problems with 
different attributes. For example, in a visual discrimination task (Fig. 1), a subject 
who is trained to discriminate motion directions between 43 � and 47 � cannot use 
46 Z Liu and D. Weinshall 
this skill to discriminate 133 � from 137 � . Generalization has been found only when 
stimuli of different attributes are interleaved [7, 10], or when the task is easier [6, 1]. 
For example, a subject who is trained to discriminate 41 � from 49 � can later readily 
discriminate 131 � from 139 � [6]. The specificity of learning has been so far used to 
support the hypothesis that perceptual learning embodies neuronal modifications 
in the brain's stimulus-specific cortical areas (e.g., visual area MT) [9, 3, 2, 5, 8, 4]. 
In contrast to previous results of learning specificity, we show in two experiments in 
Section 2 that learning in motion discrimination generalizes in all cases where speci- 
ficity was thought to exist, although the mode of generalization varies. (1) When 
the task is difficult, it is direction specific in the traditional sense; but learning in 
a new direction accelerates. (2) When the task is easy, it generalizes to all direc- 
tions after training in only one direction. While (2) is consistent with the findings 
reported in [6, 1], (1) demonstrate that generalization is the rule, not an exception 
limited only to easy stimuli.

Figure 1: Schematic of one trial. Left: the stimulus was a random dot pattern viewed 
in a circular aperture, spanning 8 � of visual angle, moving in a given primary direction 
(denoted dir). The primary direction was chosen from 12 directions, separated by 30 �. 
Right: the direction of each of the two stimuli was randomly chosen from two candidate 
directions (dir 4- A/2). The subject judged whether the two stimuli moved in the same or 
different directions. Feedback was provided. 
The motion discrimination task is described in Fig. 1. In each trial, the subject 
was presented with two consecutive stimuli, each moving in one of two possible 
directions (randomly chosen from the two directions dir + A/2 and dir- A/2). The 
directional difference ]A I between the two stimuli was 8 � in the easy condition, and 
4 � in the difficult condition. The experiment was otherwise identical to that in [2] 
that used ]A I = 3 �, except that our stimuli were displayed on an SGI computer 
monitor. ]A I = 8 � was chosen as the easy condition because most subjects found it 
relatively easy to learn, yet still needed substantial training. 
2.1 A difficult task 
We trained subjects extensively in one primary direction with a difficult motion 
discrimination task (A - 4�), followed by extensive training in a second primary 
direction. The two primary directions were sufficiently different so direct trans- 
fer between them was not expected [2] (Fig. 2). Subjects' initial performance in 
both directions was comparable, replicating the classical result of stimulus specific 
learning (no direct transfer). However, all subjects took only half as many train- 
ing sessions to make the same improvement in the second direction. All subjects 
had extensive practice with the task prior to this experiment, thus the acceleration 
cannot be simply explained by familiarity. 
Mechanisms of Generalization in Perceptual Learning 4 7 
Our results show that although perceptual learning did not directly transfer in this 
difficult task, it did nevertheless generalize to the new direction. The generalization 
was manifested as 100% increase in the rate of learning in the second direction. It 
demonstrates that the generalization of learning, as manifested via direct transfer 
and via increase in learning rate, may be thought of as two extremes of a continuum 
of possibilities.

Figure 2: Subjects DJ and ZL needed 20 training sessions in the first direction, and nine in 
the second; subject ZJX needed seven training sessions in the first, and four in the second. 
The rate of learning (the amount of improvement per session) in the second direction is 
significantly greater than in the first (t(2) = 13.41,p < 0.003). 
2.2 An easy task 
We first measured the subjects' baseline performance in an easy task -- the dis- 
crimination of motion directions 8 � apart -- in 12 primary directions (64 trials 
each, randomly interleaved). We then trained four subjects in one oblique primary 
direction (chosen randomly and counter-balanced among subjects) for four sessions, 
each with 700 trials. Finally, we measured again the subjects' performance in all 
directions. Every subject improved in all directions (Fig. 3). The performance of 
seven control subjects was measured without intermediate training; two more con- 
trol subjects were added who were trained with similar motion stimuli but were 
asked to discriminate a brightness change instead. The control subjects improved 
as well, but significantly less (Ad' = 0.09 vs. 0.78, Fig. 3). 
Our results clearly show that training with an easy task in one direction leads to 
immediate improvement in other directions. Hence the learned skill generalized 
across motion directions. 
3 A computational model 
We will now adopt a general framework for the analysis of perceptual learning 
results, using the language of signal detection theory. Our model accounts for the 
results in this paper by employing the constraint of limited computational resources. 
The model's assumptions are as follows. 
1. In each trial, each of the two stimuli is represented by a population of measure- 
ments that encode all aspects of the stimulus, in particular, the output of localized 
direction detectors. The measurements are encoded as a vector. The decision as to 
whether the two stimuli are the same or not is determined by the difference of the 
two vectors. 
2. Each component of the input measurements is characterized by its sensitivity 
for the discrimination task, e.g., how well the two motion directions can be dis- 
criminated apart based on this component. The entire population itself is generally 
divided into two sets: informative -- measurements with significant sensitivity, and

uninformative -- measurements with null sensitivity. In addition, informative mea- 
surements may vary greatly in their individual sensitivity. When many have high 
sensitivity, the task is easy. When most have low sensitivity, the task is difficult. 
We assume that sensitivity changes from one primary direction to the next, but 
the population of informative measurements remains constant. For example, in our 
psychophysical task localized directional signals are likely to be in the informative 
set for any motion direction, though their individual sensitivity will vary based 
on specific motion directions. On the other hand, local speed signals are never 
informative and therefore always belong to the uninformative set.
