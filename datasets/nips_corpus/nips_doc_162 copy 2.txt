ABSTRACT 
The application of neural networks to the demodulation of 
spread-spectrum signals in a multiple-access environment is 
considered. This study is motivated in large part by the fact 
that, in a multiuser system, the conventional (matched fil- 
ter) receiver suffers severe performance degradation as the 
relative powers of the interfering signals become large (the 
near-far problem). Furthermore, the optimum receiver, 
which alleviates the near-far problem, is too complex to be 
of practical use. Receivers based on multi-layer percepttons 
are considered as a simple and robust alternative to the opti- 
mum solution. The optimum receiver is used to benchmark 
the performance of the neural net receiver; in particular, it is 
proven to be instrumental in identifying the decision regions 
of the neural networks. The back-propagation algorithm and 
a modified version of it are used to train the neural net. An 
importance sampling technique is introduced to reduce the 
number of simulations necessary to evaluate the performance 
of neural nets. In all examples considered the proposed neu- 
ral net receiver significantly outperforms the conventional 
receiver. 
INTRODUCTION 
In this paper we consider the problem of demodulating signals in a code-division 
multiple-access (CDMA) Gaussian channel. Multiple accessing in code domain is 
achieved by spreading the spectrum of the transmitted signals using preassigned 
code waveforms. The conventional method of demodulating a spread-spectrum sig- 
nal in a multiuser environment employs one filter matched to the desired signal. 
Since the conventional receiver ignores the presence of interfering signals it is reli- 
able only when there are few simultaneous transmissions. Furthermore, when the 
relative received power of the interfering signals become large (the near-far prob- 
lem), severe performance degradation of the system is observed even in situations 
with relatively low bandwidth efficiencies (defined as the ratio of the number of 
channel subscribers to the spread of the bandwidth) [Aazhang 87]. For this reason 
there has been an interest in designing optimum receivers for multi-user communica- 
tion systems [Verdu 86, Lupas 89, Poor 88]. The resulting optimum demodulators,

however, have a variable decoding delay with computational and storage complexity 
that depend exponentially on the number of active users. Unfortunately, this com- 
putational intensity is unacceptable in many applications. There is hence a need 
for near optimum receivers that are robust to near-far effects with a reasonable 
computational complexity to ensure their practical implementation. 
In this study, we introduce a class of neural net receivers that are based on mul- 
tilayer percepttons trained via the back-propagation algorithm. Neural net receivers 
are very attractive alternatives to the optimum and conventional receivers due to 
their highly parallel structures. As we will observe, the performance of the neural 
net receivers closely track that of the optimum receiver in all examples considered. 
SYSTEM DESCRIPTION 
In the multiple-access network of interest, transmitters are assumed to share a radio 
band in a combination of the time and code domain. One way of multiple accessing 
in the code domain is spread spectrum, which is a signaling scheme that uses a much 
wider bandwidth than necessary for a given data rate. Let us assume that in a given 
time interval there are K active transmitters in the network. In a simple setting, 
the k th active user, in a symbol interval, transmits a signal from a binary signal 
set derived from the set of code waveforms assigned to the corresponding user. The 
signal is time limited to the interval [0, T], where T is the symbol duration. 
In this paper we will concentrate on symbol-synchronous CDMA systems. Syn- 
chronous systems find applications in time slotted channels with the central (base) 
station transmitting to remote (mobile) terminals and also in relays between cen- 
tral stations. The synchronous problem will also be construed as providing us with 
a manageable setting to better understand the issues in the more difficult asyn- 
chronous situation. In a synchronous CDMA system, the users maintain time syn- 
chronism so that the relative time delays associated with all users are assumed to be 
zero. To illustrate the potentials of the proposed multiuser detector, we present the 
application to binary PSK direct-sequence signals in coherent systems. Therefore, 
the signal at a given receiver is the superposition of the K transmitted signals in 
additive channel noise (see [Aazhang 87, Lupas 89] and references within)

where P is the packet length, A is the signal amplitude, we is the carrier frequency, 
0 is the phase angle. The symbol b? )  {-1, +1} denotes the bit that the k th user is 
transmitting in the ita time interval. In this model, nt is the additive channel noise 
which is assumed to be a white Gaussian random process. The time-limited code 
waveform, denoted. by a (t), is derived from the spreading sequence assigned to the 
k t user. That is, a(t) = Y7  a)p(t- jT�) where p(t) is the unit rectangular 
pulse of duration T� and N is the length of the spreading sequence. One code

that T = NTe. In this system, spectrum efficiency is measured as the ratio of the 
number of channel users to the spread factor, KIN. 
In the next two sections, we first consider optimum synchronous demodulation of 
the multiuser spread-spectrum signal. Then, we introduce the application of neural 
networks to the multiuser detection problem. 
OPTIMUM RECEIVER 
Multiuser detection is an active research area with the objective of developing strate- 
gies for demodulation of information sent by several transmitters sharing a channel 
[Verdu 86, Poor 88, Varanasi 89, Lupas 89]. In these situations with two or more 
users of a multiple-access Gaussian channel, one filter matched to the desired signal 
is no longer optimum since the decision statistics are effected by the other signals 
(e.g., the statistics are disturbed by cross-correlations with the interfering signals). 
Employing conventional matched filters, because of its structural simplicity, may 
still be justified if the system is operating at a low bandwidth efficiency. However, 
as the number of users in the system with fixed bandwidth grows or as the rel- 
ative received powers of the interfering signals become large, severe performance 
degradation of the conventional matched filter is observed [Aazhang 87]. For direct- 
sequence spread-spectrum systems, optimum receivers obtained by Verdu and Poor 
require an extremely high degree of software complexity and storage, which may be 
unacceptable for most multiple-access systems [Verdu 86, Lupas 89]. Despite imple- 
mentation problems, studies on optimum demodulation illustrate that the effects of 
interfering signals in a CDMA system, in principle, can be neutralized. 
A complete study of the suboptimum neural net receiver requires a review 
of the maximum likelihood sequence detection formulation. Assuming that all 
possible information sequences are independent and equally likely, and defining 
b_ (i) = [b? ) b? ) b?]', it is easy to see that an cptimum decision on b (i) is a 
, ,'�', m 
one-shot decision in that it requires the observation of the received signal only in 
the i th time interval. Without loss of generality, we will therefore focus our attention 
on i = 0 and drop the time superscript and consider the demodulation of the vector 
of bits b_ with the observation of the received signal in the interval [0, T]. 
In a K-user Gaussian channel, the most likely information vector is chosen as 
that which maximizes the log of the likelihood function (see [Lupas 89]) 
b_.op  = arg max 2 (t)r(t)dt - [ bS(t)]2dt 
where S(t) = Aa(t) cos(wet + 0) is the modulating signal of the k th user. The 
optimum decision can also be written as 
b_.op  = arg max { 2y'b - bHb}, 
b_{_ i,.i_i}K -- --

where H is the K x K matrix of signal cross-correlations such that the (k, l) ta 
element is h,l =< S(t), Sl(t) >. The vector of sufficient statistics y consists of the

The maximization in (3) has been shown to be NP-complete [Lupas 89], i.e., no 
algorithm is known that can solve the maximization problem in polynomial time in 
K. This computational intensity is unacceptable in many applications. In the next 
section, we consider a suboptimum receiver that employs artificial neural networks 
for finding a solution to a maximization problem similar to (3). 
NEURAL NETWORK 
Until now the application of neural networks to multiple-access communications has 
not drawn much attention. In this study we employ neural networks for classifying 
different signals in synchronous additive Gaussian channels. We assume that the 
information bits of the first of the K signals is of interest, therefore, the phase 
angle of the desired signal is assumed to be zero (i.e., 01 = 0). Two configurations 
with multi-layer perceptrons and sigmoid nonlinearity are considered for multiuser 
detection of direct-sequence spread-spectrum signals. 
One structure is depicted in Figure 1.b where a layered network of percep- 
ttons processes the sufficient statistics (4) of the multi-user Gaussian channel. In 
this structure the first layer of the net (referred to a
