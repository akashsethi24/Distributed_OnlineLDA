Abstract 
We have a developed an analog VLSI system that models the coordina- 
tion of neurobiological segmental oscillators. We have implemented and 
tested a system that consists of a chain of eleven pattern generating cir- 
cuits that are synaptically coupled to their nearest neighbors. Each pat- 
tern generating circuit is implemented with two silicon Morris-Lecar 
neurons that are connected in a reciprocally inhibitory network. We dis- 
cuss the mechanisms of oscillations in the two-cell network and explore 
system behavior based on isotropic and anisotropic coupling, and fre- 
quency gradients along the chain of oscillators. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
In recent years, neuroscientists and modelers have made great strides towards illuminat- 
ing structure and computational properties in biological motor systems. For example, 
much progress has been made toward understanding the neural networks that elicit rhyth- 
mic motor behaviors, including leech heartbeat (Calabrese and De Schutter, 1992), crus- 
tacean stomatogastric mill (Selverston, 1989) and tritonia swimming (Getting, 1989). In 
particular, segmented locomotory systems, such as those that underlie swimming in the 
lamprey (Cohen and Kiemel, 1993, Sigvardt, 1993, Grillner et al, 1991) and in the leech 
(Friesen and Pearce, 1993), are interesting from an quantitative perspective. In these sys- 
tems, it is clear that coordinated motor behaviors are a result of complex interactions 
among membrane, synaptic, circuit, and system properties. However, because of the lack 
of sufficient neural underpinnings, a complete understanding of the computational princi- 
ples in these systems is still lacking. Abstracting the biophysical complexity by modeling 
segmented systems as coupled nonlinear oscillators is one approach that has provided 
much insight into the operation of these systems (Cohen et al, 1982). More specifically, 
this type of modeling work has illuminated computational properties that give rise to 
phase constancy, a motor behavior that is characterized by intersegmental phase lags that 
are maintained at constant values independent of swimming frequency. For example, it 
has been shown that frequency gradients and asymmetrical coupling play an important 
role in establishing phase lags of correct sign and amplitude (Kopell and Ermentrout, 
1988) as well as appropriate boundary conditions (Williams and Sigvardt, 1994). 
Although theoretical modeling has provided much insight into the operation of interseg-

mental systems, these models have limited capacity for incorporating biophysical proper- 
ties and complex interconnectivity. Software and/or hardware emulation provides the 
potential to add such complexity to system models. Additionally, the modularity and reg- 
ularity in the anatomical and computational structures of intersegmental systems facili- 
tate scalable representations. These factors make segmented systems particularly viable 
for modeling using neuromorphic analog very large-scale integrated (aVLSI) technology. 
In general, biological motor systems have a number of properties that make their real- 
time modeling using aVLSI circuits interesting and approachable. Like their sensory 
counterparts, they exhibit rich emergent properties that are generated by collective archi- 
tectures that are regular and modular. Additionally, the fact that motor processing is at the 
periphery of the nervous system makes the analysis of the system behavior accessible due 
to the fact that output of the system (embodied in the motor actions) is observable and 
facilitates functional analysis. 
The goals in this research are i) to study how the properties of individual neurons in a net- 
work affect the overall system behavior; (ii) to facilitate the validation of the principles 
underlying intersegmental coordination; and (iii) to develop a real-time, low power, 
motion control system. We want to exploit these principles and architectures both to 
improve our understanding of the biology and to design artificial systems that perform 
autonomously in various environments. In this paper we present an analog VLSI model of 
intersegmental coordination that addresses the role of frequency gradients and asymmet- 
rical coupling. Each segment in our system is implemented with two silicon model neu- 
rons that are connected in a reciprocally inhibitory network. A model of intersegmental 
coordination is implemented by connecting eleven such osciIlators, with nearest neigh- 
bor coupling. We present the neuron model, and we investigate the role of frequency gra- 
dients and asymmetrical coupling in the establishment of phase lags along a chain these 
neural oscillators. 
2 NEURON MODEL 
In order to produce bursting activity, a neuron must possess slow intrinsic time con- 
stants in addition to the fast time constants that are necessary for the generation of 
spikes. Hardware models of neurons with both slow and fast time constants have been 
designed based upon previously described Hodgkin-Huxley neuron models (Mahowald 
and Douglas, 1991). Although these circuits are good models of their biological counter- 
parts, they are relatively complex, with a large parameter space and transistor count, lim- 
iting their usefulness in the development of large-scale systems. It has been shown 
(Skinner, 1994), however, that pattern generation can be represented with only the slow 
time constants, creating a system that represents the envelope of the bursting oscillations 
without the individual spikes. Model neurons .with only slow time constants have been 
proposed by Morris and Lecar (1981). 
We have implemented an analog VLSI model of the Morris-Lecar Neuron (Patel and 
DeWeerth, 1997). Figure 1 shows the circuit diagram of this neuron. The model consists 
of two state variables: one corresponding to the membrane potential (V) and one corre- 
sponding to a slow variable (N). The slow variable is obtained by delaying the mere-

brane potential by way of an operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) connected in 
unity gain configuration with load capacitor C 2 . The membrane potential is obtained by 
injecting two positive currents (Iex t and i. ) and two negative currents (it. and isy  ) into 
capacitor C]. Current i u raises the membrane potential towards VHig h when the mem- 
brane potential increases above V H , whereas current it. lowers the membrane potential 
towards V[o, when the delayed membrane potential increases above Vt.. The synaptic 
current, isyn, activates when the presynaptic input, Vhe, increases above Vthh. 
Assuming operation of transistors in weak inversion and synaptic coupling turned off 
( isyn = 0 ) the equations of motion for the system are.

C 1 I2 = I 1 (V, N) = IextOt P + I H I + exp0c(V- VH)/UT )�tP - ILl + exp0c(N - VL)/UT) �rs 
C2/ - 12(V, N) = Ixtanh0c(V- N)/(2UT))(I -exp((N- Vdd )/UT))) 
The terms Ctp and GI, N, where Ctp = 1 - exp (V - VHigh)/U T and 
G/, N -' 1 -- exp(VLo, - V)/U T , correspond to the ohmic effect of transistor MI and M2 
respectively. c corresponds to the back-gate effect of a MOS transistor operated in weak 
inversion, and UT corresponds to the thermal voltage. We can understand the behavior of 
this circuit by analyzing the geometry of the curves that yield zero motion (i.e., when 
I](V,N) = 12(V,N ) = 0). These curves, referred to as nullclines, are shown in 
Figure 2 for various values of external current. 
The externally applied constant current (Ie,t), which has the effect of shifting the V 
nullcline in the positive vertical direction (see Figure 2), controls the mode of operation 
of the neuron. When the V- and N nullclines intersect between the local minimum and 
local maximum of the V nullcline (P2 in Figure 2), the resulting fixed point is unstable 
and the trajectories of the system approach a stable limit-cycle (an endogenous bursting 
mode). Fixed points to the left of the local minimum (P1 in Figure 2) or to the right of the 
local maximum (P3 in Figure 2) are stable and correspond to a silent mode and a tonic 
mode of the neuron respectively. An inhibitory synaptic current (isyn) has the effect of 
shifting the V nullcline in the negative vertical direction; depending on the state of a pre- 
synaptic cell, isy,can dynamically change the mode of operation of the neuron. 
3 TWO-CELL NETWORK 
When two cells are connected in a riprocally inhibitory network, the two cells will 
oscillate in antiphase depending on the conditions of the free and inhibited cells and the 
value of the synaptic threshold (Skinner et. al, 1994). We assume that the turn-on charac- 
teristics of the synaptic current is sharp (valid for large V.uip - V, ) such that when the 
membrane potential of a presynaptic cell reaches above Vthh, the postsynaptic cell is 
immediately inhibited by application of negative current Isy n tO its membrane potential.

If the free cell is an endogenous burster, the inhibited cell is silent, and the synaptic 
threshold is between the local maximum of the free cell and the local minimum in the 
inhibited cell, the mechanism for oscillation is due to intrinsic release. This mechanism 
can be understood by observing that the f
