Abstract 
We show that a simple spin system biased at its critical point can en- 
code spatial characteristics of external signals, such as the dilnensions of 
objects in the visual field, in the temporal correlation functions of indi- 
vidual spins. Qualitative arguments suggest that regularly firing neurons 
should be described by a planar spin of unit length, and such XY models 
exhibit critical dynamics over a broad range of paralneters. We show how 
to extract these spins from spike trains and then measure the interaction 
Hamiltonia. n using simulations of small clusters of cells. Static correla- 
tions among spike trains obtained kom silnulations of large arrays of cells 
are in agreement with the predictions from these Hamiltonians, and dy- 
namic correlations display the predict. ed encoding of spatial inforlnation. 
We suggest that this novel representation of object, dilnensions in temporal 
correlations may be relevant to recent experiments on oscillatory neural 
firing in the visual cortex. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
Physical systems at, a critical point exhibit tong-range correlations even though 
the interactiols among the constituent particles are of short range. Through the 
flucroat, ion-dissipation theorem this implies that the dynalnics at one point iu the

system are sensitive to external perturbations which are applied very far away. If 
we build an analog computer poised precisely at. such a critical point. it. should be 
possible to evaluate highly non-local fimctionals of the input signals using a locally 
interconnected architecture. Such a scheme would be very useful for visual compu- 
tations, especially those which require comparisons of widely separated regions of 
the image. Froin a biological poiut of view long-range correlations at. a critical point 
might provide a robust scenario for responses from beyond the classical receptive 
field [1]. 
In this paper we present an explicit model for analog computation a.t. a critical 
point and show that this model has a remarkable consequence: Because of dynamic 
scaling, spatial properties of input signals are mapped into temporal correlations 
of the local dynamics. One can, for example, measure the size and topology of 
objects in a scene using only the temporal correlations in the output of a single 
COlnputational unit (neuron) located within the object. We then show that our 
abstract model can be realized ill networks of senfi-realistic spiking neurons. The 
key to this construction is that neurons biased in a regime of regular or oscillatory 
firing can be mapped to XY or planar spins [2,3], and two-dimensional arrays of 
these spins exhibit a broad range of parameters in which the system is generically 
at a critical point.. Non-oscillatory lieurolm cannot, in general, be forced to operate 
at a critical point without delicate fine tuning of tile dynamics, fine tuning which 
is iraplausible both for biolog,v and for man-made analog circuits. We suggest that 
these arguments ilia}' be relevant to the recent observations of oscillatory firing in 
the visual cortex [4,5,6]. 
2 A STATISTICAL MECHANICS MODEL 
We consider a silnple two-dilnensional array of spins whose states are defined by unit 
two-vectors Sr. These spins interact with their neighbors so that the total energy of 
the systeln is H = -J ]] S,.S,,, with the sum restricted to nearest neighbor pairs. 
This is the XY model, which is interesting in part because it possesses not a critical 
point. but rather a critical line [7]. At a given temperature, for all J > J� one finds 
that correlations alnong spins decay algebraically, {Sty'S,,}  1/[r, -- r,,[ so that. 
there is no characteristic scale or correlation length; more precisely the correlation 
length is infinite. In COltrast, for J < J we },ave 
which defiues a finite correlation length 
In the algebraic phase the dynamics of the spins on long length scales are rigorously 
described by the spin wave approximation, in which one assumes that fluctuations 
in the angle between neighboring spins are small. In this regime it makes sense to 
use a continuum approximation rather than a lattice, and the energy of the system 
becomes H = J f d:xlV(x)[ -, where �(x) is the orientation of the spin at position 
x. The dynamics of the system are det. ermined by the Langevin equation

In fact. Eq. 3 is valid only for an infinite array of spins. Imagine that external signals 
to this array of spins Call activate and deactivate the spins so that one must 
really solve Eq. 1 on finite regions or clusters of active spills. Then we can write 
the analog of Eq. 3 as 
where /', and ,, are the eigenfimctious and associat, ed eigenvalues of (-V'-) on 
the region of active spills. The key point here is that the spill aut, o-correlation 
function ill time deterlllilles the spectrunl of the Laplacian on the region of act, ivity. 
But, from the classic work of Kac [8] we know that this spectrum gives a great 
deal of infornlat,ion about the size and shape of the act,ive region -- we call ill 
general determine the area, the length of the perilneter, and t,he topology (nunlber 
of holes) from the set, of eigenvalues {,,}, and this is true regardless of the absolute 
dimensions of the region. Thus by operating at a critical point we can achieve 
a scale-independent encoding of object. dimension and topology in the temporal 
correlations of a locally connected system.

MAPPING REAL NEURONS ONTO THE 
STATISTICAL MODEL 
All current nlodels of neural networks are based on the hope that. most. microscopic 
(biological) details are unilnportant. for the macroscopic, collective conlputational 
behavior of t. he system as a whole. Here we provide a rigorous comlection between a 
more realistic neural nlodel and a simplified lnodel with spin variables and effective 
int. eractions, essentially the XY model discussed above. A more detailed account is 
given in [2,3]. 
We use the Fitzhugh-Nagumo (FN) model [9,10] to describe the electrical dynanlics 
of an individual neuron. This model denlonstrates a threshold for firing action 
potentials, a refractory period, a.nd single-shot as well as repetitive firing --- in 
short., all the qualitative properties of neural firing. It is also known to provide a 
reasonable quaut.itative description of several cell types. To be realistic it. is essential 
to add a noise current 5l,(t) which we t.ake to be Gaussian, spectrally white. and 
independent in each cell ,. 
We COlmect each neuron to its neighbors ill regular one- and two-dilnensional arrays. 
More general local connections are easily added and do not significantly change the 
restilts presented below. We lnodel a synapse between two neurons by exponenti- 
at. ing the volla.ge from one and injecting it. as current into the other. Our choice is 
motivated by the fact t. hat the nnnlber of translnitter vesicles released at a synapse 
is exponential ill the presynaptic voltage Ill]; other synaptic transfer character- 
istics, including sinall delays, give results qualitatively similar to those described

derivative, we can extract the phase �(t) which describes the oscillation that un- 
derlies regular firing. Since the orientation of a planar spin is also described by a 
single phase variable, we can reduce the spike train to a time-dependent planar spin 
S(t). We now want. to see how these spins interact when we connect two cells via 
synapses. 
We characterize the two-neuron interaction by accumulating a histogram of the 
phase differences between two connected neurons. This probability distribntion

synapses (J > 0) the interaction is ferromagnetic, as expected (see Fig. 1). The 
Hamiltonian takes other interesting forms for inhibitory, delayed, and nonreciprocal 
synapses. By simulating sinall clusters of cells we find that interactions other than 
nearest neighbor are negligible. This leads us to predict that the entire network is 
described by the effective Hamiltonian H = Y]ij Hij(q 3i -3j), where Hij(q3 i --qSj) 
is the effective Halniltonian measured for the pair of connected cells i, j. 
One crucial consequence of Eq. 6 is that correlatiols of the filtered spike trains 
are exactly proportiona
