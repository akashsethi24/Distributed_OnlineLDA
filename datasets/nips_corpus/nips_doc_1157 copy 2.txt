Abstract 
The Neurothermostat is an adaptive controller that regulates in- 
door air temperature in a residence by switching a furnace on or 
off. The task is framed as an optimal control problem in which 
both comfort and energy costs are considered as part of the con- 
trol objective. Because the consequences of control decisions are 
delayed in time, the Neurothermostat must anticipate heating de- 
mands with predictive models of occupancy patterns and the ther- 
mal response of the house and furnace. Occupancy pattern predic- 
tion is achieved by a hybrid neural net / look-up table. The Neu- 
rothermostat searches, at each discrete time step, for a decision 
sequence that minimizes the expected cost over a fixed planning 
horizon. The first decision in this sequence is taken, and this pro- 
cess repeats. Simulations of the Neurothermostat were conducted 
using artificial occupancy data in which regularity was systemat- 
ically varied, as well as occupancy data from an actual residence. 
The Neurothermostat is compared against three conventional poli- 
cies, and achieves reliably lower costs. This result is robust to the 
relative weighting of comfort and energy costs and the degree of 
variability in the occupancy patterns. 
For over a quarter century, the home automation industry has promised to revolu- 
tionize our lifestyle with the so-called Smart House ï¿½ in which appliances, lighting, 
stereo, video, and security systems are integrated under computer control. How- 
ever, home automation has yet to make significant inroads, at least in part because 
software must be tailored to the home occupants. 
Instead of expecting the occupants to program their homes or to hire someone to 
do so, one would ideally like the home to essentially program itself by observing 
the lifestyle of the occupants. This is the goal of the Neural Network House (Mozer 
et al., 1995), an actual residence that has been outfitted with over 75 sensors- 
including temperature, light, sound, motion--and actuators to control air heating, 
water heating, lighting, and ventilation. In this paper, we describe one research 
954 M. C. Mozer, L. 7dmar and R. H. Dodier 
project within the house, the Neurothermostat, that learns to regulate the indoor 
air temperature automatically by observing and detecting patterns in the occupants' 
schedules and comfort preferences. We focus on the problem of air heating with 
a whole-house furnace, but the same approach can be taken with alternative or 
multiple heating devices, and to the problems of cooling and ventilation.

TEMPERATURE REGULATION AS AN OPTIMAL 
CONTROL PROBLEM 
Traditionally, the control objective of air temperature regulation has been to mini- 
mize energy consumption while maintaining temperature within an acceptable com- 
fort margin during certain times of the day and days of the week. This is sensible 
in commercial settings, where occupancy patterns follow simple rules and where 
energy considerations dominate individual preferences. In a residence, however, the 
desires and schedules of occupants need to be weighted equally with energy con- 
siderations. Consequently, we frame the task of air temperature regulation as a 
problem of maximizing occupant comfort and minimizing energy costs. 
These two objectives clearly conflict, but they can be integrated into a unified 
framework via an optimal control aproach in which the goal is to heat the house 
according to a policy that minimizes the cost 
i -to4-  
J = lim  z-,=to+ [e(ut) + m(x)], 
where time, t, is quantized into nonoverlapping intervals during which we assume 
all environmental variables remain constant, to is the interval ending at the current 
time, ut is the control decision for interval t (e.g., turn the furnace on), e(u) is the 
energy cost associated with decision u, xt is the environmental state during interval 
t, which includes the indoor temperature and the occupancy status of the home, 
and re(x) is the misery of the occupant given state x. To add misery and energy 
costs, a common currency is required. Energy costs are readily expressed in dollars. 
We also determine misery in dollars, as we describe later. 
While we have been unable to locate any earlier work that combined energy and 
comfort costs in an optimal control framework, optimal control has been used in a 
variety of building energy system control applications (e.g., Henze & Dodier, 1996; 
Khalid & Omatu, 1995). 
2 THE NEUROTHERMOSTAT 
Figure i shows the system architecture of the Neurothermostat and its interaction 
with the environment. The heart of the Neurothermostat is a controller that, at 
time intervals of 6 minutes, can switch the house furnace on or off. Because the con- 
sequences of control decisions are delayed in time, the controller must be predictive 
to anticipate heating demands. The three boxes in the Figure depict components 
that predict or model various aspects of the environment. We explain their purpose 
via a formal description of the controller operation. 
The controller considers sequences of  decisions, _denoted u, and searches for the 
sequence that minimizes the expected total cost, Ju, over the planning horizon of 
6 minutes: 
where the expectation is computed over future states of the environment conditional 
on the decision sequence u. The energy cost in an interval depends only on the 
control decision during that interval. The misery cost depends on two components

of the state--the house occupancy status, o(t) (0 for empty, i for occupied), and 
the indoor air temperature, hu(t): 
rhu(o(t),hu(t)) = p[o(t) = 1] rn(1, hu(t)) + p[o(t) = O] rn(O, hu(t)) 
Because the true quantities e, hu, rn, and p are unknown, they must be estimated. 
The house thermal model of Figure i provides  and hu, the occupant comfort cost 
model provides rh, and the home occupancy predictor provides/5. 
We follow a tradition of using neural networks for prediction in the context of build- 
ing energy system control (e.g., Curtiss, Kreider, & Brandemuehl, 1993; Ferrano & 
Wong, 1990; Miller & Seem, 1991), although in our initial experiments we require 
a network only for the occupancy prediction. 
2.1 PREDICTIVE OPTIMAL CONTROLLER 
We propose a closed-loop controller that combines prediction with fixed-horizon 
planning, of the sort proposed by Clarke, Mohtadi, and Tuffs (1987). At each 
time step, the controller considers all possible decision sequences over the planning 
horizon and selects the sequence that minimizes the expected total cost, J. The 
first decision in this sequence is then performed. After 5 minutes, the planning and 
execution process is repeated. This approach assumes that beyond the planning 
horizon, all costs are independent of the first decision in the sequence. 
While dynamic programming is an efficient search algorithm, it requires a discrete 
state space. Wishing to avoid quantizing the continuous variable of indoor temper- 
ature, and the errors that might be introduced, we performed performed exhaustive 
search through the possible decision sequences, which was tractable due to rela- 
tively short horizons and two additional domain constraints. First, because the 
house occupancy status can reasonably be assumed to be independent of the in- 
toor temperature,/5 need not be recalculated for every possible decision sequence. 
Second, the current occupancy status depends on the recent occupancy history. 
Consequently, one needs to predict occupancy patterns over the planning horizon, 
o 6 {0, 1}  to compute/5. However, because most occupancy sequences are highly 
improbable, we find that considering only the most likely sequences--those contain- 
ing at most two occupancy state transitions--produces the same decisions as doing 
the search over the entire distribution, reducing the cost from O(2 ) to O(n2). 
2.2 OCCUPANCY PREDICTOR 
The basic task of the occupancy predictor is to estimate the probability that the 
occupant will be home 5 minutes in the future. The occupancy predictor can be 
run iteratively to estimate the probability of an occupancy pattern. 
If occupants follow a deterministic daily schedule, a look up table indexed by time 
of day and current occupancy state should capture occupancy patterns. We thus 
use a look up table to encode whatever structure possible, and a neural network 
956 M. C. Mozer, L. Iqdmar and R. H. Dodier 
to encode residual structure. The look up table divides time into fixed 5 minute 
bins. The neural network consisted of the following inputs: current time of day; day 
of the week; average proportion of time home was occupied in the 10, 20, and 30 
minutes from the present time of day on the previous three days and on the same 
day of the week during the past four weeks; and the proportion of time the home 
was occupied during the past 60, 180, and 360 minutes. The network, a standard 
three-layer architecture, was trained by back propagation. The number of hidden 
units was chosen by cross validation. 
2.3 THERMAL MODEL OF HOUSE AND FURNACE 
A thermal model of the house and furnace predicts future indoor temperature(s) 
as a function of the outdoor temperature and the furnace operation. While one 
could perform system identification using neural networks, a simple parameterized 
resistance-capacitance (RC) model provides a reasonable first-order approximation. 
The RC model assumes that: the inside of the house is at a uniform temperature, 
and likewise the outside; a homogeneous fiat wall separates the inside and outside, 
and this wall has a thermal resistance R and
