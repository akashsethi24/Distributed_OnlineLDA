ABSTRACT 
The firing patterns of populations of cells in the cat visual cor- 
tex can exhibit oscillatory responses in the range of 35 - 85 Hz. 
Furthermore, groups of neurons many tom's apart can be highly 
synchronized as long as the cells have similar orientation tuning. 
We investigate two basic network architectures that incorporate ei- 
ther nearest-neighbor or global feedback interactions and conclude 
that non-local feedback plays a fundamental role in the initial syn- 
chronization and dynamic stability of the oscillations. 
I INTRODUCTION 
40 -- 60 Hz oscillations have long been reported in the rat and rabbit olfactory 
bulb and cortex on the basis of single- and multi-unit recordings as well as EEG 
activity (Freeman, 1972; Wilson & Bower 1990). Recently, two groups (Eckhorn e! 
el., 1988 and Gray e! el., 1989) have reported highly synchronized, stimulus specific 
oscillations in the 35 - 85 Hz range in areas 17, 18 and PMLS of anesthetized as 
well as awake cats. Neurons with similar orientation tuning up to 7 mm apart show 
phase-locked oscillations, with a phase shift of less than 3 msec. We address here 
the computational architecture necessary to subserve this process by investigating 
to what extent two neuronal architectures, nearest-neighbor coupling and feedback 
from a central comparator, can synchronize neuronal oscillations in a robust and 
rapid manner. 
Collective Oscillations in the Visual Cortex 77 
It was argued in earlier work on central pattern generators (Cohen et al., 1982), that 
in studying coupling effects among large populations of oscillating neurons, one can 
ignore the details of individual oscillators and represent each one by a single periodic 
variable: its phase. Our approach assumes a population of neuronal oscillators, 
firing repetitively in response to synaptic input. Each cell (or group of tightly 
electrically coupled cells) has an associated variable representing the membrane 
potential. In particular, when 0i - r, an action potential is generated and the 
phase is reset to its initial value (in our case to -r). The number of times per unit 
time 0i passes through r, i.e. dOi/dt, is then proportional to the firing frequency of 
the neuron. For a network of n + I such oscillators, our basic model is 
dOi 
-- wi + fi(0o,Ol,...,O,), (1) 
dt 
where wi represents the synaptic input to neuron i and f, a function of the phases, 
represents the coupling within the network. Each oscillator i in isolation (i.e. with 
fi - 0), exhibits asymptotically stable periodic oscillations; that is, if the input 
is changed the oscillator will rapidly adjust to a new firing rate. In our model wi 
is assumed to derive from neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and is 
purely excitatory. 
2 FREQUENCY AND PHASE LOCKING 
Any realistic model of the observed, highly synchronized, oscillations must account 
for the fact that the individual neurons oscillate at different frequencies in isolation. 
This is due to variations in the synaptic input, wi, as well as in the intrinsic prop- 
erties of the cells. We will contrast the abilities of two markedly different network 
architectures to synchronize these oscillations. The chain model (Fig. I top ) con- 
sists of a one-dimensional array of oscillators connected to their nearest neighbors, 
while in the alternative comparator model (Fig. I middle), an array of neurons 
project to a single unit, where the phases are averaged (i.e. (l/n) 'i--0 0i(t)). This 
average is then feed back to every neuron in the network. In the continuum limit 
(on the unit interval) with all fi - f being identical, the two models are 
(Chain Model) O0(x, t) = w(x) + - (c) 
Ot n 
(Comparator Model) O0(x,t) = w(x) + f(O(x,t) - fo  
ot 
(2) 
O(s,t)ds), (3) 
where 0 < x < 1 and b is the phase gradient, b =  os 
_ _ ;. In the chain model, we 
require that f be an odd function (for simplicity of analysis only) while our analysis 
of the comparator model holds for any continuous function f. We use two spatially 
separated spots of width 5 and amplitude a as visual input (Fig. I bottom). This 
pattern was chosen as a simple version of the double-bar stimulus that (Gray et al. 
1989) found to evoke coherent oscillatory activity in widely separated populations 
of visual cortical cells.

Figure 1: The linear chain (top) and comparator (middle) architectures. The 
spatial pattern of inputs is indicated by ozi(x). See equs. 2 & 3 for a mathematical 
description of the models. The two spot input is shown at bottom and represents 
two parts of a perceptually extended figure. 
We determine under what circumstances the chain model will develop frequency- 
locked solutions, such that every oscillator fires at the same frequency (but not 
necessarily at the same time), i.e. OO/OxO! = O. We prove (Kammen, et al. 1990) 
that frequency-locked solutions exist as long as In(x - f o:(s)ds)l does not exceed 
the maximal value of f, fmax (with  = fo  o�(s)ds the mean excitation level). 
Thus, if the excitation is too irregular or the chain too long (n >> 1), we will not 
find frequency-locked solutions. Phase coherence between the excited regions is not 
generally maintained and is, in fact, strongly a function of the initial conditions. 
Another feature of the chain model is that the onset of frequency locking is slow 
and takes time of order V . 
The location of the stimulus has no effect on phase relationships in the comparator 
model due to the global nature of the feedback. The comparator model exhibits 
two distinct regimes of behavior depending on the amplitude of the input, a. In the 
case of the two spot input (Fig. I bottom ), if c is small, all neurons will frequency- 
lock regardless of location, that is units responding to both the figure and the 
background (ground) will oscillate at the same frequency. They will, however, 
fire at different times, with Ofi  Onct. If  is above a critical threshold, the units 
responding to the figure will decouple in frequency as well as phase from the 
background while still maintaining internal phase coherency. Phase gradients never 
exist within the excited groups, no matter what the input amplitude. 
Collective Oscillations in the Visual Cortex 79 
We numerically simulated the chain and comparator models with the two spot input 
for the coupling function f(r) -- sin(r). Additive Gaussian noise was included in the 
input, cvi. Our analytical results were confirmed; frequency and phase gradients were 
always present in the chain model (Fig. 2A) even though the coupling strength was 
ten times greater than that of the comparator model. In the comparator network 
small excitation levels led to frequency-locking along the entire array and to phase- 
coupled activity within the illuminated areas (Fig. 2B), while large excitation levels 
led to phase and frequency decoupling between the figure and the background 
(Fig. 2C). The excited regions in the comparator settle very rapidly - within 2 to 
3 cycles - into phase-locked activity with small phase-delays. The chain model, on 
the other hand, exhibits strong sensitivity to initial conditions as well as a very slow 
approach to coherence that is still not complete even after 50 cycles (See Fig. 2).

model has been dragged along by the flanking excited regions. 
3 STABILITY ANALYSIS 
Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of the oscillations concerns the role that they 
may play in cortical information processing and the labeling of cells responding to a 
single perceptual object. To be useful in object coding, the oscillations must exhibit 
some degree of noise tolerance both in the input signal and in the stability of the 
population to variation in the firing times of individual cells. 
The degree to which input noise to individual neurons disrupts the synchronization 
of the population is determined by the ratio input noise -- w/- For small per- 
couplintl strentlth  ' 
turbations, w(t) - wo d- e(t), the action of the feedback, from the nearest neighbors 
in the chain and from the entire network in the comparator, will compensate for 
the noise and the neuron will maintain coherence with the excited population. As 
e is increased first phase and then frequency coherence will be lost. 
In Fig. 3 we compare the dynamical stability of the chain and comparator models. 
In each case the phase, 0, of a unit receiving perturbated input is plotted as the 
deviation from the average phase, 00, of all the excited units receiving input w0. The 
chain in highly sensitive to noise: even 10% stochastic noise significantly perturbs 
the phase of the neuron. In the comparator model (Fig. 3B) noise must reach the 
80 Kammen, Koch and Holmes 
40% level to have a similar effect on the phase. As the noise increases above 0.30w0 
even frequency coherence is lost in the chain model (broken error bars). Frequency 
coherence is maintained in the comparator for  = 0.60w0.
