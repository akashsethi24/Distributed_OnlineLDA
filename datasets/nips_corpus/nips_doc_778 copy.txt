Abstract 
We developed a system for finding address blocks on mail pieces that can 
process four images per second. Besides locating the address block, our 
system also determines the writing style, handwritten or machine printed, and 
moreover, it measures the skew angle of the text lines and cleans noisy 
images. A layout analysis of all the elements present in the image is 
performed in order to distinguish drawings and dirt from text and to separate 
text of advertisement from that of the destination address. 
A speed of more than four images per second is obtained on a modular 
hardware platform, containing a board with two of the NET32K neural net 
chips, a SPARC2 processor board, and a board with 2 digital signal 
processors. The system has been tested with more than 100,000 images. Its 
performance depends on the quality of the images, and lies between 85% 
correct location in vej noisy images to over 98% in cleaner images. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
The system described here has been integrated into an address reading machine developed for 
the 'Remote Computer Reader' project of the United States Postal Service. While the actual 
reading of the text is done by other modules, this system solves one of the major problems, 
namely, finding reliably the location of the destination address. There are only a few constraints 
on how and where an address has to be written, hence they may appear in a wide variety of 
styles and layouts. Often an envelope contains advertising that includes images as well as text.

Sometimes, dirt covers part of the envelope image, including the destination address. Moreover, 
the image captured by the camera is thresholded and the reader is given a binary image. This 
binahzation process introduces additional distortions; in particular, often the destination address 
is surrounded by a heavy texture. The high complexity of the images and their poor quality make 
it difficult to find the location of the destination address, requiring an analysis of all the elements 
present in the image. Such an analysis is compute-intensive and in our system it turned out to 
be the major bottleneck for a fast throughput. In fact, finding the address requires much more 
computation than reading it. Special-purpose hardware in the form of the NET32K neural net 
chips (Graf, Henderson, 90) is used to solve the address location problem. 
Finding address blocks has been the focus of intensive research recently, as several companies 
are developing address reading machines (United States Postal Service 92). The wide variety 
of images that have to be handled has led other researchers to apply several different analysis 
techniques to each image and then t. to combine the results at the end, see e.g. (Palumbo et al. 
92). In order to achieve the throughput required in an industrial application, special purpose 
processors for finding connected components and/or for executing Hough transforms have been 
applied. 
In our system we use the NET32K processor to extract geometrical features from an image. The 
high compute power of this chip allows the extraction of a large number of features 
simultaneously. From this feature representation, an interpretation of the image's content can 
then be achieved with a standard processor. Compared to an analysis of the original image, the 
analysis of the feature maps requires several orders of magnitude less computation. Moreover, 
the feature representation introduces a high level of robustness against noise. This paper gives 
a brief overview of the hardware platform in section 2 and then describes the algorithms to find 
the address blocks in section 3. 
2 THE HARDWARE 
The NET32K system has been designed to serve as a high-speed image processing platform, 
where neural nets as well as conventional algorithms can be executed. Three boards form the 
whole system. Two NET32K neural net chips are integrated with a sequencer and data 
formatting circuits on one board. The second board contains two digital signal processors 
(DSPs), together with 6 Mbytes ofmemolj. Control of the whole system is provided by a board 
containing a SPARC2 processor plus 64 Mbytes of memory. A schematic of this system is 
shown in Figm'e 1. 
Image buffering and communication with other modules in the address reader are handled by 
the board with the SPARC2 processor. When an image is received, it is sent to the DSP board 
and from there over to the NET32K processor. The feature maps produced by the NET32K 
processor are stored on the DSP board, while the SPARC2 starts with the analysis of the feature 
maps. The DSP's main task is formatting of the data, while the NET32K processor extracts all 
the features. Its speed of computation is more than 100 billion multiply-accumulates per second 
with operands that have one or two bits of resolution. Images with a size of 512x512 pixels are 
processed at a rate of more than 10 fi'ames per second, and 64 convolution kernels, each with 
a size of 16x16 pixels, can be scanned simultaneously over the image. Each such kemel is 
tuned to detect the presence of a feature, such as a line, an edge or a comer.

3. SEQUENCE OF ALGORITHMS 
The final result of the adch'ess block location system is a box describing a tight bound around 
the destination address, if the address is machine printed. Of handwritten addresses, only the 
zip code is read, and hence, one has to find a tight boundary around the zip code. This 
information is then passed along to reader modules of the address reading machine. There is no 
a priori knowledge about the writing style. Therefore the system first has to discriminate 
between handwritten and machine printed text. At the end of the address block location process, 
additional algorithms are executed to improve the accuracy of the reader. An overview of the 
sequence of algorithms used to solve these tasks is shown in Figure 2. The whole process is 
divided into three major steps: Preprocessing, featm'e extraction, and high-level analysis based 
on the feature information. 
3.1. Preprocessing 
To quickly get an idea about the complexity of the image, a coarse evaluation of its layout is 
done. By sampling the density of the black pixels in various places of the image, one can see 
already whether the image is clean or noisy and whether the text is lightly printed or is dark.

The images are divided into four categories, depending on their darkness and the level of noise. 
This information is used in the subsequent processing to guide the choice of the features. Only 
about one percent of the pixels are taken into account for this analysis, therefore, it can be 
executed quickly on the SPARC2 processor.

3.2. Feature Extraction 
After the preprocessing, the image is sent to the NET32K board where simple geometrical 
features, such as edges, corners and lines are extracted. Up to 16 different feature maps are 
generated, where a pixel in one of the maps indicates the presence of a feature in this location. 
Some of these feature maps are used by the host processor, for example, to decide whether text 
is handwritten or machine printed. Other feature maps are combined and sent once more 
through the NET32K processor in order to search for combinations of features representing 
more complex features. Typically, the feature maps are thresholded, so that only one bit per 
pixel is kept. More resolution of the computation results is available from the neural net chips, 
but in this way the amount of data that has to be analyzed is minimal, and one bit of resolution 
turned out to be sufficient. 
Examples of kernels used for the detection of stxokes and text lines are shown in Figure 3. In 
the chip, usually four line detectors of increasing height plus eight stroke detectors of different 
orientations are stored. Other detectors are tuned to edges and su'okes of machine printed text. 
The line detectors respond to any black line of the proper height. Due to the large width of 16

pixels, a kemel stretches over one or even several characters. Hence a text line gives a response 
similar to that produced by a continuous black line. When the threshold is set properly, a text 
line in the original image produces a continuous line in the feature map, even across the gaps 
between characters and across small empty spaces between words. For an interpretation of a 
line feature map only the lea and right end points of each connected component are stored. In 
this way one obtains a compact representation of the lines' positions that are well suited for the 
high-level analysis of the layout.
