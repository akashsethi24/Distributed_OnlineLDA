Abstract 
We train recurrent networks to control chemotaxis in a computer 
model of the nematode C. elegant. The model presented is based 
closely on the body mechanics, behavioral analyses, neuroanatomy 
and neurophysiology of G. elegans, each imposing constraints rel- 
evant for information processing. Simulated worms moving au- 
tonomously in simulated chemical environments display a variety 
of chemotaxis strategies si_m_ilar to those of biological worms. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
The nematode C'. eleï¿½ans provides a unique opportunity to study the neuronal ba- 
sis of neural computation in an animal capable of complex goal-oriented behaviors. 
The adult hermaphrodite is only 1 mm long, and has exactly 302 neurons and 95 
muscle cells. The morphology of every cell and the location of most electrical and 
chemical synapses are known precisely (White et aL, 1986), making C. elegans espe- 
cially attractive for study. Whole-cell recordings are now being made on identified 
neurons in the nerve ring of G. elegans to determine electrophysiological properties 
which underly information processing in this animal (Lockery and Goodman, un- 
published). However, the strengths and polarities of synaptic connections are not 
known, so we use neural network optimization to find sets of synaptic strengths 
which reproduce actual nematode behavior in a simulated worm. 
We focus on chemotaxis, the ability to move up (or down) a gradient of chemical 
attractants (or repellants). In the laboratory, flat Petri dishes (radius = 4.25 cm) 
are prepared with a Gaussian-shaped field of attractant at the center, and worms 
are allowed to move freely about. Worms propel themselves forward by generating 
an undulatory body wave, which produces sinusoidal movement. In chemotaxis, the 
nervous system generates motor commands which bias this movement and direct

the animal toward higher attractant concentration. 
Anatomical constraints pose important problems for C. ele.qar during chemotaxis. 
In particular, the animal detects the presence of chemicals with a pair of sensory 
organs (ampbids) at the tip of the nose, each containing the processes of multiple 
chemosensory neurons. During normal locomotion, however, the animal moves on 
its side so that the two ampbids are perpendicular to the Petri dish. C. ele.qar can- 
not, therefore, sense the gradient directly. One possible strategy for cherootaxis, 
which has been suggested previously (Ward, 1973), is that the animal computes a 
temporal derivative of the local concentration during a single head sweep, and com- 
bines this with some form of proprioceptive feedback indicating muscle contraction 
and the direction of head sweep, to compute the spatial gradient for cherootaxis. 
The existence of this and other strategies is discussed later. 
In Section 2, we derive a simple model of the nematode body which produces realis- 
tic sinusoidal trajectories in response to motor commands from the nervous system. 
In Section 3, we give a simple model of the C'. ele.qar nervous system based on 
prelim_nary physiological data. In Section 4, we use a stochastic optimization algo- 
rithm to determine sets of synaptic weights which control chemotaxis, and discuss 
solutions. 
2 BIOMECHANICS OF NEMATODE ORIENTATION 
Nematode locomotion has been studied in detail (Niebur and ErdSs, 1991; Niebur 
and ErdSs, 1993). These authors derived NewtonJan force equations for each mus- 
cular segment of the body, which can be solved numerically to generate forward 
sinusoidal movement. Unfortunately, such a thorough treatment is computation- 
ally intensive and not practical to use with network optimization. To simplify the 
problem we first recognize that chemotaxis is a behavior more of orientation than of 
locomotion. We therefore derive a set of biomechanical equations which direct the 
head to generate sinusoidal movement, which can be biased by the network toward 
higher chemical concentrations. 
We focus our attention on the point (x, y) at the tip of the nose, since that is where 
the animal senses the chemical environment. As shown in Figure l(a), we assign 
a velocity vector t7 directed along the midline of the first body segment, i.e., the 
head. Assuming that the worm moves forward at constant speed v, we can write 
the velocity vector as 
(dx dy) = (vcosO(t),vsinO(t)) 
(t)---- ,  
(1) 
where x, y and 0 are measured relative to fixed coordinates in the Petri dish. 
Assuming that the worm moves without lateral slipping and that the undulatory 
wave of muscular contraction initiated in the neck travels posteriorally without 
modification, then each body segment simply follows the one previous (anterior) to 
it. In this way, the head directs the movement and the rest of the body simply 
follows. 
Figure l(b) shows an expanded view of the neck segment. As the worm moves 
forward, the posterior boundary of that segment assumes the position held by its 
anterior neighbor at a slightly earlier time. If L is the total body length and N is

the number of body segments, then this time delay is at _ L]Nv. (For L = 1 ram, 
v = 0.22 rnm/s and N = 10 we have at - 0.45 s, roughly an order of magnitude 
smaller than the relevant behavioral time scale: the head-sweep period T _ 4.2 s.) 
If we define the neck angle a(t) -- 01(t) - 02(t), then the above arguments imply 
a(t) = o(t) - o(t - at) ,,, ao2 at 
(2) 
where the second relation is essentially a backward-Euler algorithm for 
Since 0 -- 0, we have reached the intuitive result that the neck angle a determines 
the rate of turning dS]dr. Note that while 0 and 02 are defined relative to the 
fixed laboratory coordinates, their difference a is invariant under rotations of these 
coordinates, and can therefore be viewed as intrinsic to the body. This allows us 
to derive an expression for a in terms of muscle cell contraction, or motor neuron 
depolarization, as follows.

dorsal (D) and ventral (V) neck muscles. 
Nematodes maintain nearly constant volume during movement. To incorporate this 
constraint, albeit approximately, we assume that at all times the geometry of each 
segment is such that (/D --lo) -- --(/V- lo), where lo  L/N is the equilibrium length 
of a relaxed segment. For small angles a, we have a _ (/v - ID)/d, where d is the 
body diameter. The dashed lines in Figure l(b) indicate dorsal and ventral muscles, 
which are believed to develop tension nearly independent of length (Toida et 
1975). When contracting, these muscles must work ag_aJnst the elasticity of the 
cuticle, internal fluid pressure, and elasticity and developed tension of the opposing 
muscles. If these elastic forces act linearly, then To-Tv - k (/v--lb), where TD and 
Tv are dorsal and ventral muscle tensions, and k is an effective force constant. For 
simplicity, we further assume that each muscle develops tension linearly in response 
to the voltage of its corresponding motor neuron, i.e., TD,V --  VD,V, where  is a 
positive constant, and VD and Vv are dorsal and ventral motor neuron voltages. 
Combining these results, we have finally

(3) can be integrated numerically to generate sinusoidal worm trajectories like those 
of biological worms. This model embodies the main anatomical features that are 
likely to be important in C. elegans cherootaxis, yet is sufficiently compact to be 
embedded in a network optimization procedure. 
3 CHEMOTAXIS CONTROL CIRCUIT 
C. elegans neurons are tiny and have very simple morpologies: a typical neuron 
in the head has a spherical soma 1-2 /m in diameter, and a single cylindrical 
process 60-80/m in length and 0.1-0.2/m in diameter. Compartmental mod- 
els, based on this morphology and preliminary physiological recordings, indicate 
that C. elegans neurons are effectively isopotential (Lockery, 1995). Furthermore, 
C. elegans neurons do not fire classical all-or-none action potentials, but appear to 
rely primarily on graded signal propagation (Lockery and Goodman, unpublished). 
Thus, a reasonable starting point for a network model is to represent each neuron 
by a single isopotential compartment, in which voltage is the state variable, and the 
membrane conductance in purely ohmic. 
Anatomical data indicate that the C. elegans nervous system has both electrical and 
chemical synapses, but the synaptic transfer functions are not bnown. However, 
steady-state synaptic transfer functions for chemical synapses have been measured 
in Ascaris suurn, a related species of nematode, where it was found that postsynaptic 
voltage is a graded function of presynaptic voltage, due to tonic neurotransmitter 
release (Davis and Stretton, 1989). This voltage dependence is sigmoidal, i.e., 
Vpost  tanh(Vpre). A simple network model which captures all of these features is

to a common resting potential, Vmax is an arbitrary voltage scale which sets the 
operational range of the neurons, and f] sets the voltage sensitivity of the synaptic 
transfer function. The weight wij represents the net strength and polarity of all 
synaptic connections from neuron j to neuron i, and the constants  determine the 
center of each transfer function. The membane time constant r is assumed to be 
the same for all cells, and will be
