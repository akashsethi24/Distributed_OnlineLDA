Abstract 
We propose a model for early visual processing in primates. The 
model consists of a population of linear spatial filters which inter- 
act through non-linear excitatory and inhibitory pooling. Statisti- 
cal estimation theory is then used to derive human psychophysical 
thresholds from the responses of the entire population of units. The 
model is able to reproduce human thresholds for contrast and ori- 
entation discrimination tasks, and to predict contrast thresholds in 
the presence of masks of varying orientation and spatial frequency. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
A remarkably wide range of human visual thresholds for spatial patterns appears to 
be determined by the earliest stages of visual processing, namely, orientation- and 
spatial frequency-tuned visual filters and their interactions [18, 19, 3, 22, 9]. Here we 
consider the possibility of quantitatively relating arbitrary spatial vision thresholds 
to a single computational model. The success of such a unified account should 
reveal the extent to which human spatial vision indeed reflects one particular stage 
of processing. Another motivation for this work is the controversy over the neural 
circuits that generate orientation and spatial frequency tuning in striate cortical 
neurons [13, 8, 2]. We think it is likely that behaviorally defined visual filters 
and their interactions reveal at least some of the characteristics of the underlying 
neural circuitry. Two specific problems are addressed: (i) what is the minimal set 
of model components necessary to account for human spatial vision, (ii) is there 
a general decision strategy which relates model responses to behavioral thresholds 
and which obviates case-by-case assumptions about the decision strategy in different 
behavioral situations. To investigate these questions, we propose a computational 
model articulated around three main stages: first, a population of bandpass linear 
filters extracts visual features from a stimulus; second, linear filters interact through 
non-linear excitatory and inhibitory pooling; third, a noise model and decision 
strategy are assumed in order to relate the model's output to psychophysical data.

2 MODEL 
We assume spatial visual filters tuned for a variety of orientations 0  0 and 
spatial periods   A. The filters have overlapping receptive fields in visual space. 
Quadrature filter pairs, F even and 
,0  ,0 , are used to compute a phase-independent 
linear energy response, E,,o, to a visual stimulus q. A small constant background 
activity, e, is added to the linear energy responses: 
/l l;,even [ lodd 
E,o = V,., . 
Filters have separable Gaussian tuning curves in orientation and spatial frequency. 
Their corresponding shape in visual space is close to that of Gabor filters, although 
not separable along spatial dimensions. 
2.1 Pooling: self excitation and divisive inhibition 
A model based on linear filters alone would not correctly account for the non-linear 
response characteristics to stimulus contrast which have been observed psychophys- 
ically [19]. Several models have consequently introduced a non-linear transducer 
stage following each linear unit [19]. A more appealing possibility is to assume a 
non-linear pooling stage [6, 21, 3, 22]. In this study, we propose a pooling strategy 
inspired by Heeger's model for gain control in cat area V1 [5, 6]. The pooled re- 
sponse Rx,o of a unit tuned for (A, 0) is computed from the linear energy responses 
of the entire population' E 
= + + 
where the sum is taken over the entire population and Wx,s is a two-dimensional 
Gaussian weighting function centered around (, 0), and q a background activity. 
The numerator in Eq. 1 represents a non-linear self-excitation term. The denomi- 
nator represents a divisive inhibitory term which depends not only on the activity 
of the unit (A, 0) of interest, but also on the responses of other units. We shall see 
in Section 3 that, in contrast to Heeger's model for electrophysiological data in 
which all units contribute equally to the pool, it is necessary to assume that only a 
subpopulation of units with tuning close to (A, 0) contribute to the pool in order to 
account for psychophysical data. Also, we assume 7 > 5 to obtain a power law for 
high contrasts [7], as opposed to Heeger's physiological model in which 7 = 5 = 2 
to account for neuronal response saturation at high contrasts. 
Several interesting properties result from this pooling model. First, a sigmoidal 
transducer function - in agreement with contrast discrimination psychophysics - is 
naturally obtained through pooling and thus need not be introduced post-hoc. The 
transducer slope for high contrasts is determined by 7-5, the location of its infiexion 
point by S, and the slope at this point by the absolute value of 7 (and 5). Second, the 
tuning curves of the pooled units for orientation and spatial period do not depend 
of stimulus contrast, in agreement with physiological and psychophysical evidence 
[14]. In comparison, a model which assumes a non-linear transducer but no pooling 
exhibits sharper tuning curves for lower contrasts. Full contrast independence of 
the tuning is achieved only when all units participate in the inhibitory pool; when 
only sub-populations participate in the pool, some contrast dependence remains. 
2.2 Noise model: Poisson  
It is necessary to assume the presence of noise in the system in order to be able to 
derive psychophysical performance from the responses of the population of pooled

units. The deterministic response of each unit then represents the mean of a ran- 
domly distributed neuronal response which varies from trial to trial in a simulated 
psychophysical experiment. 
Existing models usually assume constant noise variance in order to simplify the 
subsequent decision stage [18]. Using the decision strategy presented below, it is 
however possible to derive psychophysical performance with a noise model whose 
variance increases with mean activity, in agreement with electrophysiology [16]. 
In what follows, Poisson  noise will be assumed and approximated by a Gaussian 
random variable with variance =rnean  ( is a constant close to unity). 
2.3 Decision strategy 
We use tools from statistical estimation theory to compute the system's behavioral 
response based on the responses of the population of pooled units. Similar tools 
have been used by Seung and Sompolinsky [12] under the simplifying assumption of 
purely Poisson noise and for the particular task of orientation discrimination in the 
limit of an infinite population of oriented units. Here, we extend this framework 
to the more general case in which any stimulus attribute may differ between the 
two stimulus presentations to be discriminated by the model. Let's assume that we 
want to estimate psychophysical performance at discriminating between two stimuli 
which differ by the value of a stimulus parameter ( (e.g. contrast, orientation, 
spatial period). 
The central assumption of our decision strategy is that the brain implements an 
unbiased eJficient statistic T(; (), which is an estimator of the parameter ( based 
on the population response T = {R,s;   A, 0  ï¿½). The efficient statistic is 
the one which, among all possible estimators of (, has the property of minimum 
variance in the estimated value of (. Although we are not suggesting any putative 
neuronal correlate for T, it is important to note that the assumption of efficient 
statistic does not require T to be prohibitively complex; for instance, a maximum 
likelihood estimator proposed in the decision stage of several existing models is 
asymptotically (with respect to the number of observations) a efficient statistic. 
Because T is efficient, it achieves the Cramr-Rao bound [1]. Consequently, when 
the number of observations (i.e. simulated psychophysical trials) is large, 
E[T] =  and var[2- = 1/,7() 
where E[.] is the mean over all observations, vat[.] the variance, and ,7(() is the 
Fisher information. The Fisher information can be computed using the noise model 
assumption and tuning properties of the pooled units: for a random variable X 
with probability density f(x; ), it is given by [1]: 
2 
For our Poisson  noise model and assuming that different pooled units are inde- 
pendent [15], this translates into: 
One unit Rx,s: Jx,s(() = \ 
All independent units: J(() = x,s J,s(() 
The Fisher information computed for each pooled unit and three types of stimulus 
parameters ( is shown in Figure 1. This figure demonstrates the importance of 
using information from all units in the population rather than from only one unit 
optimally tuned for the stimulus: although the unit carrying the most information 
about contrast is the one optimally tuned to the stimulus pattern, more information

about orientation or spatial frequency is carried by units which are tuned to flanking 
orientations and spatial periods and whose tuning curves have maximum slope for 
the stimulus rather than maximum absolute sensitivity. In our implementation, 
the derivatives of pooled responses used in the expression of Fisher information are 
computed numerically.
