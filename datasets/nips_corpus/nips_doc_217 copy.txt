ABSTRACT 
The echolocating bat, Eptesicus fuscus, perceives the distance to 
sonar targets from the delay of echoes and the shape of targets 
from the spectrum of echoes. However, shape is perceived in 
terms of the target's range profile. The time separation of echo 
components from parts of the target located at different distances 
is reconstructed from the echo spectrum and added to the 
estimate of absolute delay already derived from the arrival-time 
of echoes. The bat thus perceives the distance to targets and 
depth within targets along the same psychological range 
dixnension, which is computed. The image corresponds to the 
crosscorrelation function of echoes. Fusion of physiologically 
distinct time- and frequency-domain representations into a fmal, 
common time-domain image illustrates the binding of within- 
modality features into a unified, whole image. To support the 
structure of images along the dimension of range, bats can 
perceive echo delay with a hyperacuity of 10 nanoseconds.

THE SONAR OF BATS 
Bats are flying mammals, whose lives are largely noctumal. They have evolved 
the capacity to orient in darkness using a biological sonar called echolocation, 
which they use to avoid obstacles to flight and to detect, identify, and track flying 
insects for interception (Griffin, 1958). Echolocating bats emit brief, mostly 
ultrasonic sonar sounds and perceive objects from echoes that return to their ears. 
The bat's auditory system acts as the sonar receiver, processing echoes to 
reconstruct images of the objects themselves. Many bats emit frequency- 
modulated (FM) signals; the big brown bat, Eptesicus fuscus, transmits sounds 
with durations of several milliseconds containing frequencies from about 20 to 
100 kltz arranged in two or three harmonic sweeps (Fig. 1). The images that 
Eptesicus ultimately perceives retain crucial features of the original sonar wave-

forms, thus revealing how echoes are processed to reconstruct a display of the 
object itself. Several important general aspects of perception are embodied in 
specific echo-processing operations in the bat's sonar. By recognizing constraints 
imposed when echoes are encoded in terms of neural activity in the bat's auditory 
system, recent experiments have identified a novel use of time- and frequency- 
domain techniques as the basis for acoustic imaging in FM echolocation. The 
intrinsically reciprocal properties of time- and frequency-domain representations 
are exploited in the neural algorithms wlfich the bat uses to unify disparate 
features into whole images. 
IMAGES OF SINGI,E-GLINT 'FARGETS 
A simple sonar target consists of a single reflecting point, or glint, located at a 
discrete range and reflecting a single replica of the incident sonar signal. A 
complex target consists of several glints at slightly different ranges. It thus reflects 
compound echoes composed of individual replicas of the incident sound arriving

at slightly different delays. To determine the distance to a target, or target range, 
echolocating bats estimate the delay of echoes (Sinmons, 1989). The bat's image 
of a single-glint target is constructed around its estimate of echo delay, and the 
shape of the image can be measured behaviorally. The performance of bats 
trained to discriminate between echoes that jitter in delay and echoes that are 
stationary in delay yields a graph of the hnage itself (Altes, 1989), together with 
an indication of the accuracy of the delay estimate that underlies it (Simmons, 
1979; Simmons, Ferragamo, Moss, Stevenson, & Altos, in press). Fig. 2 shows

the image of a single-glint target perceived by Eptesicus, expressed in terms of 
echo delay (58 gsec/cm of range). From the bat's jitter discrimination 
performance, the target is perceived at its true range. Also, the image has a fine 
structure consisting of a central peak corresponding to the location of the target 
and two prominent side-peaks as ghost images located about 35 [tsec or 0.6 cxn 
nearer and farther than the main peak. This image fme structure reflects the 
composition of the waveform of the echoes themselves; it approximates the 
crosscorrelation function of echoes (Fig. 2). 
The discovery that the bat perceives an image corresponding to the cross- 
correlation function of echoes provides a view of the hidden machinery of the 
bat's sonar receiver. The bat's estimate of echo delay evidently is based upon a 
capacity of the auditory system to represent virtually all of the information 
available in echo waveforms that is relevant to determining delay, including the 
phase of echoes relative to emissions (Simnons, Ferragamo, et al, in press). The 
bat's initial auditory representation of these FM signals resembles spectragrams

pulse travels in a channel that is tuned to a particular excitatory frequency 
(Bodenhamer & Pollak, 1981) as a consequence of the fi'equency analyzing 
properties of the cochlea.. The cochlear filters are followed by rectification and 
low-pass filtering, so in a conventional sense the phase of the filtered signals is 
destroyed in the course of forming the spectrograms. Itowever, Fig. 2 shows that 
the bat is able to reconstruct the crosscorrelation function of echoes from its 
spcctrogram-like auditory representation. The individual neural ointsin the 
spectrogram signify instantaneous frequency, and the recovery of the fme 
structure in the image may exploit properties of instantaneous frequency when 
the images are assembled by integrating numerous separate delay measurements 
across different frequencies. The fact that the crosscorrelation function emerges 
from these neural computations is provocative from theoretical and technological 
viewpoints--the bat appears to employ novel real-time algorithms that can 
transform echoes into spectrograms and then into the sonar ambiguity function 
itself. 
The range-axis image of a single-glint target has a fine structure surrounding a 
central peak that constitutes the bat's estimate of echo tielay (Fig. 2). The width 
of this peak corresponds to the liniting accuracy of the bat's delay estimate, 
allowing for the ambiguity represented by the side-peaks located about 35 pscc 
away. In Fig. 2, tile data-points are spaced 5 psec apart along the time axis

bats can detect a shift of as little as 10 nsec as a hyperacuity (Altes, 1989) for 
echo delay in the jitter task. In estimating echo delay, the bat must integrate 
spectrogram delay estimates across separate frequencies in the FM sweeps of 
emissions and echoes (see Fig. 3), and it arrives at a very accurate composite 
estimate indeed. Timing accuracy in the nanosecond range is a previously 
unsuspected capability of the nervous system, and it is likely that more complex 
algorithms than just integration of information across frequencies lie behind this 
fine acuity (see below on amplitude-latency trading and perceived delay). 
IMAGES OF TWO-GLINT TARGETS 
Complex targets such as airborne insects reflect echoes composed of several 
replicas of the incident sound separated by short intervals of time (Simmons & 
Chen, 1989). For insect-sized targets, with dimensions of a few centimeters, this 
time separation of echo conponents is unlikely to exceed 100 to 150 [zsec. 
Because the bat's signals are several milliseconds long, the echoes from complex 
targets thus will contain echo components that largely overlap. The auditory 
system of Eptesicu, has an integration-time of about 350 lzsec for reception of 
sonar echoes (Simmons, Freedman, et aL, 1989). Two echo components that 
arrive together within this integration-time will merge together into a single 
compound echo having an arrival-time as a
