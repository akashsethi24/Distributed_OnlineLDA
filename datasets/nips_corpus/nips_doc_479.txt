Abstract 
Five experiments were performed using several neural network architectures to 
identify the location of a wave in the time ordered graphical results from a 
medical test. Baseline results from the first experiment found correct 
identification of the target wave in 85% of cases (n=20). Other experiments 
investigated the effect of different architectures and preprocessing the raw data on 
the results. The methods used seem most appropriate for time oriented graphical 
data which has a clear starting point such as electrophoresis or spectrometry 
rather than continuous tests such as ECGs and EEGs. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
Complex wave form recognition is generally considered to be a difficult task for 
machines. Analytical approaches to this problem have been described and they work with 
reasonable accuracy (Gabriel et al. 1980, Valdes-Sosa et al. 1987) The use of these 
techniques, however, requires substantial mathematical training and the process is often 
time consuming and labor intensive (Boston 1987). Mathematical modeling also requires 
substantial knowledge of the particular details of the wave forms in order to determine 
how to apply the models and to determine detection criteria. Rule-based expert systems 
have also been used for the recognition of wave forms (Boston 1989). They require that a 
knowledge engineer work closely with a domain expert to extract the rules that the expert 
uses to perform the recognition. If the rules are ad hoc or if it is difficult for experts to 
articulate the rules they use, then rule-based expert systems are cumbersome to 
implement. 
This paper describes the use of neural networks to recognize the location of peak V from 
the wave-form recording of brain stem auditory evoked potential tests. General 
discussions ofconnectionist networks can be found in (Rumelhart and McClelland 1986). 
The main features of neural networks that are relevant for our purposes revolve around 
their ease of use as compared to other modeling techniques. Neural networks provide 
several advantages over modeling with differential equations or rule-based systems. First, 
there is no knowledge engineering phase. The network is trained automatically using a 
series of examples along with the fight answer to each example. Second, the resulting 
network typically has significant predictive power when novel examples are presented. 
So, neural network technology allows expert performance to be mimicked without 
requiring that expert knowledge be codified in a traditional fashion. In addition, neural 
networks, when used to perform signal analysis, require vastly less restrictive

assumptions about the structure of the input signal than analytical techniques (Gorman 
and Sejnowski 1988). Still, neural nets have not yet been widely applied to problems of 
this sort (DeRoach 1989). Nevertheless, it seems that interest is growing in using 
computers, especially neural networks, to solve advanced problems in medical decision 
making (Stubbs 1988). 
1.1 BRAIN STEM AUDITORY EVOKED POTENTIAL (BAEP) 
Sensory evoked potentials are electric signals from the brain that occur in response to 
transient auditory, somatosensory, or visual stimuli such as a click, pinprick, or flash of 
light. The signals, recorded from electrodes placed on a subject's scalp, are a measure of 
the electrical activity in the subject's brain both from response to the stimulus and from 
the spontaneous electroencephalographic (EEG) activity of the brain. One way of 
discerning the response to the stimulus from the background EEG noise is to average the 
individual responses from many identical stimuli. When cortical noise has been 
removed in this way, evoked potentials can be an important noninvasive measure of 
central nervous system function. They are used in studies of physiology and psychology, 
for the diagnosis of neurologic disorders (Greenberg et al. 1981). Recently attention has 
focused on continuous automated monitoring of the BAEP intraoperatively as well as 
post-operatively for evaluation of central nervous system function (Moulton et al. 1991). 
Brain stem auditory evoked potentials (BAEP) are generated in the auditory pathways of 
the brain stem. They can be used to asses hearing and brain stem function even in 
unresponsive or uncooperative patients. 
The BAEP test involves placing headphones on the patient, flooding one ear with white 
noise, and delivering clicks into the other ear. Electrodes on the scalp both on the same 
side (ipsilateral) and opposite side (contralateral) of the clicks record the electric potentials 
of brain activity for 10 msec. following each click. In the protocol used at the University 
of Pittsburgh Presbyterian University Hospital (PUH), a series of 2000 clicks is delivered 
and the results from each click - a graph of electrode activitz over the 10 msec. - are 
averaged into a single graph. Results from the stimulation of one ear with the clicks is 
refened to as one ear of data. 
A graph of the wave form which results from the averaging of many stimuli appears as a 
series of peaks following the stimulus (Figure 1). The resulting graph typically has 7 
important peaks but often includes other peaks resulting from the noise which remains 
after averaging. Each important peak represents the firing of a group of neurons in the 
auditory neural pathway 1. The time of arrival of the peaks (the peak latencies) and the 
amplitudes of the peaks are used to characterize the response. The latencies of peaks I, Ill, 
and V are typically used to determine if there is evidence of slowed central nervous system 
conduction which is of value in the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis and other disease 
states 2. Conduction delay may be seen in the left, right, or both BAEP pathways. It is 
of interest that the time of arrival of a wave on the ipsilateral anti contralateral sides may 
be slightly different. This effect becomes more exagerated the more distant the correlated 
peaks are from the origin (Durrant, Boston, and Martin 1990). 
Typically there are several issues in the interpretation of the graphs. First, it must be 
clear that some neural response to the auditory stimulus is represented in the wave form. 
If a response is present, the peaks which correspond to normal and abnormal responses 
must be distinguished from noise which remains in the signal even after averaging. Wave

process. In these cases we say that wave V is absent. Finally, the latencies and possibly 
the amplitudes of the identified peaks are be measured and a diagnostic explanation for 
them is developed.

2 METHODS AND PROCEDURES 
2.1 DATA 
Plots of BAEP tests were obtained from the evoked potential files from the last 4 years at 
PUH. A preliminary group of training cases consisting of 13 patients or 26 ears was 
selected by traversing the files alphabetically from the beginning of the alphabet. This

group was subsequently extended to 25 patients or 50 ears, 39 normals and 11 abnormals. 
Most BAEP tests show no abnormalities; only 1 of the first 40 ears was abnormal. In 
order to create a training set with an adequate number of abnormal cases we included only 
patients with abnormal ears after these first 40 had been selected. Ten abnormal ears were 
obtained from a search of 60 patient f'des. Test cases were selected from files starting at 
the end of the alphabet, moving toward the beginning, the opposite of the process used 
for the training cases. Unlike the training set - where some cases were selected over 
others - all cases were included in the test set without bias. No cases were common to 
both sets. A total of 10 patients or 20 ears were selected. Table 1 summarizes the input 
For one of the experiments, another data set was made using the ipsilateral data for 80 
inputs and the derivative of the curve for the other 80 inputs. The derivative was 
computed by subtracting the amplitude of the point's successor from the amplitude of the 
point and dividing by 0.1. 
The ipsilateral and contralateral wave recordings were transformed to machine readable 
format by manual tracing with a BitPad Plus ï¿½ digitizer. A formal protocol was followed 
to ensure that a high fidelity transcription had been effected. The approximately 400 
points which resulted from the digitization of each ear were graphed and compared to the 
original tracings. If the tracings did not match, then the transcription was performed 
again. In addition, the originally recorded latency values for peak V were corrected for any 
distortion in the digitizing process. The distortion was judged by a neurologist to be 
minimal.
