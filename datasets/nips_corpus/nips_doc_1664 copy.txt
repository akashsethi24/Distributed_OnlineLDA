Abstract 
N wideband sources recorded using N closely spaced receivers can 
feasibly be separated based only on second order statistics when using 
a physical model of the mixing process. In this case we show that the 
parameter estimation problem can be essentially reduced to considering 
directions of arrival and attenuations of each signal. The paper presents 
two demixing methods operating in the time and frequency domain and 
experimentally shows that it is always possible to demix signals arriving at 
different angles. Moreover, one can use spatial cues to solve the channel 
selection problem and a post-processing Wiener filter to ameliorate the 
artifacts caused by demixing. 
1 Introduction 
Blind source separation (BSS) is capable of dramatic results when used to separate mixtures 
of independent signals. The method relies on simultaneous recordings of signals from two 
or more input sensors and separates the original sources purely on the basis of statistical 
independence between them. Unfortunately, BSS literature is primarily concerned with the 
idealistic instantaneous mixing model. 
In this paper, we formulate a low dimensional and fast solution to the problem of separating 
two signals from a mixture recorded using two closely spaced receivers. Using a physical 
model of the mixing process reduces the complexity of the model and allows one to identify 
and to invert the mixing process using second order statistics only. 
We describe the theoretical basis of the new approach, and then focus on two algorithms, 
which were implemented and successfully applied to extensive sets of real-world data. In 
essence, our separation architecture is a system of adaptive directional receivers designed 
using the principles of BSS. The method bears resemblance to methods in beamforming [8] 
in that it works by spatial filtering. Array processing techniques [2] reduce noise by 
separating signal space from noise space, which necessitates more receivers than emitters. 
The main differences are that standard beamforming and array processing techniques [8, 
2] are generally strictly concerned with processing directional narrowband signals. The 
difference with BSS [7, 6] is that our approach is model-based and therefore the elements 
of the mixing matrix are highly constrained: a feature that aids in the robust and reliable 
identification of the mixing process.

The layout of the paper is as follows. Sections 2 and 3 describe the theoretical foundation of 
the separation method that was pursued. Section 4 presents algorithms that were developed 
and experimental results. Finally we summarize and conclude this work. 
2 Theoretical foundation for the BSS solution 
As a first approximation to the general multi-path model, we use the delay-mixing model. 
In this model, only direct path signal components are considered. Signal components from 
one source arrive with a fractional delay between the time of arrivals at two receivers. By 
fractional delays, we mean that delays between receivers are not generally integer multiples 
of the sampling period. The delay depends on the position of the source with respect 
to the receiver axis and the distance between receivers. Our BSS algorithms demix by 
compensating for the fractional delays. This, in effect, is a form of adaptive beamforming 
with directional notches being placed in the direction of sources of interference [8]. A more 
detailed account of the analytical structure of the solutions can be found in [1]. 
Below we address the case of two inputs and two outputs but there is no reason why the 
discussion cannot be generalized to multiple inputs and multiple outputs. Assume a linear 
mixture of two sources, where source amplitude drops off in proportion to distance: 
sl(t- )+ s2(t ) (1) 
a:i(t)-- til c i2 c 
j = 1,2, where c is the speed of wave propagation, and trij indicates the distance from 
receiver i to source j. This describes signal propagation through a uniform non-dispersive 
medium. In the Fourier domain, Equation 1 results in a mixing matrix A(w) given by: 
c Rl2 '- 
A((.I.])--' 111  ,]O2 RII 
121 e . O2 JR21 _1 e__jOj 22 (2) 
c R22 c 
It is important to note that the columns can be scaled arbitrarily without affecting separation 
of sources because rescaling is absorbed into the sources. This implies that row scaling in 
the demixing matrix (the inverse of A(w)) is arbitrary. 
Using the Cosine Rule, tij can be expressed in terms of the distance/j of source j to 
the midpoint between two receivers, the direction of arrival of source j, and the distance 
between receivers, d, as follows: 
1 
Ris = + + i & cosOs (3) 
Expanding the right term above using the binomial expansion and preserving only zeroth 
and first order terms, we can express distance from the receivers to the sources as: 
RiS--(RS+8-----j)+(-1)i()cosOj (4) 
This approximation is valid within a 5% relative error when d _< __z. With the substitution 
for RiS and with the redefinition of source j to include the delay due to the term within 
brackets in Equation 4 divided by c, Equation 1 becomes: 
x(t) = t +(-1 . .cos0j ,i= 1,2 
$ 
In the Fourier domain, equation 5 results in the simplification to the mixing matrix A(w):

Here phases are functions of the directions of arrival 0j (defined with respect to the midpoint 
between receivers), the distance between receivers d, and the speed of propagation c: 
6i =  cos Oi, i = 1,2. Rij are unknown, but we can again redefine sources so diagonal 
elements are unity:

where c2, c2 are two positive real numbers. In wireless communications sources are 
typically distant compared to antenna distance. For distant sources and a well matched pair 
of receivers Cl m c2 m 1. Equation 7 describes the mixing matrix for the delay model in 
the frequency domain, in terms of four parameters, 62,62, c2, c2. 
The corresponding ideal demixing matrix W(w), for each frequency w, is given by: 
W(w) = [A(w)] -2 
1 [e/w62 -c2.e-J w*2 ] (8)

The outputs, estimating the sources, are: 
Z2(0d) X2(0d) : det A(oa) --C2 �jc�61 
Making the transition back to the time domain results in the following estimate of the 
outputs: 
Zl(t) ---- h(t 61 62, Cl,C2) Q _C2Xl( t_3_61)_3 _2(t_61)

H(w, 52,52, c2, c2) = det A(w) - eJ('2-1) - c2 c2 e -j(*2-*l) 
(11) 
Formulae 9 and 10 form the basis for two algorithms to be described next, in the time 
domain and the frequency domains. The algorithms have the role of determining the four 
unknown parameters. Note that the filter corresponding to H(w, 62,62, Cl, c2) should be 
applied to the output estimates in order to map back to the original inputs. 
3 Delay and attenuation compensation algorithms 
The estimation of the four unknown parameters 62, 62, Cl, C2 Can be carried out based on 
second order criteria that impose the constraint that outputs are decorrelated ([9, 4, 6, 5]). 
3.1 Time and frequency domain approaches 
The time domain algorithm is based on the idea of imposing the decorrelation constraint 
(z2 (t), z2(t)) = 0 between the estimates of the outputs, as a function of the delays D2 and 
D2 and scalar coefficients Cl and c2. This is equivalent to the following criterion: 
{ ]51, ]52, 6, 2 } -- argmin{F(D2,32, Cl, C2)) 
(12) 
where F(.) measures the cross-correlations between the signals given below, representing 
filtered versions of the differences of fractionally delayed measurements:

z2(t) = h(t, Dl, D2, cl, c2) � (c2xi(t + D2) - x2(t)) 
F(D1,D2, Cl,C2)-- (zi(t),z2(t)) 
(13) 
In the frequency domain, the cross-correlation of the inputs is expressed as follows: 
R x (a) = A(a)R s (w)A H (w) (14) 
The mixing matrix in the frequency domain has the form given in Equation 7. Inverting 
this cross correlation equation yields four equations that are written in matrix form as: 
R s(w) = A-'(w)R X (w)A- (w) (15) 
Source orthogonality implies that the off-diagonal terms in the covariance matrix must be 
zero: 
/f2 (CO)'-'0 (16) 
R() = 0 
For far field conditions (i.e. the distance between the receivers is much less than the distance 
from sources) one obtains the following equations: 
a 1 x 
b _a x c12 
/rl(W ) = Cl--/IX1 (W)- C2/22(W) --abR(w) R(w) = 0 
a ; 
The terms a = e-J*' and b -- e -j�*2 are functions of the time delays. Note that there is 
a pair of equations of this kind for each frequency. In practice, the unknowns should be 
estimated from data at all available frequencies to obtain a robust estimate. 
3.2 Channel selection 
Up to this point, there was no guarantee that estimated parameters would ensure source 
separation in some specific order. We could not decide a priori whether estimated parameters 
for the first output channel correspond to the first or second source. However, the dependence 
of the phase delays on the angles of arrival suggests a way to break the permutation symmetry 
in source estimation, that is to decide precisely which estimate to present on the first channel 
(and henceforth on the second channel as well). 
The core idea is that directionality and spatial cues provide the information required to 
break the symmetry. The criterion we use is to sort sources in order of increasing delay. 
Note that the correspondence between delay
