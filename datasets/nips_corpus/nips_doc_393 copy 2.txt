Abstract 
We have used a neural network to compute corrections for images written 
by electron beams to eliminate the proximity effects caused by electron 
scattering. Iterative methods are effective, but require prohibitively 
computation time. We have instead trained a neural network to perform 
equivalent corrections, resulting in a significant speed-up. We have 
examined hardware implementations using both analog and digital 
electronic networks. Both had an acceptably small error of 0.5% compared 
to the iterative results. Additionally, we verified that the neural network 
correctly generalized the solution of the problem to include patterns not 
contained in its training set. We have experimentally verified this approach 
on a Cambridge Instruments EBMF 10.5 exposure system. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
Scattering imposes limitations on the minimum feature sizes that can be reliably 
obtained with electron beam lithography. Linewidth corrections can be used to control 
the dimensions of isolated femures (i.e. intmproximity, Sewell, 1978), but meet with 
little success when dealing with the same features in a practical context, where they are 
surrounded by other features (i.e. interproximity). Local corrections have been 
proposed using a self-consistent method of computation for the desired incident dose 
pattern (Parikh, 1978). Such techniques require inversion of large matrices and 
prohibitive amounts of computation time. Lynch et al., 1982, have proposed an 
analytical method for proximity corrections based on a solution of a set of approximate 
equations, resulting in a considerable improvement in speed. 
The method that we present here, using a neural network, combines the computational 
simplicity of the method of Lynch et al. with the accuracy of the self-consistent 
methods. The first step is to determine the scattered energy profile of the electron 
beam which depends on the substrate structure, beam size and electron energy. This is

then used to compute spatial variations in the dosage that result when a particular 
image is scattered. This can be used to iteratively compute a corrected image for the 
input pattem. The goal of the correction is to adjust the written image so that the 
incident pattem of dose after scattering approximates the desired one as closely as 
possible. We have used this iterative method on a test image to form a training set for 
a neural network. The architecture of this network was chosen to incorporate the basic 
mathematical structure as the analytical method of Lynch et al., but relies on an 
adaptive procedure to determine its characteristic parameters. 
2 CALCULATING PROXIMITY CORRECTED PATTERNS 
We determined the radial distribution of scattered dose from a single pixel by using a 
Monte-Carlo simulation for a variety of substrates and electron beam energies 
(Cummings, 1989). As an example problem, we looked at resist on a heavy metal 
substrate. (These are of interest in the fabrication of masks for x-ray lithography.) For 
a 20 KeV electron beam this distribution, or proximity function, can be approximated 
by the analytical expression 
f(r) 1 e-(r/a? ve-(r/,) 
-- + + 
%(l+v+) at2 2y2 22 
where 
at = 0.038 gm, y = 0.045 gm,  = 0.36 gm, v = 3.49 and  = 6.42. 
The unscattered image is assumed to be composed of an array of pixels, I0(x,y). For a 
beam with a proximity function f(r) like the one given above, the image after scattering 
will be 
I0(x-m,y-n) f((m2+n2)'/'), 
which is the discrete convolution of the original image with the lineshape f(r). The 
approach suggested by analogy with signal processing is to deconvolve the image by 
an inverse filtering operation. This method cannot be used, however, because it is 
impossible to generate negative amounts of electron exposure. Restricting the beam to 
positive exposures makes the problem inherently nonlinear, and we must rely instead 
on an iterative, rather than analytical, solution. 
Figure 1 shows the pattern that we used to generate a training set for the neural 
network. This pattern was chosen to include examples of the kinds of features that are 
difficult to resolve because of proximity effects. Minimum feature sizes in the pattern 
ore 0.25gm and the overall image, using 0.125gm pixels, is 180 pixels (22.5t. tm) on a 
side, for a total of 32,400 pixels. The initial incident dose pattern for the iterative 
correction of this image started with a relative exposure value of 100% for exposed 
pixels and 0 for unexposed ones. The scattered intensity distribution was computed 
from this incident dose using the discrete two-dimensional convolution with the 
summation truncated to a finite range, r0. For the example proximity function 95% o[ 
the scattered intensity is contained within a radius of 1.125t. tm (9 pixels) and this 
value was used for r 0. The scattered intensity distribution was computed and compared 
with the desired pattern of 100% for exposed and 0 for unexposed pixels. The

difference between the resulting scattered and desired distributions is the error. This 
error was subtracted from the dose pattern to be used for the next iteration. However, 
since negative doses are not allowed, negative regions in the correction were truncated 
to zero.

Using this algorithm, a pixel that receives a dosage that is too small will have a 
negative error, and on the next iteration its intensity will be increased. Unexposed 
pixels (i.e. regions where resist is to be removed) will always have some dosage 
scattered into them from adjacent features, and will consequently always show a 
positive error. Because the written dose in these regions is always zero, rather than 
negative, it is impossible for the iterative solution to completely eliminate the error in 
the final scattered distribution. However, the nonlinear exposure properties of the resist 
will compensate for this. Moreover, since all exposed features receive a uniform dose 
after correction, it is possible to choose a resist with the optimal contrast properties for 
the pattern. 
Although this iterative method is effective, it is also time consuming. Each iteration on 
the test pattern required about 1 hour to run on a 386 based computer. Four iterations 
were required before the smallest features in the resist were properly resolved. Even 
the expected order of magnitude speed increase from a large mainframe computer is 
not sufficient to correct the image from a full sized chip consisting of several billion 
pixels. The purpose of the neural network is to do these same calculations, but in a 
much shorter time. 
3 NETWORK ARCHITECTURE AND TRAINING 
Figure 2 shows the relationship between the image being corrected and the neural 
network. The correction for one pixel takes into account the image surrounding it. 
Since the neighborhood must include all of the pixels that contribute appreciable 
scattered intensity to the central pixel being corrected, the size of the network was 
determined by the same maximum radius, r0 = 1.125grn, that characterized the 
scattering proximity function. The large number of inputs would be difficult to manage 
in an analog network if these inputs were general analog signals, but fortunately the 
input data are binary, and can be loaded into an analog network using digital shift 
registers.

Figure 3 shows a schematic diagram of the analog network. The binary signals from 
the shift registers representing a portion of the image were connected to the buffer 
amplifiers through 10 K.Q resistors. Each was connected to only one summing node, 
corresponding to its radial distance from the center pixel. This stage converted the 19 x 
19 binary representation of the image into 10 analog voltages that represented the 
radial distribution of the surrounding intensity. The summing amplifier at the output 
was connected to these 10 nodes by variable resistors. This resulted in an output that 
was a weighted sum of the radial components.

The prototype analog hardware network was built on a wire wrap board using 
74HC164 8 bit CMOS static shift registers and LM324 quad operational amplifiers for 
the active devices. The resistors in the first layer were 10 KII thin-film resistors in 
dual-in-line packages and had a tolerance of 1%. The ten adjustable resistors in the 
second layer of the network were 10 turn precision trimmers. Negative weights were 
made by inverting the sign of the voltage at the buffer amplifiers. For comparison, we
