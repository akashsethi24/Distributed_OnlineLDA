Abstract 
We introduce a neurobiologically plausible model of contour inte- 
gration from visual inputs of individual oriented edges. The model 
is composed of interacting excitatory neurons and inhibitory in- 
terneurons, receives visual inputs via oriented receptive fields (RFs) 
like those in V1. The RF centers are distributed in space. At each 
location, a finite number of cells tuned to orientations spanning 
180 � compose a model hypercolumn. Cortical interactions modify 
neural activities produced by visual inputs, selectively amplifying 
activities for edge elements belonging to smooth input contours. El- 
ements within one contour produce synchronized neural activities. 
We show analytically and empirically that contour enhancement 
and neural synchrony increase with contour length, smoothness 
and closure, as observed experimentally. This model gives testable 
predictions, and in addition, introduces a feedback mechanism al- 
lowing higher visual centers to enhance, suppress, and segment 
contours. 
1. Introduction 
The visual system must group local elements in its input into meaningful global 
features to infer the visual objects in the scene. Sometimes local features group into 
regions, as in texture segmentation; at other times they group into contours which 
may represent object boundaries. Although much is known about the processing 
steps that extract local features such as oriented input edges, it is still unclear how 
local features are grouped into global ones more meaningful for objects. In this

study, we model the neural mechanisms underlying the grouping of edge elements 
into contours -- contour integration. 
Recent psychophysical and physiological observations[14, 8] demonstrate a decrease 
in detection threshold of an edge element, by human observers or a primary cortical 
cell, if there are aligned neighboring edge elements. Changes in neural responses by 
visual stimuli presented outside their RFs have been observed physiologically[9, 8]. 
Human observers easily identify a smooth curve composed of individual, even dis- 
connected, Gabor edge elements distributed among many similar elements scat- 
tered in the background[4]. Horizontal neural connections observed in the primary 
visual cortex[5], and the finding that these connections preferably link cells tuned 
to similar orienations[5], provide a likely neural basis underlying the primitive vi- 
sual grouping phenomena such as contour integration. These findings suggest that 
simple and local neural interactions even in V1 could contribute to grouping. 
However, it has been difficult to model contour integration using only V1 elements 
and operation. Most existing models[15, 18] of contour integration lack well-founded 
biological bases. More neurally based models, e.g., the one by Grossberg and 
Mingolla[7], require operations beyond V1 or biologically questionable. It is thus 
desirable to find out whether contour enhancement can indeed occur within V1 or 
has to be attributed to top-down feedback. We introduce a V1 model of contour 
integration, using orientation selective cells, local cortical circuits, and horizontal 
connections. This model captures the essentials of the contour integration behavior. 
More details of the model can be found in a longer paper[12]. 
2. The Model 
2.1 Model outline 
K neuron pairs at each spatial location i model a hypercolumn in V1 (figure 1). 
Each neuron has a receptive field center i and an optimal orientation 0 - kr/K 
for k = 1, 2, ...K. A neuron pair consist of a connected excitatory neuron and 
inhibitory neuron which are denoted by indice (it)) for their receptive field center 
and preferred orientation, and are referred to as an edge segment. An edge segment 
receives the visual input via the excitatory cell, whose output quantifies the saliency 
of the edge segment and projects to higher visual centers. The inhibitory cells are 
treated as interneurons. When an input image contains an edge at i oriented at 0o, 
the edge segment it) receives input Ii0 ec b(0 -0o), where b(0) = e-101/(=/8) is a 
cell's orientation tuning curve.

Figure 2: Model neural connections and performance for contour enhancement and noise 
reduction. The top graph depicts connections Jio,jo, and Wio,jo, respectively between the 
center (white) horizontal edge and other edges. The whiteness and blackness of each edge 
is proportional to the connection sthength Jio,jo, and Wio,jo, respectively. The bottom 
row plots visual input and the maximum model outputs. The edge thickness in this row is 
proportional to the value of edge input or activity. The same format applies to the other 
figures in this paper. 
Let xio and yi be the cell membrane potentials for the excitatory and inhibitory 
cells respectively in the edge segment, then 
where gx (xio) and gy (YiO) are the firing rates from the excitatory and inhibitory cells 
respectively, 1/cx and 1/Cy are the membrane constants, Jo is the self-excitatory 
connection weight, Jio,jo, and Wio,jo, are synaptic weights between neurons, and Io 
and Ic are the background inputs to the excitatory and inhibitory cells. Without 
loss of generality, we take cz - cy = 1, gz (x) as threshold linear with saturation 
and an unit gain g (x) - I in the linear range. 
The synaptic connections Jio,jo' and Wio,j O, are local and translation and rotation 
invariant (Figure (2)). Jio,jo, increases with the smoothness (small curvature) of 
the curve that best connects (iO) and (jOt), and edge elements inhibit each other 
via Wio,jo, when they are alternative choices in a smooth curve route. Given an 
input pattern Iio, the network approaches a dynamic state after several membrane 
time constants. As in Figure (2), the neurons with relatively higher final activities 
are those belonging to smooth curves in the input. 
2.2 Model analysis 
Ignoring neural connections between edge segments, the neuron in edge segment it)

5gx(xo)/5Iio = I + g[(yo)g(xo)- Jog}(xo) (3) 
t t 
gy(Yo)g:r(Xo) 
5g(xo)/5Ic = 1+ g[(yo)g(Xo) - Jog}(xo) (4) 
where g(Xo) and gy(Yo) are roughly the average neural activities (omitting iO for 
simplicity). Thus the edge activity increases with Iio and decreases with Ic (in cases 
t t t 
that interest us, gy (Yo)g (Xo) > Jog (Xo) - 1). The resulting input-output function 
given Ic, gx(Xo) vs. Iio, corresponds well with physiological data. 
By effectively increasing Iio or I�, the edge element (jO ) can excite or inhibit the 
element (iO) with excitatory-to-excitatory input Jio,jo, g(xjo,) and excitatory-to- 
inhibitory input Wiojo,g(xjo,) respectively. Contour enhancement is so (Fig. 2) 
achieved. In the simplest example when the visual input has equally spaced equal 
strength edges from a line and all other edge segments are silent, we can treat the 
line system as one dimensional, omit 0 and take i as locations along the line. A lack 
of inhibition between line segments gives: 
5ci = -omxi - gy(yi) + Jogm(xi) +  Jijgx(xj) + Io + Iti,,-i,put (5) 
jgi 
= + g(xd + (6) 
If line is infinite, by symmetry, each edge segment has the same average activity 
g(xi)  g(Xo) for all i. This system can then be seen[12] either as a giant edge 
with self-excitatory connection (Jo + Y].jgi Jij), or a single edge with extra external 
input AI = (Y'].jgi Jij)g(Xo). Either way, activities gx(xo) are enhanced for each 
edge element in the line (figure 3 and 2). 
This analysis is also applicable to constant curvature curves[12]. It can be shown 
that, in the linear range of g 0, the response ratio between a curve segment and an 
isolated segment is (g;(Yo) + 1 - Jo)/(g;(Yo) + 1 - Jo - Y'.igj Jij). Since Eij Jij 
decreases with increasing curvature, so does the response enhancement. Translation 
invariance along the curve breaks down in a finite length curve near its two ends, 
where activity enhancement decays by a decreased excitation from fewer neighboring 
segments. This suggests that a closed or longer curve has higher saliency than an 
open or shorter one (figure (3)). This prediction is expected to hold also for curves 
of non-constant curvature, and should play a significant role in the psychophysical 
observation[lO] showing a decreased detection threshold for closed curves from that 
of the open ones. 
Further analysis[12] shows that the edge segments in a curve normally exhibit neural 
oscillations around their mean activity levels with near-zero phase delays from each 
other. The model predicts that, like the contour enhancement, the oscillation is 
stronger for
