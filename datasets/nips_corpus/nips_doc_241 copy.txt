ABSTRACT 
Traditional inethods of studying neural coding characterize the cn- 
coding of known stimuli in average neural responses. Organisms 
face nearly the opposite task -- decoding short segments of a spike 
train to extract information about an unknown, time-varying stim- 
ulus. Here we present strategies for characterizing the neural code 
from the point of view of the organism, culminating in algorithms 
for real-time stimulus reconstruction based on a single sample of 
the spike train. These methods are applied to the design and anal- 
ysis of experiments on an identified movement-sensitive neuron in 
the fly visual system. As far as we know this is the first instance in 
which a direct reading of the neural code has been accomplished. 
1 Introduction 
Sensory systems receive information at extremely high rates, and much of this infor- 
mation must be processed in real time. To understand real-time signal processing 
in biological systems we must understand the representation of this information in 
neural spike trains. We ask several questions in particular: 
Does a single neuron signal only the occurrence of particular stimulus fea- 
tures, or can the spike train represent a continuous time-varying input?

How much information is carried by the spike train of a single neuron? 
Is the reliability of the encoded signal limited by noise at the sensory input 
or by noise and inefficiencies in the subsequent layers of neural processing? 
Is the neural code robust to errors in spike timing, or do realistic levels of 
synaptic noise place significant limits on information transmission? 
Do simple analog computations on the encoded signals correspond to simple 
manipulations of the spike trains? 
Although neural coding has been studied for more than fifty years, clear experimen- 
tal answers to these questions have been elusive (Perkel & Bullock, 1968; de Ruyter 
van Steveninck & Bialek, 1988). Here we present a new approach to the characteri- 
zation of the neural code which provides explicit and sometimes surprising answers 
to these questions when applied to an identified movement-sensitive neuron in the 
fly visual system. 
We approach the study of spiking neurons from the point of view of the organism, 
which, based only on the spike train, must estimate properties of an unknown time- 
varying stimulus. Specifically we try to solve the problem of decoding the spike train 
to recover the stimulus in real time. As far as we know our work is the first instance 
in which it has been possible to read the neural code in this literal sense. Once 
we can read the code, we can address the questions posed above. In this paper we 
focus on the code reading algorithm, briefly summarizing the results which follow. 
2 Theoretical background 
The traditional approach to the study of neural coding characterizes the encoding 
process: For an arbitrary stimulus waveform s(r), what can we predict about the 
spike train? This process is completely specified by the conditional probability 
distribution P[{t,}ls(r)] of the spike arrival times {ti} conditional on the stimulus 
s(r). In practice one cannot characterize this distribution in its entirety; most 
experiments result in only the lowest moment -- the firing rate as function of time 
given the stimulus. 
The classic experiments of Adrian and others established that, for static stimuli, the 
resulting constant firing rate provides a measure of stimulus strength. This concept 
is easily extended to any stimulus waveform which is characterized by constant 
parameters, such as a single frequency or fixed amplitude sine wave. Much of the 
effort in studying the encoding of sensory signals in the nervous system thus reduces 
to probing the relation between these stimulus parameters and the resulting firing 
rate. Generalizations to time-varying firing rates, especially in response to periodic 
signals, have also been explored. 
The firing rate is a continuous function of time which measures the probability 
per unit time that the cell will generate a spike. The rate is thus by definition 
an average quantity; it is not a property of a single spike train. The rate can 
be estimated, in principle, by averaging over a large ensemble of redundant cells, 
38 Bialek, Rieke, van Steveninck and Warland 
or by averaging responses of a single cell over repeated presentations of the same 
stimulus. This latter approach dominates the experimental study of spiking neurons. 
Measurements of firing rate rely on some form of redundancy -- either the spatial 
redundancy of identical cells or the temporal redundancy of repeated stimuli. It is 
simply not clear that such redundancy exists in real sensory systems under natural 
stimulus conditions. In the absence of redundancy a characterization of neural 
responses in terms of firing rate is of little relevance to the signal processing problems 
faced by the organism. To say that information is coded in firing rates is of no 
use unless one can explain how the organism could estimate these firing rates by 
observing the spike trains of its own neurons. 
We believe that none of the existing approaches 2 to neural coding addresses the basic 
problem of reaLtime signal processing with neural spike trains: The organism must 
extract information about continuously varying stimulus waveforms using only the 
discrete sequences of spikes. Real-time signal processing with neural spike trains 
thus involves some sort of interpolation between the spikes that allows the organism 
to estimate a continuous function of time. 
The most basic problem of real-time signal processing is to decode the spike train and 
recover an estimate of the stimulus waveform itself. Clearly if we can accomplish 
this task then we can begin to understand how spike trains can be manipulated to 
perform more complex computations; we can also address the quantitative issues 
outlined in the Introduction. Because of the need to interpolate between spikes, 
such decoding is not a simple matter of inverting the conventional stimulus-response 
(rate) relations. In fact it is not obvious a priori that true decoding is even possible. 
One approach to the decoding problem is to construct models of the encoding 
process, and proceed analytically to develop algorithms for decoding within the 
context of the model (Bialek & Zee, 1990). Using the results of this approach we 
can predict that linear filtering will, under some conditions, be an effective decoding 
algorithm, and we can determine the form of the filter itself. In this paper we have 
a more limited goal, namely to see if the class of decoding algorithms identified 
by Bialek and Zee is applicable to a real neuron. To this end we will treat the 
structure of the decoding filter as unknown, and find the best filter under given 
experimental conditions. 
We imagine building a set of (generally non-linear) filters {F,} which operate on 
the spike train to produce an estimate of the stimulus. If the spikes arrive at times 
{ti}, we write our estimate of the signal as a generalized convolution,

2Higher moments of the conditional probability P[{t i}ls(r)], such as the inter-spike interval 
distribution (Perkel & Bullock, 1968) are also average properties, not properties of single spike 
trains, and hence may not be relevant to real-time signal processing. White-noise methods (Mar- 
marelis & Marmarelis, 1978) result in models which predict the time-varying firing rate in response 
to arbitrary input waveforms and thus suffer the same limitations as other rate-based approaches.

How good are the reconstructions? We separate systematic and random errors by 
introducing a frequency dependent gain g(a) such that /Ig(a)l) = g(a)/Igeo,(a)l ). 
The rcsulting gain is approximately unity through a reasonable bandwidth. Further, 
the distribution of deviations between the stimulus and reconstruction is approx- 
imately Gaussian. The absence of systematic errors suggests that non-linearities 
in the reconstruction filter are unlikely to help. Indeed, the contribution from the 
st ond order term in Eq. (1) to the reconstructions is negligible.

curve). By multiplying the displacement noise level by a bandwidth, we obtain the 
square of the angular resolution of H1 for a step displacement. For a reasonable 
bandwidth the resolution is much less than the photoreceptor spacing, 1.35 o -- 
hyperacuity. Also shown is the limit to the resolution of small displacements set 
by noise in the photoreceptor array (lower curve). 
We identify the noise at frequency w as the difference between the stimulus and 
the normalized reconstruction, fi(a) - (a)- g(co)e,t(CO). We then compute the 
pectral density (noise power per unit bandwidth) of the displacement noise (Fig 2). 
The noise level achieved in H 1 is astonishing; with a one second integration time an 
observer of the spike train in H1 could judge the amplitude of a low frequency dither 
to 0.01 ï¿½ -- more than one hundred times less than the photoreceptor spacing! If the
