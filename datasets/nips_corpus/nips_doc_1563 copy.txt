Abstract 
In High Energy Physics experiments one has to sort through a high 
flux of events, at a rate of tens of MHz, and select the few that are 
of interest. One of the key factors in making this decision is the 
location of the vertex where the interaction, that led to the event, 
took place. Here we present a novel solution to the problem of 
finding the location of the vertex, based on two feedforward neu- 
ral networks with fixed architectures, whose parameters are chosen 
so as to obtain a high accuracy. The system is tested on simu- 
lated data sets, and is shown to perform better than conventional 
algorithms. 
I Introduction 
An event in High Energy Physics (HEP) is the experimental result of an interaction 
during the collision of particles in an accelerator. The result of this interaction is 
the production of tens of particles, each of which is ejected in a different direction 
and energy. Due to the quantum mechanical effects involved, the events differ from 
one another in the number of particles produced, the types of particles, and their 
energies. The trajectories of produced particles are detected by a very large and 
sophisticated detector.

Events are typically produced at a rate of 10 MHz, in conjunction with a data 
volume of up to 500 kBytes per event. The signal is very small, and is selected from 
the background by multilevel triggers that perform filtering either through hardware 
or software. In the present paper we confront one problem that is of interest in these 
experiments and is part of the triggering consideration. This is the location of the 
vertex of the interaction. To be specific we will use a simulation of data collected by 
the central tracking detector [1] of the ZEUS experiment [2] at the HEP laboratory 
DESY in Hamburg, Germany. This detector, placed in a magnetic field, surrounds 
the interaction point and is sensitive to the path of charged particles. It has a 
cylindrical shape around the axis, z, where the interaction between the incoming 
particles takes place. The challenge is to find an efficient and fast method to extract 
the exact location of the vertex along this axis. 
2 The Input Data 
An example of an event, projected onto the z - 0 plane, is shown in Figure 1. Only 
the information relevant to triggering is used and displayed. The relevant points, 
which denote hits by the outgoing particles on wires in the detector, form five rings 
due to the concentric structure of the detector. Several slightly curved particle 
tracks emanating from the origin, which is marked with a q- sign, and crossing 
all five rings, can easily be seen. Each track is made of 30-40 data points. All 
tracks appear in this projection as arcs, and indeed, when viewed in 3 dimensions, 
every particle follows a helical trajectory due to the solenoidal magnetic field in the 
detector.

Figure 1: A typical event projected onto the z - 0 plane. The dots, or hits, have 
a two-fold ambiguity in the determination of the xy coordinates through which the 
particle has moved. The correct solutions lie on curved tracks that emanate from 
the origin. 
Each physical hit is represented twice in Fig. 1 due to an inherent two-fold ambiguity 
in the determination of its xy coordinates. The correct solutions form curved tracks 
emanating from the origin. Some of those can be readily seen in the data. Due to 
the limited time available for decision making at the trigger level, the z coordinate 
is obtained from the difference in arrival times of a pulse at both ends of the CTD 
and is available for only a fraction of these points. The hit resolution in xy is 
 230 tzm, while that of z-by-timing is _ 4 cm. The quality of the z coordinate

information is exemplified in figure 2. Figure 2(a) shows points forming a track of 
a single particle on the z = 0 projection. Since the corresponding track forms a 
helix with small curvature, one expects a linear dependence of the z coordinate of 
the hits on their radial position, r = V/X 2 + y2. Figure 2(b) compares the values of 
r with the measured z values for these points. The scatter of the data around the 
linear regression fit is considerable.

3 The Network 
Our network is based on step-wise changes in the representation of the data, moving 
from the input points, to local line segments and to global arcs. The nature of 
the data and the problem suggest it is best to separate the treatment of the xy 
coordinates from that of the z coordinate. Two parallel networks which perform 
entirely different computations, form our final system. The first network, which 
handles the xy information is responsible for constructing arcs that correctly identify 
some of the particle tracks in the event. The second network uses this inforrnation 
to evaluate the z location of the point where all tracks meet. 
3.1 Arc Identification Network 
The arc identification network processes information in a fashion akin to the method 
visual information is processed by the primary visual system [3]. 
The input layer for this network is made of a large number of neurons (several tens 
of thousands) and corresponds to the function of the retina. Each input neuron 
has its distinct receptive field. The sum of all fields covers completely the relevant 
domain in the xy plane. This domain has 5 concentric rings, which show up in 
figure 1. The total area of the rings is about 5000 cm 2, and covering it with 100000 
input neurons leads to satisfactory resolution. A neuron in the input level fires 
when a hit is present in its receptive field. We shall label each input neuron by the 
(xy) coordinates of the center of its receptive field. 
Neurons of the second layer are line segment detectors. Each second layer neuron 
is labeled by (XYc), where (X, Y) are the coordinates of the center of the segment

and g(x) is the standard Heaviside step function. ql and r� are the parallel and 
perpendicular distances between (X, Y) and (x, y) with respect to the axis of the 
line segment, defined by c. It is important to note that at this level, values of the 
threshold 02 which are slightly lower than optimum are preferable, taking the risk 
of obtaining superfluous line segments in order to reduce the probability of missing 
one. Superfluous line segments are filtered out very efficiently in higher layers� 
Figure 3 represents the output of the second layer neurons for the input illustrated 
by the event of figure 1. An active second layer neuron (XYo) is represented in 
this figure by a line segment centered at the point (X, Y) making an angle c with 
the x axis. The length of the line segments is immaterial and was chosen only for 
the purpose of visual clarity.

Figure 3: Representation of the activity of second layer neurons XYo for the input 
of figure 1 taken by plotting the appropriate line segments in the xy plane. At some 
XY locations several line segments with different directions occur due to the rather 
low threshold parameter used, 02 = 4. 
Neurons of the third layer transform the representation of local line segments into 
local arc segments. An arc which passes through the origin is uniquely defined by 
its radius of curvature R and its slope at the origin. Thus, each third layer neuron 
is labeled by , 0 i, where Inl - 1/R is the curvature and the sign of , determines 
the orientation of the arc. 1 _ i _ 5 is an index which relates each arc segment to 
the ring it belongs to. 
The mapping between second and third layers is based on a winner-take-all mech- 
anism. Namely, for a given local arc segment, we take the arc segment which is 
closest to being tangent to the local arc segment.

where 5 = 5(X, Y, n, O, i) = v/(X - ri cos(0 - i))2 + (y _ ri sin(0 - i))2 is simply 
the distance of the center of the receptive field of the (XYa) neuron to the 
arc. 
The fourth layer is the last one in the arc identification network. Neurons belonging 
to this layer are global arc detectors. In other words, they detect projected tracks 
on the z - 0 plane. A fourth level neuron is denoted by nO , where n and 0 have the 
previous meaning, now describing global arcs. Fourth layer neurons are connected 
to third layer neurons in a simple fashion, 
Vo = g(Y 8,,8o,o,V,o,i - 04). (4) 
Figure 4 represents the activity of fourth layer neurons. Each active neuron n0 is 
equivalent in the xy plane to one arc appearing in the figure.
