Abstract 
Binocular rivalry is the alternating percept that can result when 
the two eyes see different scenes. Recent psychophysical evidence 
supports an account for one component of binocular rivalry similar 
to that for other bistable percepts. We test the hypothesis 19,16.18 
that alternation can be generated by competition between top- 
down cortical explanations for the inputs, rather than by direct 
competition between the inputs. Recent neurophysiological ev- 
idence shows that some binocular neurons are modulated with 
the changing percept; others are not, even if they are selective be- 
tween the stimuli presented to the eyes. We extend our model to 
a hierarchy to address these effects. 
1 Introduction 
Although binocular rivalry leads to distinct perceptual distress, it is revealing 
about the mechanisms of visual information processing. The first accounts for 
rivalry argued on the basis of phenomena such as increases in thresholds for test 
stimuli presented in the suppressed eye 24' 8, 3 that there was a early competitive 
process, the outcome of which meant that the system would just ignore input 
from one eye in favour of the other. Various experiments have suggested that 
simple input competition cannot be the whole story. For instance, in a case in 
which rivalry is between a vertical grating in the left eye and a horizontal one 
in the right, and in which a vertical grating is presented prior to rivalry to cause 
adaptation, the relative suppression of vertical during rivalry is independent of

the eye of origin of the adapting grating. 4 Even more compelling, if the rivalrous 
stimuli in the two eyes are switched rapidly, the percept switches only slowly - 
competition is more between coherent percepts than merely inputs. Rivalry is an 
attractive paradigm for studying models of cortex like the Helmholtz machine 12, 7 
that construct coherent percepts, and in particular for studying hierarchical models, 
because of electrophysiological data on the behaviour during rivalry of cells at 
different levels of the visual processing hierarchy. 16 
Leopold & Logothetis 16 trained monkeys to report their percepts during rivalrous 
and non-rivalrous stimuli whilst recording from neurons V1/2 and V4. Important 
findings are that striate monocular neurons are unaffected by rivalry; some striate 
binocular neurons that are selective between the stimuli modulate their activities 
during rivalry; others do not; some fire more when their preferred stimuli are 
suppressed; others still are only selective during rivalry. In this paper we consider 
one form of analysis-by-synthesis model of cortical processing 7 and show how it 
can exhibit rivalry between explanations in the case that the eyes receive different 
input. This model can provide an account for many of the behaviours described 
above. 
2 The Model 
Figure la shows the full generarive model. Units in layers y (modeling V1) and 
x and w (modeling early and late extra-striate areas) are all binocular and jointly 
explain successively more complex features in the input z according to a top-down 
generarive model. Apart from the half bars in y, the model is similar to that 
learned by the Helmholtz machine 12, 7for which increasing complexity in higher 
layers rather than the increasing input scale is key. In this case, for instance, w2 
specifies the occurrence of vertical bars anywhere in the 8 x 8 input grids; a:la 
specifies the rightmost vertical bar; and tsl and ts2 the top and bottom half of this 
vertical bar. These specifications are provided by a top-down genera five model in 
which the activations of units are specified by probabilities such as/v[/]i = l lx ] = 
cr (b v + -k a:kJ) where the sum k is over all the units in the x layer, and or() 
is a robust normal distribution function. We model the percept in terms of the 
activation in the w layer. 
We model differing input contrasts by representing the input to zi by di, where 
tv[zi = 1] = cr(di) and all the zi are independent. Recognition is formally the sta- 
tistical inverse to generation, and should produce distribution/V[w, x, yl d] over all 
the choices of the hidden activations. We use a mean field inversion method, is 
using a factorised approximation Q[w,x, y;/, , O] = Q[w;/]Q][x; ]Q[y; 0], with 
Q[w;/] = 1-Ii cr(/i) wi (1 - cr(/i)) 1-wi, etc, and fitting the parameters/, , 0 to min- 
imise the approximation cost: 
We report the mean activities of the units in the graphs and use a modified gradient 
descent method to find appropriate parameters. Figure lb shows the resulting 
activities of units in response to binocular horizontal (i) and vertical (i_i) bars, and 
also the two equally likely explanations for rivalrous input (iii and iv). For rivalry,

Figure 1: a) Hierarchical generative model for 8 x 8 bar patterns across the two eyes. Units are 
depicted by their net projective (generafive) fields, and characteristic weights are shown. Even though 
the net projective field of a: is the top horizontal bar in both eyes, note that it generates this by increasing 
the probability that units yl and y0 in the y layer will be active, not by having direct connections to 
the input z. Unit w connects to a:l, a:.,... a:s through Jwx = 0.8; a:6 connects to yal, Y3. through 
dxy = 1.0 and Ya. connects to the bottom right half vertical bar through dy,. = 5.8. Biases are 
bw = -0.75, bx = -1.5, by = -2.7 and b,. = -3.3. b) Recognition activity in the network for four 
different input patterns. The units are arranged in the same order as (a), and white and black squares 
imply activities for the units whose means are less than and greater than 0.5. (i) and (ii) represent normal 
binocular stimulation; (iii) and (iv) show the two alternative stable states during rivalrous stimulation, 
without the fatigue process. 
there is direct competition in the top left hand quadrant of z, which is reflected in the 
competition between g/i, ya and g/17, g/.x. However, the input regions (top right of L 
and bottom left of R) for which there is no competition, require the constant activity 
of explanations g/9, g/ix, g/18 and g/2.. Under the generative model, the coactivation 
of yl and Y9 without Ig I is quite unlikely (D[X 1 -' 0[yx = 1, Y3 -- 1] = 0.1), which is 
why IgX, 115 3 and also Wx become active with yx and y3. 
Given just gradient descent for the rivalrous stimulus, the network would just find 
one of the two equally good (or rather bad) solutions in figure lb(iii, iv). Alternation 
ensues when descent is augmented by a fatigue process: 
bl(t + 1) = bl(t) + 5(-VpY[/,, b] + ct(/bl(t)) - b (t)) 
b (t + 1) = b (t) + ((b I (t) -- jb (t)), 
where/ is a decay term. In all the simulations, c =0.5,/=0.1 and 4=0.01. 
We adopted various heuristics to simplify the process of using this rather cumber- 
some mean field model. First, fatigue is only implemented for the units in the y

layer, and the %b follow the equivalent of the dynamical equations above. Although 
adaptation processes can clearly occur at many levels in the system, and indeed 
have been used to try to diagnose the mechanisms of rivalryfi 5 their exact form is 
not clear. Bialek & DeWeese 1 argue that the rate of a switching process should be 
adaptive to the expected rate of change of the associated signal on the basis of prior 
observations. This is clearly faster nearer to the input. 
The second heuristic is that rather than perform gradient descent for the non- 
fatiguing units, the optimal values of/2 and  are calculated on each iteration by 
solving numerically equations such as 
ï¿½] =o. 
The dearth of connections in the network of figure la allows/2 and  to be calculated 
locally at each unit in an efficient manner. Whether this is reasonable depends on 
the time constants of settling in the mean field model with respect to the dynamics 
of switching, and, more particularly on the way that this deterministic model is 
made appropriately stochastic. 
Figure 2a shows the resulting activities during rivalry of units at various levels of 
the hierarchy including the fatigue process. Broadly, the competing explanations 
in figure lb(iii;iv), ie horizontal and vertical percepts, alternate, and units without 
competing inputs, such as /9, are much less modulated than the others, such as /1. 
The activity of /9 is slightly elevated when horizontal bars are dominant, based on 
top-down connections. The activities of the units higher up, such as a:l and wl, do 
not decrease to 0 during the suppression period for horizontal bars, leaving weak 
activity during suppression. Many of the modulating cells in monkeys were not 
completely silent during their periods of less activity? Figure 2b shows that the 
hierarchical version of the model also behaves in accordance with experimental 
results on the effects of varying the input contrastfi 7' 10, 9.2,16 which suggest that 
increasing the contrast in both eyes decreases the period of the oscillation (ie in- 
creases the frequency), and increasing the contrast in just one eye decreases the 
suppression period for that eye much more than it increases its dominance period.

Following Logothetis and his colleagues 1,16,18 (see also Grossberg it) we have 
suggested an account of rivalry based on competing top-dow
