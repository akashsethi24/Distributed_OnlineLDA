Abstract 
Flies are capable of rapidly detecting and integrating visual motion in- 
formation in behaviorly-relevant ways. The first stage of visual motion 
processing in flies is a retinotopic array of functional units known as el- 
ementary motion detectors (EMDs). Several decades ago, Reichardt and 
colleagues developed a correlation-based model of motion detection that 
described the behavior of these neural circuits. We have implemented a 
variant of this model in a 2.0-/tin analog CMOS VLSI process. The re- 
sult is a low-power, continuous-time analog circuit with integrated pho- 
toreceptors that responds to motion in real time. The responses of the 
circuit to drifting sinusoidal gratings qualitatively resemble the temporal 
frequency response, spatial frequency response, and direction selectivity 
of motion-sensitive neurons observed in insects. In addition to its pos- 
sible engineering applications, the circuit could potentially be used as a 
building block for constructing hardware models of higher-level insect 
motion integration. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
Flies rely heavily on visual motion information to survive. In the fly, motion information is 
known to underlie many important behaviors including stabilization during flight, orienting 
towards small, rapidly-moving objects (Egelhaaf and Borst 1993), and estimating time-to- 
contact for safe landings (Borst and Bahde 1988). Some motion-related tasks like extending 
the legs for landing can be excecuted less than 70 milliseconds after stimulus presentation. 
The computational machinery performing this sensory processing is fast, small, low-power, 
and robust. 
There is good evidence that motion information is first extracted by local elementary mo- 
tion detectors (see Egelhaaf et al. 1988 and references therein). These EMDs are ar-

ranged retinotopically, and receive input from adjacent photoreceptors. The properties of 
these motion-sensitive units have been studied extensively during the past 30 years. Direct 
recording from individual EMDs is difficult due to the small size of the cells, but much 
work has been done recording from large tangential cells that integrate the outputs of many 
EMDs over large portions of the visual field. From these studies, the behavior of individual 
EMDs has been inferred. 
If we wish to study models of motion integration in the fly, we first need a model of the 
EMD. Since many motion integration neurons in the fly are only a few synapses away 
from muscles, it may be possible in the near future to contract models that complete the 
sensorimotor loop. If we wish to include the real world in the loop, we need a mobile 
system that works in real time. In the pursuit of such a system, we follow the neuromorphic 
engineering approach pioneered by Mead (Mead 1989) and implement a hardware model of 
the fly EMD in a commercially available 2.0-m CMOS VLSI process. All data presented 
in this paper are from one such chip. 
2 ALGORITHM AND ARCHITECTURE 
Figure 1 a shows a simplified version of the motion detector. This is an elaborated version of 
the correlation-based motion detector first proposed by Reichardt and colleagues (see Re- 
ichardt 1987 and references therein). The Reichardt motion detector works by correlating 
(by means of a multiplication) the response of one photoreceptor to the delayed response 
of an adjacent photoreceptor. Our model uses the phase lag inherent in a low-pass filter 
to supply the delay. The outputs from two mirror-symmetric correlators are subtracted to 
remove any response to full-field flicker (ws = 0, wt > 0). 
Correlation-based EMDs are not pure velocity sensors. Their response is strongly affected 
by the contrast and the spatial frequency components of the stimulating pattern. They 
can best be described as direction-selective spatiotemporal filters. The mean steady-state 
response R of the motion detector shown in Figure 1 a to a sinusoidal grating drifting in one 
direction can be expressed as a separable function of stimulus amplitude (AI), temporal

order low-pass filter inherent in the photoreceptor, this forms the high-pass filter with time

needed for the nFET or pFET source follower to charge or discharge the capacitor U.

frequency (cot = 27rft), and spatial frequency (co, = 27r f,): 
where Aq is the angular separation of the photoreceptors, r is the time constant of the 
high-pass filter, and r� is the time constant of the low-pass filter (see Figure 1 a). (Note 
that this holds only for motion in a particular direction. Motion detectors are not linearly 
separable overall, but the single-direction analysis is useful for making comparisons.) 
3 CIRCUIT DESCRIPTION 
In addition to the basic Reichardt model described above, we include a high-pass filter in 
series with the photoreceptor. This amplifies transient responses and removes the DC com- 
ponent of the photoreceptor signal. We primarily use the high-pass filter as a convenient 
circuit to switch from a voltage-mode to a current-mode representation (see Figure 2a). 
For the photoreceptor, we use an adaptive circuit developed by Delbrfick (Delbrfick and 
Mead 1996) that produces an output voltage proportional to log intensity. We bias the pho- 
toreceptor very weakly to attenuate high temporal frequencies. This is directly followed by 
a temporal derivative circuit (Mead 1989) (see Figure 2a), the result being a high-pass filter 
with the dominant pole r being set by the photoreceptor cutoff frequency. The outputs 
of the temporal derivative circuit are two unidirectional currents that represent the positive 
and negative components of a high-pass filtered version of the photoreceptor output. This 
resembles the ON and OFF channels found in many biological visual systems. Some stud- 
ies suggest ON and OFF channels are present in the fly (Franceschini et al. 1989) but the 
evidence is mixed (Egelhaafand Borst 1992). This two-channel representation is useful for 
current-mode circuits, since the following translinear circuits work only with unidirectional

currents. It should be noted that the use of ON and OFF channels introduces nonlinearities 
into the circuit that are not accounted for in the simple model described by Equation 2. 
The current-mode low-pass filter is shown in Figure 2b. The time constant rt is set by the 
bias current I-. This is a log-domain filter that takes advantage of the exponential behavior 
of field-effect transistors (FETs) in the subthreshold region of operation (Minch, personal 
communication). 
The current-mode multiplier is shown in Figure 2c. This circuit is also translinear, using a 
diode-connected FET to convert the input currents into log-encoded voltages. A weighted 
sum of the voltages is computed with a capacitive divider, and the resulting voltage is 
exponentiated by the output FET into the output current. The capacitive divider creates 
a floating node, and the charge on all these nodes must be equalized to ensure matching 
across independent multipliers. This is easily accomplished by exposing the chip to UV 
light for several minutes. This circuit represents one of a family of floating-gate MOS 
translinear circuits developed by Minch that are capable of computing arbitrary power laws 
in current mode (Minch et al. 1996). 
After the multiplication stage, the currents from the ON and OFF channels are summed, 
and the final subtraction of the left and right channels is done off-chip. There is a gain 
mismatch of approximately 2.5 between the left and right channels that is now compensated
