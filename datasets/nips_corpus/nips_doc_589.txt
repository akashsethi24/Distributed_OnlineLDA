Abstract 
Channel equalization problem is an important problem in high-speed 
communications. The sequences of symbols transmitted are distorted by 
neighboring symbols. Traditionally, the channel equalization problem is 
considered as a channel-inversion operation. One problem of this 
approach is that there is no direct correspondence between error proba- 
bility and residual error produced by the channel inversion operation. In 
this paper, the optimal equalizer design is formulated as a classification 
problem. The optimal classifier can be constructed by Bayes decision 
rule. In general it is nonlinear. An efficient hybrid linear/nonlinear 
equalizer approach has been proposed to train the equalizer. The error 
probability of new linear/nonlinear equalizer has been shown to be bet- 
ter than a linear equalizer in an experimental channel. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
In a typical communication system, a sequence of symbols {Ii} are transmitted though a 
linear time-dispersive channel h(t). Let x(t) be the received signal, it can be written as 
x(t) = Elih(t-nT) +w(t) 
i (1) 
where h(t) denotes the elementary pulse waveform, and w(t) represents the random noise 
with iid Gaussian distribution. In a Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM), symbols 
{Ii} are represented by complex numbers. During the transmission, interferences from 
neighboring symbols may distort the received signals. It is called Intersymbol Interference 
(ISI). It mainly because following reasons: nonideal channel which introduces phase or 
amplitude distortions, phase jitter, and impulse noise. Thus, equalization techniques are 
used to reduce the ISI.

2 ADAPTIVE LINEAR/RADIAL BASIS FUNCTION APPROACH 
TO EQUALIZER DESIGN 
Traditionally, the channel equalization problem is considered as a channel-inversion oper- 
ation. The idea is that an equalizer is constructed as to undo the interference from neigh- 
boring symbols as they passing through a linear dispersive channel. It can be used to 
explain different equalizer structures (Zero-forcing, Least mean square, and decision feed- 
back) and their performance [Proakis, 1989]. One problem of this approach is that in gen- 
eral there is no direct correspondence between error probability and residual error 
produced by the channel inversion operation. In [Gibson, et. al, 1991], authors proposed a 
classification viewpoint for the equalizer design. They suggested that the optimal equal- 
izer should be a classifier whose decision boundary is constructed according to Bayes 
decision rule. Compared with the channel inversion approach, the outputs of receiver are 
used as features for a classifier. The decision is made solely based on the classifier output, 
hence, on feature distribution. As it is well-known in [Fukunaga, 1978], the optimal deci- 
sion boundaries can rapidly be computed if the features are Gaussian distributed. How- 
ever, there is no idea about the structure of the optimal equalizer (classifier)for time- 
dispersive channel outputs. In next section, we prove that for a linear channel, the optimal 
equalizer is nonlinear. 
2.1 THE OPTIMAL EQUALIZER OF A LINEAR TIME-DISPERSIVE CHANNEL 
Let us first consider a two-value equalization problem. Symbols with two possible values 
{-1, 1} are transmitted. Let the channel be represented in a discrete form as a FIR of {hi}, 
i=0,N-1. The output x i can be written as 
N-1 
xi -- ,_jnj+ w, (2) 
j=0 
The optimal equalizer design is equivalent to the following Bayes decision problem. 
Given {xi}, decide I i by 
1 if P(li= llxi,xi+l,. .... ,Xi+N_i) _>P(li=-llxi,xi+l, ..... ,Xi+N_l) 
q: { (3) 
-1 if P(5=-llxi,xi+ ...... ,xi+v_ 1) >P(/= 11xii+ 1, ..... ,xi+V_l) 
where P (I i = 11 xi,x i + 1, ..... ,xi +v- 1.) is the posterior probability of the transmitted symbol 
I i being 1 given channel output {xiJ. 
By Bayes theorem, expression(3) can be expanded to the following form: 
P(li = 11 xi' .... xi+ l'Xi+N - 1) 
P (li = lxi,xi+ 1, ..... ,Xi+N- 1) 
: (4) 
P (xii+ 1, ..... ,Xi+N- 1) 
i+N-1 
. j=i 
I'I  P(xlri= lJi-N+l =ki-N+l)P(li = l''Ji-N+l=ki-N+l ) 
k,k 2 ...... ki_+  {1,-1} 
P (Xi'Xi+ 1' ..... 'Xi+N- 1) 
(5) 
Since conditional probability P (x,I I i = 1,... ,I i N+ 1 = ki-N+ 1) in (5) is a Gaussian distri- 
bution, the numerator in (5) is a mixture of Gaussian distribution. Plugging (5) into (3), 
Bayes decision rule determines the optimal decision boundary as the solution of equality. 
Since denominator is the same on both sides, it can be ignored. Rearranging the equation,

it can be written as summation of exponential functions. The solution of this equation is 
nonlinear function of {xi}. In general, no analytical form can be found. However, it can be 
solved by numerical methods. Thus, the optimal decision boundary can be determined. 
The result can be extended to multi-class problems. 
Based on the result established above, we provide a theoretical justification of a nonlinear 
equalizer approach to linear time-dispersive channel. The theoretical comparison of per- 
formances of linear and optimal equalizers can be found in [Gibson, et.al, 1991]. They 
concluded that performance of linear equalizers can not be improved by increasing tap 
length. This also suggests that a nonlinear equalizer approach is necessary. Another reason 
for nonlinear equalization approach is due to channels with spectrum hulls [Proakis, 
1989]. In this case, the linear equalizer can not achieve the desired performance due to 
noise enhancement. 
2.2 NONLINEAR EQUALIZER DESIGN PROBLEM 
There are several approaches to nonlinear equalizer design. To reduce the Least Mean 
Square (LMS) error, Voterra-series approach uses high-order product terms of input as 
new features. The tree-structured linear equalizer method [Gelfand, et.al., 1991] partitions 
the feature-space, and makes a piecewise linear approximation to the optimal nonlinear 
equalizer. As reported in [Gelfand, et.al., 1991], the tree-structured linear equalizer 
approach provides reasonable fast convergence and lower error probability as compared 
with linear and Voterra series approaches. The problem of this approach is that a lot of 
training samples are needed to achieve good performance. A neural network approach, 
MultiLayer Perceptron(MLP) [Gibson, et.al, 1991], trains 3 or 4 layers interconnected 
Percepttons to form the nonlinear decision boundary. It is observed in [Gibson, et. al, 
1991] that the performance of a MLP equalizer is close to optimal Bayes classifier. How- 
ever, the training time is long and a fine-turing procedure is used. A nonlinear equalizer 
approach using radial basis functions is also reported in [Chen, et.al., 1991]. 
To put equalizers into use, the long training time is unpractical, and a fine-adjusting proce- 
dure is not allowed. Hence, it is desired to have an efficient, automatic procedure for non- 
linear equalize design. To achieve this goal, we propose a hybrid linear and radial basis 
functions approach for automatic nonlinear equalizer design. 
Although the optimal equalizer should be nonlinear, all these nonlinear design methods 
require long training time or large amount of training samples. Linear equalizers are not 
optimal, but with following advantages: easy training, fast convergence. It is also reported 
that the linear equalizer is relatively robust [Fukunaga, 1978]. Hence, it is desirable to 
combine the advantages of both linear and nonlinear equalizers. However, the hybrid 
structure should provide desired properties: fast convergence, automatic training proce- 
dure, and low error rate. To satisfy these constraints, we propose a feature-space partition- 
ing approach to hybrid equalizer design. 
2.3 FEATURE-SPACE PARTITIONING APPROACH TO HYBRID EQUALIZER 
DESIGN 
To design a hybrid linear/nonlinear equalizer, we adopt the feature-space partitioning con- 
cept. The idea is similar to the one developed in [Gelfand, et.al, 1991]. Here, we consider 
a partitioning method based on geometrical reasoning for equalization problems. The idea 
is based on the fact that linear equalizers can recover distorted signals, except the cases 
when strong noise push samples into boundaries where two classes overlaid with each

other. We consider the confused samples as these samples near decision boundaries. The 
separation of confused samples can be accomplished based on the output values of lin- 
ear equalizers. If the distance between output value and the closest point in signal constel- 
lation [Proakis, 1989] is greater than a threshold, then we consider current sample is 
confused. This means that the sample is the one close to decision boundary. To achieve 
an accurate classification, we classify it by a nonlinear equalizer, which is constructed for 
separating the samples near Bayes decision boundary. 
The hybrid structure consisted of a linear equalizer, followed by a radial basis function 
(RBS) network, as shown in Fig. 1. A RBS network (Fig.2) is a two-layered network with 
radial_basis_function nodes in first layer, and a weighted linear combination of outputs of 
these nodes. 
Each feature vector consisted of a collection of consecutive data from the channel. It is 
assumed that these data are properly time and carder synchronized [Proakis, 1989]. For 
the QAM, a complex-valued linear equalizer is adopted. The distance between output 
value of linear equalizer and the closest point is then computed and compared with thresh- 
old as described before. The confused samples are classified by a nonlinear RBS equal- 
izer. The output of a RBS network can be written as weighted summation of outputs of 
nodes as follows:
