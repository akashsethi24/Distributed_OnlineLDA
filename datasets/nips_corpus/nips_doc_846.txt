Abstract 
Experiments were performed to reveal some of the computational 
properties of the human motor memory system. We show that 
as humans practice reaching movements while interacting with a 
novel mechanical environment, they learn an internal model of the 
inverse dynamics of that environment. Subjects show recall of this 
model at testing sessions 24 hours after the initial practice. The 
representation of the internal model in memory is such that there 
is interference when there is an attempt to learn a new inverse 
dynamics map immediately after an anticorrelated mapping was 
learned. We suggest that this interference is an indication that 
the same computational elements used to encode the first inverse 
dynamics map are being used to learn the second mapping. We 
predict that this leads to a forgetting of the initially learned skill. 
I Introduction 
In tasks where we use our hands to interact with a tool, our motor system develops 
a model of the dynamics of that tool and uses this model to control the coupled 
dynamics of our arm and the tool (Shadmehr and Mussa-Ivaldi 1994). In physical 
systems theory, the tool is a mechanical analogue of an admittance, mapping a force 
as input onto a change in state as output (Hogan 1985). In this framework, the

Figure 1: The experimental setup. The robot is 
a very low friction planar mechanism powered by 
two torque motors that act on the shoulder and 
elbow joints. Subject grips the end-point of the 
robot which houses a force transducer and moves 
the hand to a series of targets displayed on a moni- 
tor facing the subject (not shown). The function of 
the robot is to produce novel force fields that the 
subject learns to compensate for during reaching 
movements. 
model developed by the motor control system during the learning process needs to 
approximate an inverse of this mapping. This inverse dynamics map is called an 
internal model of the tool. 
We have been interested in understanding the representations that the nervous 
system uses in learning and storing such internal models. In a previous work we 
measured the way a learned internal model extrapolated beyond the training data 
(Shadmehr and Mussa-Ivaldi 1994). The results suggested that the coordinate sys- 
tem of the learned map was in intrinsic (e.g., joint or muscles based) rather than in 
extrinsic (e.g., hand based) coordinates. Here we present a mathematical technique 
to estimate the input-output properties of the learned map. We then explore the 
issue of how the motor memory might store two maps which have similar inputs 
but different outputs. 
2 Quantifying the internal model 
In our paradigm, subjects learn to control an artificial tool: the tool is a robot 
manipulandum which has torque motors that can be programmed to produce a 
variety of dynamical environments (Fig. 1). The task for the subject is to grasp 
the end-effector and make point to point reaching movements to a series of targets. 
The environments are represented as force fields acting on the subject's hand, and a 
typical case is shown in Fig. 2A. A typical experiment begins with the robot motors 
turned off. In this null environment subjects move their hand to the targets in a 
smooth, straight line fashion. When the force field is introduced, the dynamics of the 
task change and the hand trajectory is significantly altered (Shadmehr and Mussa- 
Ivaldi 1994). With practice (typically hundreds of movements), hand trajectories 
return to their straight line path. We have suggested that practice leads to formation 
of an internal model which functions as an inverse dynamics mapping, i.e., from a 
desired trajectory (presumably in terms of hand position and velocity, Wolpert et 
al. 1995) to a prediction of forces that will be encountered along the trajectory. We 
designed a method to quantify these forces and estimate the output properties of 
the internal model. 
If we position a force transducer at the interaction point between the robot and the 
subject, we can write the dynamics of the four link system in Fig. I in terms of the

following coupled vector differential equations: 
r (p) + Or(p, ) = E(p, ) +  F (1) 
Is(q) q- Os(q, ) = C(q, , q*(t)) - JT F (2) 
where I and G are inertial and Corriolis/centripetal matrix functions, E is the 
torque field produced by the robot's motors, i.e., the environment, F is the force 
measured at the handle of the robot, C is the controller implemented by the motor 
system of the subject, q*(t) is the reference trajectory planned by the motor system 
of the subject, J is the Jacobian matrix describing the differential transformation 
of coordinates from endpoint to joints, q and p are joint positions of the subject 
and the robot, and the subscripts s and r denote subject or robot matrices. 
In the null environment, i.e., E = 0 in Eq. (1), a solution to this coupled system 
is q = q*(t) and the arm follows the reference trajectory (typically a straight hand 
path with a Gaussian tangential velocity profile). Let us name the controller which 
accomplishes this task C = Co in Eq. (2). When the robot motors are producing a 
force field E  0, it can be shown that the solution is q = q*(t) if and only if the 
new controller in Eq. (2) is C = C = C0+ jTj;-T. The internal model composed 
by the subject is C - C0, i.e., the change in the controller after some training 
period. We can estimate this quantity by measuring the change in the interaction 
force along a given trajectory 
F0 and Fx, then we have: 
Fo(q,o,,q*(t)) 
Fl(q,o,,q*(t)) 
before and after training. If we call these functions 
= - - (3) 
= j-r(C ï¿½ + jfj;-r_ I- G) (4) 
The functions F0 and Fx are impedances of the subject's arm as viewed from the 
interaction port. Therefore, by approximating the difference Fx - F0, we have an 
estimate of the change in the controller. The crucial assumption is that the reference 
trajectory q*(t) does not change during the training process. 
In order to measure F0, we had the subjects make movements in a series of en- 
vironments. The environments were unpredictable (no opportunity to learn) and 
their purpose was to perturb the controller about the reference trajectory so we 
could measure F0 at neighboring states. Next, the environment in Fig. 2A was 
presented and the subject given a practice period to adapt. After training, Fx was 
estimated in a similar fashion as F0. The difference between these two functions was 
calculated along all measured arm trajectories and the results were projected onto 
the hand velocity space. Due to computer limitations, only 9 trajectories for each 
target direction were used for this approximation. The resulting pattern of forces 
were interpolated via a sum of Gaussian radial basis functions, and are shown in 
Fig. 2B. This is the change in the impedance of the arm and estimates the input- 
output property of the internal model that was learned by this subject. We found 
that this subject, which provided some of best results in the test group, learned to 
change the effective impedance of his arm in a way that approximated the imposed 
force field. This would be a sufficient condition for the arm to compensate for the 
force field and allow the hand to follow the desired trajectory. An alternate strategy 
might have been to simply co-contract arm muscles: this would lead to an increased 
stiffness and an ability to resist arbitrary environmental forces. Figure 2B suggests 
that practice led to formation of an internal model specific to the dynamics of the 
imposed force field.

2.1 Formation of the internal model in long-term memory 
Here we wished to determine whether subjects retained the internal model in long- 
term motor memory. We tested 16 naive subjects. They were instructed to move 
the handle of the robot to a sequence of targets in the null environment. Each 
movement was to last 500-4-50 msec. They were given visual feedback on the 
timing of each movement. After 600 movements, subjects were able to consistently 
reach the targets in proper time. These trajectories constituted a baseline set. 
Subjects returned the next day and were re-familiarized with the timing of the 
task. At this point a force field was introduced and subjects attempted to per- 
form the exact task as before: get to the target in proper time. A sequence of 600 
targets was given. When first introduced, the forces perturbed the subject's trajec- 
tories, causing them to deviate from the straight line path. As noted in previous 
work (Shadmehr and Mussa-Ivaldi 1994), these deviations decreased with practice. 
Eventually, subject's trajectories in the presence of the force field came to resemble 
those of the baseline, when no forces were present. The convergence of the trajec- 
tories to those performed at baseline is shown for all 16 subjects in Fig. 3A. The 
timing performance of the subjects while moving in the field is shown in Fig. 3B.
