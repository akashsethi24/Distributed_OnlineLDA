Abstract 
We do not have a good understanding of how theoretical principles 
of learning are realized in neural systems. To address this problem 
we built a computational model of development in the owl's sound 
localization system. The structure of the model is drawn from 
known experimental data while the learning principles come from 
recent work in the field of brain style computation. The model 
accounts for numerous properties of the owl's sound localization 
system, makes specific and testable predictions for future experi- 
ments, and provides a theory of the developmental process. 
I INTRODUCTION 
The barn owl, Tyro Alba, has a remarkable ability to localize sounds in space. In 
complete darkness it catches mice with nearly flawless precision. The owl depends 
upon this skill for survival, for it is a nocturnal hunter who uses audition to guide

its search for prey (Payne, 1970; Knudsen, Blasdel and Konishi, 1979). Central to 
the owl's localization system are the precise auditory maps of space found in the 
owl's optic tectum and in the external nucleus of the inferior colliculus (ICx). 
The development of these sensory maps poses a difficult problem for the nervous 
system, for their accuracy depends upon changing relationships between the animal 
and its environment. The owl encodes information about the location of a sound 
source by the phase and amplitude differences with which the sound reaches the 
owl's two ears. Yet these differences change dramatically as the animal matures 
and its head grows. The genome cannot know in advance precisely how the 
animal's head will develop - many environmental factors affect this process - so it 
cannot encode the precise development of the auditory system. Rather, the genome 
must design the auditory system to adapt to its environment, letting it learn the 
precise interpretation of auditory cues appropriate for its head and ears. 
In order to understand the nature of this developmental process, we built a connec- 
tionist model of the owl's sound localization system, using both theoretical principles 
of learning and knowledge of owl neurophysiology and neuroanatomy. 
2 THE ESSENTIAL SYSTEM TO BE MODELED 
The owl calculates the horizontal component of a sound source location by mea- 
suring the interaural time difference (ITD) of a sound as it reaches the two ears 
(Knudsen and Konishi, 1979). It computes the vertical component of the signal by 
determining the interaural level difference (ILD) of that same sound (Knudsen and 
Konishi, 1979). The animal processes these signals through numerous sub-cortical 
nuclei to form ordered auditory maps of space in both the ICx and the optic tectum. 
Figure i shows a diagram of this neural circuit. 
Neurons in both the ICx and the optic tectum are spatially tuned to auditory 
stimuli. Cells in these nuclei respond to sound signals originating from a restricted 
region of space in relation to the owl (Knudsen, 1984). Neurons in the ICx respond 
exclusively to auditory signals. Cells in the optic tectum, on the other hand, encode 
both audito?y and visual sensory maps, and drive the motor system to orient to the 
location of an auditory or visual signal. 
Researchers study the owl's development by systematically altering the animal's 
sensory experience, usually in one of two ways. They may fit the animal with a 
sound attenuating earplug, altering its auditory experience, or they may fit the owl 
with displacing prisms, altering its visual experience. 
Disturbance of either auditory or visual cues, during a period when the owl is de- 
veloping to maturity, causes neural and behavioral changes that bring the auditory 
map of space back into alignment with the visual nmp, and/or tune the auditory sys- 
tem to be sensitive to the appropriate range of binaural sound signals. The earplug 
induced changes take place at the level of the VLVp, where ILD is first computed 
(Mogdans and Knudsen, 1992). The visually induced adjustment of the auditory 
maps of space seems to take place at the level of the ICx (Brainard and Knudsen, 
1993b). The ability of the owl to adjust to altered sensory signals diminishes over 
time, and is greatly restricted in adulthood (Knudsen and Knudsen, 1990).

3 THE NETWORK MODEL 
The model has two major components: a network architecture based on the neuro- 
biology of the owl's localization system, as shown in Figure 1, and a learning rule 
derived from computational learning theory. The elements of the model are stan- 
dard connectionist units whose output activations are sigmoidal functions of their 
weighted inputs. The learning rule we use to train the model is not standard. In 
the following section we describe how and why we derived this rule. 
3.1 DEFINING THE GOAL OF THE NETWORK 
The goal of the network, and presumably the owl, is to accurately map sound signals 
to sound source locations. The network must discover a model of the world which 
best captures the relationship between sound signals and sound source locations. 
Recent work in connectionist learning theory has shown us ways to design networks 
that search for the model that best fits the data at hand (Buntine and Weigend, 
1991; MacKay, 1992; Rumelhart, Durbin, Golden and Chauvin, in press). In this 
section we apply such an analysis to the localization network.

3.2 DERIVING THE FUNCTION TO BE MAXIMIZED 
The network should maximize the probability of the model given the data. Using 
Bayes' rule we write this probability as: 
p(Mil ) = 
P(V) 
Ilere M represents the model (the units, weights and associated biases) and D 
represents the data. We define the data as a set of ordered pairs, [< sound - 
signal, location-signal >i], which represent the cues and targets normally used to 
train a conncctionist network. In the owl's case the cues are the auditory signals, 
and the target information is provided by the visual system. (Table I lists the 
mathematical terms we use in this section.) 
We simplify this equation by taking the natural logarithm of each side giving: 
In P(MtV) - In P(VIM) + In P(M) - In 
Since the natural logarithm is a monotonic transformation, if the network maximizes 
the second equation it will also maximize the first. 
The final term in the equation, In P(D), represents the probability of the ordered 
pairs the network observes. Regardless of which model the network settles upon, 
this term remains the same - the data are a constant during training. Therefore we 
can ignore it when choosing a model. 
The second term in the equation, In P(.A4), represents the probability of the model. 
This is the prior term in Bayesian analysis and is our estimation of how likely it 
is that a particular model is true, regardless of the data. We will discuss it below. 
For now we will concentrate on maximizing In P(Dt./4 ).

3.3 ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE NETWORK'S ENVIRONMENT 
We assume that the training data - pairs of stylized auditory and visual signals - 
are independent of one another and re-write the previous term as: 
lnP(Z)tA4 ) = y]lnP(< 7, ff>i 
i 
The i subscript denotes the particular data, or training, pair. We further expand 
this term to: 
In P(DI.A4 ) =  In P(.l�i A .,M) + E In P(:r'i). 
i i 
We ignore the last term, since the sound signals are not dependent on the model. 
Ve are left, then, with the task of maximizing ]iln P(li A .A4). It is important 
to note that ffi represents a visual signal, not a localization decision. The network 
attempts to predict its visual experience given its auditory experience. It does not 
predict the probability of making an accurate localization decision. If we assume 
that visual signals provide the target values for the network, then this analysis shows 
that the auditory map will always follow the visual map, regardless of whether this 
leads to accurate localization behavior or not. Our assumption is supported by 
experiments showing that, in the owl, vision does guide the formation of auditory 
spatial maps (Knudsen and Knudsen, 1985; Knudsen, 1988). 
Next, we must clarify the relationship between the inputs, 'i and the targets, . 
We know that the real world is probabilistic - that for a given input there exists 
some distribution of possible target values. We need to estimate the shape
