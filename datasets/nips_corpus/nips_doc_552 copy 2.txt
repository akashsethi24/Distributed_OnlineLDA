Abstract 
This work discusses various optimization techniques which were 
proposed in models for controlling arm movements. In particular, the 
minimum-muscle-tension-change model is investigated. A dynamic 
simulator of the monkey's arm, including seventeen single and double 
joint muscles, is utilized to generate horizontal hand movements. The 
hand trajectories produced by this algorithm are discussed. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
To perform a voluntary hand movement, the primate nervous system must solve the 
following problems: (A) Which trajectory (hand path and velocity) should be used while 
moving the hand from the initial to the desired position. () What muscle forces should 
be generated. Those two problems are termed ill-posed because they can be solved in 
an infinite number of ways. The interesting question to us is: what strategy does the 
nervous system use while choosing a specific solution for these problems ? The chosen 
solutions must comply with the known experimental data: Human and monkey's free 
horizontal multi-joint hand movements have straight or gently curved paths. The hand 
velocity profiles are always roughly bell shaped (Bizzi & Abend 1986).

1.1 THE MINIMUM-JERK MODEL 
Flash and Hogan (1985) proposed that a global kinematic optimization approach, the 
minimum-jerk model, defines a solution for the trajectory determination problem (problem 
A). Using this strategy, the nervous system is choosing the (unique) smoothest trajectory 
of the hand for any horizontal movement, without having to deal with the structure or 
dynamics of the arm. The minimum-jerk model produces reasonable approximations for 
hand trajectories in unconstrained point to point movements in the horizontal plane in 
front of the body (Flash & Hogan 1985; Morasso 1981; Uno et al. 1989a). It fails to 
describe, however, some important experimental findings for human arm movements (Uno 
et al. 1989a). 
1.2 THE EQUILIBRIUM-TRAJECTORY HYPOTHESIS 
According to the equilibrium-trajectory hypothesis (Feldman 1966), the nervous system 
generates movements by a gradual change in the equilibrium posture of the hand: at all 
times during the execution of a movement the muscle forces defines a stable posture 
which acts as a point of attraction in the configurational space of the limb. The actual 
hand movement is the realized trajectory. The realized hand trajectory is usually different 
from the attracting pre-planned virtual trajectory (Hogan 1984). Simulations by Flash 
(1987), have suggested that realistic multi-joint arm movements at moderate speed can be 
generated by moving the hand equilibrium position along a pre-planned minimum-jerk 
virtual trajectory. The interactions of the dynamic properties of the arm and the attracting 
virtual trajectory create together the actual realized trajectory. Flash did not suggest a 
solution to problem I. 
A static local optimization algorithm related to the equilibrium-trajectory hypothesis and 
called backdriving was proposed by Mussa-Ivaldi et al. (1991). This algorithm can be used 
to solve problem I only after the virtual trajectory is known. The virtual trajectory is not 
necessarily a minimum-jerk trajectory. Driving the arm from a current equilibrium position 
to the next one on the virtual trajectory is performed by two steps: 1) simulate a passive 
displacement of the arm to the new position and 2) update the muscle forces so as to 
eliminate the induced hand force. A unique active change (step 2) is chosen by finding 
these muscle forces which minimize the change in the potential energy stored in the 
muscles. Using a static model of the monkey's arm, the first author has analyzed this 
sequential computational approach, including a solution for both the trajectory 
determination (A) and the muscle forces (I) problems (Dornay 1990, 1991a, 1991b). 
The equilibrium-trajectory hypothesis which is using the minimum-jerk model was 
criticized by Katayama and Kawato (in preparation). According to their recent findings, 
the values of the dynamic stiffness used by Flash (1987) are too high to be realistic. They 
have found that a very complex virtual trajectory, completely different from the one 
predicted by the minimum-jerk model, is needed for coding realistic hand movements.

2 GLOBAL DYNAMIC OPTIMIZATIONS 
A set of global dynamic optimizations have been proposed by Uno et al. (1989a, 1989b). 
Uno et al. suggested that the dynamic properties of the arm must be considered by any 
algorithm for controlling hand movements. They also proposed that the hand trajectory 
and the motor commands (joint torques, muscle tensions, etc.,) are computed in parallel. 
2.1 THE MINIMUM-TORQUE-CHANGE MODEL 
Uno et al. (1989a) have proposed the minimum-torque-change model. The model proposes 
that the hand trajectory and the joint torques are determined simultaneously, while the 
algorithm minimizes globally the rate of change of the joint torques. The minimum-torque- 
change model was criticized by Flash (1990), saying that the rotary inertia used was not 
realistic. If Flash's inertia values are used then the hand path predicted by the minimum- 
torque-change model is curved (Flash 1990). 
2.2 THE MINIMUM-MUSCLE-TENSION-CHANGE MODEL 
The minimum-muscle-tension-change model (Uno et al. 1989b, Dornay et al. 1991) is a 
parallel dynamic optimization approach in which the trajectory determination problem (A) 
and the muscle force generation problem (II) are solved simultaneously. No explicit 
trajectory is imposed on the hand, but that it must reach the final desired state (position, 
velocity, etc.) in a pre-specified time. The numerical solution used is a penalty method, 
in which the controller minimizes globally by iterations an energy function E: 
e = o + (1) 
E is the energy that must be minimized in iterations. E o is a collection of hard 
constraints, like, for example that the hand must reach the desired position at the specified 
time. E s is a smoothness constraint, like the minimum-muscle-tension-change model.  
is a regularization function, that needs to become smaller and smaller as the number of 
iterations increases. This is a key point because the hard constraints must be strictly 
satisfied at the end of the iterative process. � is a small rate term. The smoothness 
constraint E s , is the minimum-muscle-tension-change model, defined as: 
Es = O.S f E ( df i / dt) 2 clt 
i--1 
t o 
(2) 
f. is the tension of muscle i, n is the total number of muscles, t o is the initial time and 
t� is the final time of the movement. 
Preliminary studies have shown (Uno et al. 1989b) that the minimum-muscle-tension- 
change model can simulate reasonable hand movements.

3 THE MONKEY'S ARM MODEL 
The model used was recently described (Domay 1991a; Domay et al. 1991). It is based 
on anatomical study using the Rhesus monkey. Attachments of 17 shoulder, elbow and 
double joint muscles were marked on the skeleton. The skeleton was cleaned and 
reassembled to a natural configuration of a monkey during horizontal arm movements 
(Fig. 1). X-ray analysis was used to create a simplified horizontal model of the arm (Fig. 
1). Effective origins and insertions of the muscles were estimated by computer 
simulations to ensure the postural stability of the hand at equilibrium (Dornay 199 la). The 
simplified dynamic model used in this study is described in Dornay et al. (1991).

4 THE BEHAVIORAL TASK 
We tried to simulate the horizontal arm movements reported by Uno et al. (1989a) for 
human subjects, using the monkey's model. Fig. 2 (left) shows a top view of the hand 
workspace of the monkey (light small dots). We used 7 hand positions defined by the 
following shoulder and elbow relative angles (in degrees): T 1 {14,122}; T 2 {67,100}; T 3 
{75,64}; T 4 {63,45}; T s {35,54}; T 6 {-5,101} and T 7 {-25,45}. The joint angles used by 
Uno et al. (1989a) for T 4 and T 7, {77,22} and {0,0}, are out of the workspace of the 
monkey's hand (open circles in Fig 2, left). We approximated them by our T 4 and T 7 
(filled circles). The behavioral task that we simulated using the minimum-muscle-tension- 
change model consisted of the 4 trajectories shown in Fig. 2 (right). 
5 SIMULATION RESULTS 
Figure 2 (right) shows the paths (T2->T6), (T3->T), (Tn->T1), and (T7->Ts). The paths T2- 
>T6, T3->T6 and T7->T 5 are slightly convex. Slightly convex paths for T=->T6 were 
reported in human movements by Flash (1987), Uno et al. (1989a) and Morasso (1981). 
Human T3->T6 paths have a small tendency to be slightly convex (Uno et al. 1989a; Flash 
(1987). In our simulations, T=->T6 and T3->T6 have slightly larger curvatures than those 
reported in humans. Human large movements from the side of the body to the front of the 
body similar to our T7->T 5 were reported by Uno et al. (1989a). The path of these 
movements is convex and similar to our simulation results. The simulated path of
