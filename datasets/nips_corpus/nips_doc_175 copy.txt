ABSTRACT 
We have previously developed a simple mathemati- 
cal model for formation of ocular dominance columns in 
msmmalinn visual cortex. The model provides a com- 
mon framework in which a variety of activity-dependent 
biological machnnisms can be studied. Analytic and com- 
putational results together now reveal the following: if 
inputs specific to each eye are locally correlated in their 
firing, and are not anticorrelated within an arbor radius, 
monocular cells will robustly form and be organized by 
intra-cortical interactions into column. Broader corre- 
lations within each eye, or anti-correlations between the 
eyes, create a more purely monocular cortex; positive cor- 
relation over an arbor radius yields an almost perfectly 
monocular cortex. Most features of the model can be un- 
derstood analytically through decomposition into eigen- 
functions and linear stability analysis. This allows predic- 
tion of the widths of the coh,mns and other features from 
measurable biological parameters. 
INTRODUCTION 
In the developing visual system in many mammalian species, there is initially a uni- 
form, overlapping innervation of layer 4 of the visual cortex by inputs representing 
the two eyes. Subsequently, these inputs segregate into patches or stripes that are 
largely or exclusively innervated by inputs serving a single eye, known as ocular 
dominance patches. The ocular dominance patches are on a small scale compared 
to the map of the visual world, so that the initially continuous map becomes two 
interdigitated maps, one representing each eye. These patches, together with the 
layers of cortex above and below layer 4, whose responses are dominated by the 
eye innervating the corresponding layer 4 patch, are known as ocular dominance 
columns.

The discoveries of this system of ocular dominance and many of the basic features 
of its development were made by Hubel and Wiesel in a series of pioneering studies 
in the 1960s and 1970s (e.g. Wiesel and Hubel (1965), Hubel, Wiesel and LeVay 
(1977)). A recent brief review is in Miller and Stryker (1989). 
The segregation of patches depends on local correlations of neural activity that are 
very much greater within neighboring cells in each eye than between the two eyes. 
Forcing the eyes to fire synchronously prevents segregation, while forcing them to 
fire more asynchronously than normally causes a more complete segregation than 
normal. The segregation also depends on the activity of cortical cells. Normally, ff 
one eye is closed in a young kitten during a critical period for developmental plas- 
ticity (monocular deprivationS), the more active, open eye comes to dominantly or 
exclusively drive most cortical cells, and the inputs and influence of the closed eye 
become largely confined to small islands of cortex. However, when cortical cells are 
inhibited from firing, the opposite is the case: the less active eye becomes dominant, 
suggesting that it is the correlation between pre- and post-synaptic activation that 
is critical to synaptic strengthening. 
We have developed and analyzed a simple mathematical model for formation of 
ocular dominance patches in mammalian visual cortex, which we briefly review 
here (Miller, Keller, and Stryker, 1986). The model provides a common framework 
in which a variety of activity-dependent biological models, including Hebb synapses 
and activity-dependent release and uptake of trophic factors, can be studied. The 
equations are similar to those developed by Linsker (1986) to study the development 
of orientation selectivity in visual cortex. We have now extended our analysis and 
also undertaken extensive simulations to achieve a more complete understanding of 
the model Many results have appeared, or will appear, in more detail elsewhere 
(Miller, Keller and Stryker, 1989; Miller and Stryker, 1989; Miller, 1989). 
EQUATIONS 
Consider inputs carrying information from two eyes and co-innervating a single cor- 
tical sheet. Let SL(z, 5, t) and SR(z, 5, t), respectively, be the left eye and right 
eye synaptic weight from eye-coordinate 5 to cortical coordinate x at time t. Con- 
sideration of simple activity-dependent models of synaptic plasticity, such as Hebb 
synapses or activity-dependent release and uptake of trophic or modification factors, 
leads to equations for the time development of S L and SR: 
a, = (1) 
y, fi,K 
J, K are variables which each may take on the values L, R. A(z-5) is a connectivity 
function, giving the number of synapses from 5 to x (we assume an identity mapping 
from eye coordinates to cortical coordinates). C 'K (5- f) measures the correlation 
in firing of inputs from eyes J and K when the inputs are separated by the distance 
 - f. I(x - y) is a model-dependent spread of influence across cortex, telling how 
two synapses which fire synchronously, separated by the distance z- y, will influence

one another's growth. This influence incorporates lateral synaptic interconnections 
in the case of Hebb synapses (for linear activation, I = (1 - B) -z, where 1 is 
the identity matrix and B is the matrix of cortico-cortical synaptic weights), and 
incorporates the effects of diffusion of trophic or modification factors in models 
involving such factors. ),  and e are constants. Constraints to conserve or limit 
the total synaptic strength supported by a single cell, and nonlinearities to keep left- 
and right-eye synaptic weights positive and less than some maximum, are added. 
Subtracting the equation for $R from that for $L yields a model equation for the 
difference, $D(z, 6, t) ---- $L(z, 6, t) -- $t(z, 6,):

SIMULATIONS 
The development of equation (1) was studied in simulations using three 25 x 25 
grids for the two input layers, one representing each eye, and a single cortical layer. 
Each input cell connects to a 7 x 7 square arbor of cortical cells centered on the 
corresponding grid point (A(x) = 1 on the square of +3 grid points, 0 otherwise). 
Initial synaptic weights are randomly assigned from a uniform distribution between 
0.8 and 1.2. Synapses are allowed to decrease to 0 or increase to a weight of 8. 
Synaptic strength over each cortical cell is conserved by subtracting after each 
iteration from each active synapse the average change in synaptic strength on that 
cortical cell. Periodic boundary conditions on the three grids are used. 
A typical time development of the cortical pattern of ocular dominance is shown 
in figure 1. For this simulation, correlations within each eye decrease with distance 
to zero over 4-5 grid points (circularly symmetric gaussian with parameter 2.8 
grid points). There are no opposite-eye correlations. The cortical interaction func- 
tion is a Mexican hat  function excitatory between nearest neighbors and weakly 
inhibitory more distantly ([(x) = exp((L) 2) - exp(I---12, )I 0.93.) Indi- 
vidual cortical cell receptive fields refine in size and become monocular (innervated 
exclusively by a single eye), while individual input arbors refine in size and become 
confined to alternating cortical stripes (not shown). 
Dependence of these results on the correlation function is shown in figure 2. Wider 
ranging correlations within each eye, or addition of opposite-eye anticorrelations, 
increase the monocularity of cortex. Same-eye anticorrelations decrease monocu- 
larity, and if significant within an arbor radius (i.e. within +3 grid points for the 
7 x 7 square arbors) tend to destory the monocular organization, as seen at the 
lower right. Other simulations (not shown) indicate that same-eye correlation over 
nearest neighbors is sufficient to give the periodic organization of ocular dominance, 
while correlation over an arbor radius gives an essentially fully monocular cortex.

model also reproduces the experimental effects of monocular deprivation, including 
the presence of a critical developmental period for this effect. 
EI(gENFUNCTION ANALYSIS 
Consider an initial condition for which S �  0, and near which equation (2) 
linearises some more complex, nonlinear biological reality. S z --- 0 is a time- 
independent solution of equation (2). Is this solution stable to small perturbations, 
so that equality of the two eyes will be restored after perturbation, or is it unstable, 
so that a pattern of ocular dominance will grow? If it is unstable, which pattern 
will initially grow the fastest? These are inherently linear questions: they depend 
only on the behavior of the equations when S � is small, so that nonlinear terms 
are negligible. 
To solve this problem, we find the characteristic, independently growing modes of 
equation (2). These are the eigenfunctions of the operator on the right side of that 
equation. Each mode grows exponentially with growth rate given by its eigenvalue. 
If any eigenvalue is positive (they are real), the corresponding mode will grow
