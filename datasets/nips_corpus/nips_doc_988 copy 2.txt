Abstract 
We have recently developed a theory of spatial representations in 
which the position of an object is not encoded in a particular frame 
of reference but, instead, involves neurons computing basis func- 
tions of their sensory inputs. This type of representation is able 
to perform nonlinear sensorimotor transformations and is consis- 
tent with the response properties of parietal neurons. We now ask 
whether the same theory could account for the behavior of human 
patients with parietal lesions. These lesions induce a deficit known 
as hemineglect that is characterized by a lack of reaction to stimuli 
located in the hemispace contralateral to the lesion. A simulated 
lesion in a basis function representation was found to replicate three 
of the most important aspects of hemineglect: i) The models failed 
to cross the leftmost lines in line cancellation experiments, ii) the 
deficit affected multiple frames of reference and, iii) it could be 
object centered. These results strongly support the basis function 
hypothesis for spatial representations and provide a computational 
theory of hemineglect at the single cell level. 
I Introduction 
According to current theories of spatial representations, the positions of objects 
are represented in multiple modules throughout the brain, each module being spe- 
cialized for a particular sensorimotor transformation and using its own frame of 
reference. For instance, the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) appears to encode the 
location of objects in oculocentric coordinates, presumably for the control of sac- 
cadic eye movements. The ventral intraparietal cortex (VIP) and the premotor 
cortex, on the other hand, seem to use head-centered coordinates and might be

This modular theory of spatial representations is not fully consistent with the be- 
havior of patients with parietal or frontal lesions. Such lesions causes a syndrome 
known as hemineglect which is characterized by a lack of response to sensory stim- 
uli appearing in the hemispace contralateral to the lesion [3]. According to the 
modular view, the deficit should be behavior dependent, e.g., oculocentric for eye 
movements, head-centered for reaching. However, experimental and clinical studies 
show that this is not the case. Instead, neglect affects multiple frames of reference 
simultaneously, and to a first approximation, independently of the task. 
This point is particularly clear in an experiment by Karnath et al (1993) (Fig- 
ure 1A). Subjects were asked to identify a stimulus that can appear on either side 
of the fixation point. In order to test whether the position of the stimuli with 
respect to the body affects performance, two conditions were tested: a control con- 
dition with head straight ahead (C1), and a second condition with head rotated 
20 degrees on the right (or equivalently, with the trunk rotated 20 degrees on the 
left, see figure) (C2). In C2, both stimuli appeared further to the right of the trunk 
while being at the same location with respect to the head and retina than in C1. 
Moreover, the trunk-centered position of the left stimulus in C2 was the same than 
the trunk-centered position of the right stimulus in C1. 
As expected, subjects with right parietal lesions performed better on the right 
stimulus in the control condition, a result consistent with both, retinotopic and 
trunk-centered neglect. To distinguish between the two frames of reference, one 
needs to compare performance across conditions. 
If the deficit is purely retinocentric, the results should be identical in both condi- 
tions, since the retinotopic location of the stimuli does not vary. If, on the other 
hand, the deficit is purely trunk-centered, the performance on the left stimulus 
should improve when the head is turned right since the stimulus now appears fur- 
ther toward the right of the trunk-centered hemispace. Furthermore, performance 
on the right stimulus in the control condition should be the same as performance on 
the left stimulus in the rotated condition, since they share the same trunk-centered 
position in both cases.

Neither of these hypotheses can fully account for the data. As expected from a 
retinotopic neglect, subjects always performed better on the right stimulus in both 
conditions. However, performance on the left stimulus improved when the head 
was turned right (C2), though not sufficiently to match the level of performance on 
the right stimulus in the control condition (C1). Therefore, these results suggest a 
retinotopic neglect modulated by trunk-centered factors. 
In addition, Karnath et al (1991) tested patients on a similar experiment in which 
subjects were asked to generate a saccade toward the target. The analysis of reaction 
time revealed the same type of results than the one found in the identification 
task, thereby demonstrating that the spatial deficit is, to a first approximation, 
independent of the task. 
An experiment by Arguin and Bub (1993) suggests that neglect can be object- 
centered as well. As shown in figure lB, they found that reaction times were faster 
when the target appeared on the right of a set of distractors (C2), as opposed 
to the left (C1), even though the target is at the same retinotopic location in 
both conditions. Interestingly, moving the target further to the right leads to even 
faster reaction times (C3), showing that hemineglect is not only object-centered but 
retinotopic as well in this task. 
These results strongly support the existence of spatial representations using multiple 
frames of reference simultaneously shared by several behaviors. We have recently 
developed a theory [6] which has precisely these properties and we ask here whether 
a simulated lesion would lead to a deficit similar to hemineglect. Our theory posits 
that parietal neurons computes basis function (BF) of sensory signals, such as vi- 
sual, or auditory inputs, and posture signals, such as eye or head position. The 
resulting representation, which we called a basis function map, can be used for per- 
forming nonlinear transformations of the sensory inputs, the type of transformations 
required for sensorimotor coordination. 
2 Model Organization 
The model contains two distinct parts: a network for performing sensorimotor trans- 
formations and a selection mechanism. 
2.1 Network Architecture 
We implemented a network using basis function units in the intermediate layer 
to perform a transformation from a visual retinotopic map to two motor maps 
in, respectively, head-centered and oculocentric coordinates (Figure 2). The input 
contains a retinotopic visual map analog to the one found in the early stages of 
visual processing, and a set of units encoding eye position, similar to the neurons 
found in the intralaminar nucleus of the thalamus. These input units project to a 
set of intermediate units shared by both transformations. Each intermediate unit 
computes a gaussian of the retinal location of object, rz, multiplied by a sigmoid of 
eye position, ez:

These units are organized in a map covering all possible combinations of retinal 
and eye position selectivities. As we have shown elsewhere [6], this type of response 
function is consistent with the response of single parietal neurons found in area 7a.

The resulting map forms a basis function map which encodes the location of objects 
in head-centered and retinotopic coordinates simultaneously. 
The activity of the unit in the output maps is computed by a simple linear combi- 
nation of the BF unit activities. Appropriate values of the weights were found by 
using linear regression techniques� 
This architecture mimics the pattern of projections of the parietal area 7a. 7a is 
known to project to, both, the superior colliculus and the premotor cortex (via the 
ventral parietal area, VIP), in which neurons have, respectively, retinotopic and 
head-centered visual receptive fields. Figure 2B shows a typical pattern of activity 
in the network when two stimuli are presented simultaneously while the eye fixated 
10 degrees toward the right. 
2.2 Hemispheric Biases and Lesion Model 
Neurophysiological data indicate that both hemispheres contain neurons with all 
possible combinations of retinal and eye position selectivities, but with a contralat- 
eral bias. Hence, most neurons in the right parietal cortex (resp. left) have their 
retinal receptive field on the left hemiretina (resp. right). The bias for eye position 
is much weaker but a trend has been reported in several studies [1]. 
Therefore, spatial repre
