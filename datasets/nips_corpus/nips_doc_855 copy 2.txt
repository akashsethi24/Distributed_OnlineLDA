Abstract 
This paper presents results from the first use of neural networks 
for the real-time feedback control of high temperature plasmas in 
a tokamak fusion experiment. The tokamak is currently the prin- 
cipal experimental device for research into the magnetic confine- 
ment approach to controlled fusion. In the tokamak, hydrogen 
plasmas, at temperatures of up to 100 Million K, are confined 
by strong magnetic fields. Accurate control of the position and 
shape of the plasma boundary requires real-time feedback control 
of the magnetic field structure on a time-scale of a few tens of mi- 
croseconds. Software simulations have demonstrated that a neural 
network approach can give significantly better performance than 
the linear technique currently used on most tokamak experiments. 
The practical application of the neural network approach requires 
high-speed hardware, for which a fully parallel implementation of 
the multilayer perceptron, using a hybrid of digital and analogue 
technology, has been developed.

1 INTRODUCTION 
Fusion of the nuclei of hydrogen provides the energy source which powers the sun. 
It also offers the possibility of a practically limitless terrestrial source of energy. 
However, the harnessing of this power has proved to be a highly challenging prob- 
lem. One of the most promising approaches is based on magnetic confinement of a 
high temperature (10 7 - 10 s Kelvin) plasma in a device called a tokamak (from the 
Russian for 'toroidal magnetic chamber') as illustrated schematically in Figure 1. 
At these temperatures the highly ionized plasma is an excellent electrical conduc- 
tor, and can be confined and shaped by strong magnetic fields. Early tokamaks 
had plasmas with circular cross-sections, for which feedback control of the plasma 
position and shape is relatively straightforward. However, recent tokamaks, such as 
the COMPASS experiment at Culham Laboratory, as well as most next-generation 
tokamaks, are designed to produce plasmas whose cross-sections are strongly non- 
circular. Figure 2 illustrates some of the plasma shapes which COMPASS is de- 
signed to explore. These novel cross-sections provide substantially improved energy 
confinement properties and thereby significantly enhance the performance of the 
tokamak.

Figure 1: Schematic cross-section of a tokamak experiment show- 
ing the toroidal vacuum vessel (outer D-shaped curve) and plasma 
(shown shaded). Also shown are the radial (R) and vertical (Z) co- 
ordinates. To a good approximation, the tokamak can be regarded 
as axisymmetric about the Z-axis, and so the plasma boundary can 
be described by its cross-sectional shape at one particular toroidal 
location. 
Unlike circular cross-section plasmas, highly non-circular shapes are more difficult to 
produce and to control accurately, since currents through several control coils must 
be adjusted simultaneously. Furthermore, during a typical plasma pulse, the shape 
must evolve, usually from some initial near-circular shape. Due to uncertainties 
in the current and pressure distributions within the plasma, the desired accuracy 
for plasma control can only be achieved by making real-time measurements of the 
position and shape of the boundary, and using error feedback to adjust the currents 
in the control coils. 
The physics of the plasma equilibrium is determined by force balance between the

thermal pressure of the plasma and the pressure of the magnetic field, and is rel- 
atively well understood. Particular plasma configurations are described in terms 
of solutions of a non-linear partial differential equation called the Grad-Shafranov 
(GS) equation. Due to the non-linear nature of this equation, a general analytic 
solution is not possible. However, the GS equation can be solved by iterative nu- 
merical methods, with boundary conditions determined by currents flowing in the 
external control coils which surround the vacuum vessel. On the tokamak itself it 
is changes in these currents which are used to alter the position and cross-sectional 
shape of the plasma. Numerical solution of the GS equation represents the stan- 
dard technique for post-shot analysis of the plasma, and is also the method used 
to generate the training dataset for the neural network, as described in the next 
section. However, this approach is computationally very intensive and is therefore 
unsuitable for feedback control purposes. 
For real-time control it is necessary to have a fast (typically _ 50/sec.) determi- 
nation of the plasma boundary shape. This information can be extracted from a 
variety of diagnostic systems, the most important being local magnetic measure- 
ments taken at a number of points around the perimeter of the vacuum vessel. 
Most tokamaks have several tens or hundreds of small pick up coils located at care- 
fully optimized points around the torus for this purpose. We shall represent these 
magnetic signals collectively as a vector m. 
For a large class of equilibria, the plasma boundary can be reasonably well repre- 
sented in terms of a simple parameterization, governed by an angle-like variable 0, 
given by 
R(O) = Ro+acos(O+6sinO) 
Z(O) = Zo + a: sin 0 
where we have defined the following parameters

Z0 vertical distance of the plasma center from the torus midplane, 
a minor radius measured in the plane Z - Z0,

We denote these parameters collectively by y. The basic problem which has to be 
addressed, therefore, is to find a representation for the (non-linear) mapping from 
the magnetic signals m to the values of the geometrical parameters yk, which can 
be implemented in suitable hardware for real-time control. 
The conventional approach presently in use on many tokamaks involves approxi- 
mating the mapping between the measured magnetic signals and the geometrical 
parameters by a single linear transformation. However, the intrinsic non-linearity 
of the mappings suggests that a representation in terms of feedforward neural net- 
works should give significantly improved results (Lister and Schnurrenberger, 1991; 
Bishop et al., 1992; Lagin et al., 1993). Figure 3 shows a block diagram of the 
control loop for the neural network approach to tokamak equilibrium control.

2 SOFTWARE SIMULATION RESULTS 
The dataset for training and testing the network was generated by numerical so- 
lution of the GS equation using a free-boundary equilibrium code. The data base 
currently consists of over 2,000 equilibria spanning the wide range of plasma po- 
sitions and shapes available in COMPASS. Each equilibrium configuration takes 
several minutes to generate on a fast workstation. The boundary of each configu- 
ration is then fitted using the form in equation 1, so that the equilibria are labelled 
with the appropriate values of the shape parameters. Of the 120 magnetic signals 
available on COMPASS which could be used to provide inputs to the network, a

subset of 16 has been chosen using sequential forward selection based on a linear 
representation for the mapping (discussed below). 
It is important to note that the transformation from magnetic signals to flux surface 
parameters involves an exact linear invariance. This follows from the fact that, if all 
of the currents are scaled by a constant factor, then the magnetic fields will be scaled 
by this factor, and the geometry of the plasma boundary will be unchanged. It is 
important to take advantage of this prior knowledge and to build it into the network 
structure, rather than force the network to learn it by example. We therefore 
normalize the vector m of input signals to the network by dividing by a quantity 
proportional to the total plasma current. Note that this normalization has to be 
incorporated into the hardware implementation of the network, as will be discussed 
in Section 3.
