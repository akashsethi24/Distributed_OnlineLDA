Abstract 
Optimal Brain Damage (OBD) is a method for reducing the num- 
ber of weights in a neural network. OBD estimates the increase in 
cost function if weights are pruned and is a valid approximation 
if the learning algorithm has converged into a local minimum. On 
the other hand it is often desirable to terminate the learning pro- 
cess before a local minimum is reached (early stopping). In this 
paper we show that OBD estimates the increase in cost function 
incorrectly if the network is not in a local minimum. We also show 
how OBD can be extended such that it can be used in connec- 
tion with early stopping. We call this new approach Early Brain 
Damage, EBD. EBD also allows to revive already pruned weights. 
We demonstrate the improvements achieved by EBD using three 
publicly available data sets. 
I Introduction 
Optimal Brain Damage (OBD) was introduced by Le Cun et al. (1990) as a method 
to significantly reduce the number of weights in a neural network. By reducing the 
number of free parameters, the variance in the prediction of the network is often 
reduced considerably which --in some cases-- leads to an improvement in general- 
ization performance of the neural network. OBD might be considered a realization 
of the principle of Occam's razor which states that the simplest explanation (of the 
training data) should be preferred to more complex explanations (requiring more 
weights). 
If E is the cost function which is minimized during training, OBD calculates the

saliency of each parameter wi defined as 
102E 2 
OBD(wi) = A(wi) = 20w wi' 
Weights with a small OBD(wi) are candidates for removal. OBD(wi) has the 
intuitive meaning of being the increase in cost function if weight wi is set to zero 
under the assumptions 
� that the cost function is quadratic, 
� that the cost function is diagonal which means it can be written as E - 
Bias + 1/2-.ihi(w i -- w?) 2 where where I- ,w 
t'wi ;i= are the weights in a 
(local) optimum of the cost function (Figure 1) and the hi and BIAS are 
parameters which are dependent on the training data set. 
� and that wi  w. 
In practice, all three assumptions are often violated but experiments have demon- 
strated that OBD is a useful method for weight removal. 
In this paper we want to take a closer look at the third assumption, i.e. the assump- 
tion that weights are close to optimum. The motivation is that theory and practice 
have shown that it is often advantageous to perform early stopping which means 
that training is terminated before convergence. Early stopping can be thought of 
as a form of regularization: since training typically starts with small weights, with 
early stopping weights are biased towards small weights analogously to other reg- 
ularization methods such as ridge regression and weight decay. According to the 
assumptions in OBD we might be able to apply OBD only in heavily overtrained 
networks where we loose the benefits of early stopping. In this paper we show that 
OBD can be extended such that it can work together with early stopping. We call 
the new criterion Early Brain Damage (EBD). As in OBD, EBD contains a num- 
ber of simplifying assumptions which are typically invalid in practice. Therefore, 
experimental results have to demonstrate that EBD has benefits. We validate EBD 
using three publicly available data sets. 
2 Theory 
As in OBD we approximate the cost function locally by a quadratic function and 
assume a diagonal form. Figure 1 illustrates that OBD(wi) for wi = w? calculates 
the increase in cost function if wi is set to zero. In early stopping where wi  w, 
OBD(wi) calculates the quantity denoted as Ai in Figure 1. Consider 
OE 
Si  -w i. 
The saliency of weights wi in Early Stopping Pruning 
ESP(wi) -- Ai q- Bi 
is an estimate of how much the cost function increases if the current wi (i.e. wi in 
early stopping) is set to zero. Finally, consider

Figure 1: The figure shows the cost function E as a function of one weight wi 
in the network. w? is the optimal weight. wi is the weight at an early stopping 
point. If OBD is applied at wi, it estimates the quantity Ai. ESP(wi): Ai q- 
Bi = E(wi) - E(wi = 0) estimate the increase in cost function if wi is pruned. 
EBD(wi) -- Ai + Bi + Ci = E(w?) - E(wi = 0) is the difference in cost function 
if we would train to convergence and if we would set wi = 0. In other words

The saliency of weight wi in EBD is 
EBO(wi) = OBO(w) = Ai + 
which estimates the increase in cost function if wi is pruned after convergence (i.e. 
EBD(wi) = OBD(w?)) but based on local information around the current value 
of wi. In this sense EBD evaluates the potential of wi. Weights with a small 
EBD(wi) are candidates for pruning. 
Note, that all terms required for EBD are easily calculated. With a quadratic cost 
function E = -]k=(. -NN(xk)) 20BD approximates (OBD-approximation)

3.1 Revival of Weights 
In some cases, it is beneficial to revive weights which are already pruned. Note, that 
Ci exactly estimate the decrease in cost function if weight wi is revived. Weights 
with a large Ci(wi = 0) are candidates for revival. 
3.2 Early Brain Surgeon (EBS) 
After OBD or EBD is performed, the network needs to be retrained since the 
diagonal approximation is typically violated and there are dependencies between 
weights. Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS, Hassibi and Storck, 1993) does not use 
the diagonal approximation and recalculates the new weights without explicit 
retraining. OBS still assumes a quadratic approximation of the cost function. The 
saliency in OBS is 
2[Z-1]ii 
where [H-]ii is i-th diagonal element of the inverse of the Hessian. Li estimates the 
increase in cost if the i-th weight is set to zero and all other weights are retrained. 
To recalculate all weights after weight wi is removed apply 
wi H- ei 
Whew -- Wold [H- 1]i i 
where ei is the unit vector in the i-th direction. 
Analogously to OBS, Early Brain Surgeon EBS would first calculate the optimal 
weight vector using a second order approximation of the cost function 
b* = w - H-  OE 
Ow 
and then apply OBS using b*. We did not pursue this idea any further since our 
initial experiments indicated that w* was not estimated very accurately in praxis. 
Hassibi et al. (1994) achieved good performance with OBS even when weights were 
far from optimal.

3.3 Approximations to the Hessian ad the Gradient 
Finnoff et aI. (1993) have introduced the interesting idea that the relevant quantities 
for OBD can be estimated from the statistics of the weight changes. 
Consider the update in pattern by pattern gradient descent learning and a quadratic 
cost function

with E = (y - NN(xk)) 2 where r/is the learning rate. 
We assume that x  and y are drawn online from a fixed distribution (which is 
strictly not true since in pattern by pattern learning we draw samples from a fixed 
training data set). Then, using the quadratic and diagonal approximation of the 
cost function and assuming that the noise e in the model 
y = NN(x ) + e  
is additive uncorrelated with variance

we obtain 
VAR(Awi) = 2 _  
 + 2, 2. 
The first term in Equation 3 is a result of the residual error which is translated 
into weight fluctuations. But note, that weights with a small variance with a large 
c92E/cgw fluctuate the most. The first term is only active when there is a residual 
error, i.e. r 2 > 0. The second term is non-zero independent of r a and is due to the 
fact that in sample-by-sample learning, weight updates have a random component. 
From Equation 2 and Equation 3 all terms needed in EBD (i.e. OE/Ow, and 
c92E/Ow) are easily estimated. 
4 Experimental Results 
In our experiments we studied the performance of OBD, ESP and EBD in connec- 
tion with early stopping. Although theory tells us that EBD should provide the best 
estimate of the the increase in cost function by the removal of weight wi, it is not 
obvious how reliable that estimate is when the assumptions (diagonal quadratic 
cost function) are violated. Also we are not really interested in the correct estimate 
of the increase in cost function but in a ranking of the weights. Since the assump- 
tions which go into OBD, EBD, ESP (and also OBS and EBS) are questionable, the 
usefulness of the new methods have to be demonstrated using practical experiments. 
We used three different data sets: Breast Cancer Data, Diabetes Data, and Boston 
Housing Data. All three data sets can be obtained from the UCI repository 
(ftp:ics.uci.edu/pub/machine-learning-databases). The Breast Cancer Data con-
