Abstract 
Vestibular compensation is the process whereby normal functioning is 
rgained following destruction of one member of the pair of peripheral 
vestibular receptors. Compensation was simulated by lesioning , dynamic 
neural network model of the vestibulo-ocular rflex O/OR) and retraining it 
using recurrent back-propagation. The model reproduced the paneam of VOR 
neuron activity experimentally observed in compensated animals, but only if 
connections hertofor considered uninvolved were allowed to be plastic. 
Because the model incorporated nonlinear units, it was able to reconcile 
previously conflicting, linear analyses of experimental results on the dynamic 
properties of VOR neurons in normal and coted animals. 
1 VESTIBULAR COMPENSATION 
Vestibular compensation is one of the oldest and most well studied paradigms in motor 
learning. Although it is neurophysiologically well described, the ,cltive mechanisms 
underlying vestibular compensation, and its effects on the dynamics of vestibular 
responses, are still poorly understood. The purpose of this study is to gain insight into 
the compensatory process by simulating it as learning in a recurrent neural network 
model of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR).

The VOR stabilizes gaze by producing eye rotations that counterbalance head 
rotations. It is mediated by brainstem neurons in the vestibular nuclei (VN) that relay 
head velocity signals from vestibular sensory afferent neurons to the motoneurons of 
the eye muscles (Wilson and Melvill Jones 1979). The VOR circuitry also processes 
the canal signals, stretching out their time constants by four times before transmitting 
this signal to the motoneurons. This process of time constant lengthening is known as 
velocity storage (Raphan et al. 1979). 
The VOR is a bilaterally symmetric structure that operates in push-pull. The VN are 
linked bilaterally by inhibitory commissural connections. Removal of the vestibular 
receptors from one side (hemilabyrinthectomy) unbalances the system, resulting in 
continuous eye movement that occurs in the absence of head movement, a condition 
known as spontaneous nystagmus. Such a lesion also reduces VOR sensitivity (gain) 
and eliminates velocity storage. Compensatory restoration of VOR occurs in stages 
(Fetter and Zee 1988). It begins by quickly eliminating spontaneous nystagmus, and 
continues by increasing VOR gain. Curiously, velocity storage never recovers. 
2 NETWORK ARCHITECTURE 
The horizontal VOR is modeled as a three-layered neural network (Figure 1). All of 
the units are nonlinear, passing their weighted input sums through the sigmoidal 
squashing function. This function bounds unit respons between zero and one. Input 
units represent afferents from the left (/hc) and right (rhc) horizontal semicircular 
canal receptors. Output units correspond to motoneurons of the lateral (lr) and roedial 
(mr) rectus muscles of the left eye. Interneurons in the VN are represented by hidden 
units on the left (lvnl, lvn2) and right (rvnl, rvn2) sides of the model brainstem. Bias 
units stand for non-vestibular inputs, on the left (lb) and right (rb) sides. 
Network connectivity reflects the known anatomy of mammalian VOR (Wilson and 
Melvill Jones 1979). Vestibular commissures are modeled as recurrent connections 
between hidden units on opposite sides. All connection weights to the hidden units are 
plastic, but those to the outputs are initially fixed, because it is generally believed that 
synaptic plasticity occurs only at the VN level in vestibular compensation (Galiana et 
al. 1984). Fixed hidden-to-output weights have a crossed, reciprocal pattern. 
3 TRAINING THE NORMAL NETWORK 
The simulations began by training the network shown in Figure 1, with both vestibular 
inputs intact (normal network), to produce the VOR with velocity storage (Anastasio 
1991). The network was trained using recurrent back-propagation (William.q and 
Zipset 1989). The input and desired output sequences correspond to the canal afferent 
signals and motoneuron eye-velocity commands that would produce the VOR response 
to two impulse head rotational accelerations, one to the left and the other to the right. 
One input (rhc) and desired output (lr) sequence is shown in Figure 2A (dotted and 
dsshed, respectivley). Those for/hc and mr (not shown) are identical but inverted. 
The desired output responses are equal in amplitude to the inputs, producing VOR

eye movements that would perfectly counterbalance head movements. The output 
respo decy more slowly than the input responses, reflecting velocity storage. 
Between head movements, both desired outputs have the same spontaneous firing rate 
of 0.50. With output spontaneous rates (SRs) balanced, no push-pull eye velocity 
command is given and, consequently, no VOR eye movement would be mde. 
The normal network learns the VOR transformation after about 4,000 training 
sequence presentations (passes). The network develops reciprocal connections from 
input to hidden units, as in the actual VOR (Wilson and Melvill Jones 1979). 
Inhibitory recurrent connections form an integrating (Ivnl, rvnl) and a non-integrating 
(lvn2, rvn2) pair of hidden units (Anastasio 1991). The rotegrating pair subserve 
storage in the network. They have strong mutual inhibition and exert net positive 
feedback on themeIves. The non-integrating pair have almost no mutual inhibition.

4 SIMULATING VESTIBULAR COMPENSATION 
After the normal network is constructed, with both inputs intact, vestibular 
compensation can be simulated by removing the input from one side and retraining 
with recurrent back-propagation. Left hemilabyrinthectomy produces deficits in the 
model that correspond to those observed experimentally. The responses of output unit 
lr acutely (i.e. immediately) following left input removal are shown in Figure 2A. 
The SR of lr (solid) is greatly increased above normal (dashed); that of mr (not shown) 
is decreased by the same amount. This output SR imbalance would re. suit in eye 
movement to the left in the absence of head movement (spontaneous nystagmus). The 
gain of the outputs is greatly decreased. This is due to removal of one half the 
network input, and to the SR imbalance forcing the output units into the low gain 
extremes of.the squashing function. Velocity storage is also eliminated by left input 
removal, due to events at the hidden unit level (see below). 
During retraining, the time course of simulated compensation is similar to that

observed experimentally (Fetter and Zee 1988). Spontaneous nystagmus is eliminated 
after 200 passes, as the SRs of the output units are brought back to their normal level 
(Figure 2B). Output unit gain is largely restored by 900 passes, but time constant 
remains close to that of the inputs (Figure 2C). At this stage, VOR gain would have 
increased substantially, but its time constant would remain low, indicating loss of 
velocity storage. This stage approximates the extent of experimeatally observed 
compensation (ibid.). Completely restoring the normal VOR, with full velocity 
storage, requires over seven times more retraining (Figure 2D). 
The responses of the hidden units during each stage of simulated compensation are 
shown in Figure 3A and 3C. Average hidden unit SR and gain are shown as dotted 
lines in Figure 3A and 3C, respectively. Acutely following left input removal (AC 
stage), the SRs of left (dashed) and right (solid) hidden units decrease and increase, 
respectively (Figure 3A). One left hidden unit (lvnl) is actually silenced. Hidden unit 
gain at AC stage is greatly reduced bilaterally (Figure 3C), as for the outputs. 
At the point where spontaneous nystagmus is eliminated (NE stage), hidden units SRs 
are balanced bilaterally, and none of the units are spontaneously silent (Figure 3A). 
When VOR gain is largely restored (GR stage, corresponding to experimentally 
observed compensation), the gains of the hidden units have substantially increased 
(Figure 3C). At GR stage, average hidden unit SR has also increased but the bilateral 
SR balance has been strictly maintained (Figure 3A). A comparison with experimental 
data (Yagi and Markham 1984; Newlands and Perachio 1990) reveals that the behavior 
of hidden units in the model does not correspond to that observed for real VN neurons 
in compensated animals. Rather than having bilateral SR balance, the average SR of 
VN neurons in compensated animals is lower on the lesion-side and higher on the 
intact-side. Moreover, many lesion-side VN neurons are permanently silenced. Also, 
rather than substantially recovering gain, the gains of VN neurons in compensated 
animals increase little from their low values acutely follo
