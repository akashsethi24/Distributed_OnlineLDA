ABSTRACT 
Transient phenomena associated with forward biased silicon p+ - n - n + struc- 
tures at 4.2K show remarkable similarities with biological neurons. The devices play 
a role similar to the two-terminal switching elements in Hodgkin-Huxley equivalent 
circuit diagrams. The devices provide simpler and more realistic neuron emulation 
than transistors or op-amps. They have such low power and current requirements 
that they could be used in massive neural networks. Some observed properties of 
simple circuits containing the devices include action potentials, refractory periods, 
threshold behavior, excitation, inhibition, summation over synaptic inputs, synaptic 
weights, temporal integration, memory, network connectivity modification based on 
experience, pacemaker activity, firing thresholds, coupling to sensors with graded sig- 
nal outputs and the dependence of firing rate on input current. Transfer functions 
for simple artificial neurons with spiketrain inputs and spiketrain outputs have been 
measured and correlated with input coupling. 
INTRODUCTION 
Here we discuss the simulation of neuron phenomena by electronic processes in 
silicon from the point of view of hardware for new approaches to electronic processing 
of information which parallel the means by which information is processed in intelli- 
gent organisms. Development of this hardware basis is pursued through exploratory 
work on circuits which exhibit some basic features of biological neural networks. Fig. 1 
shows the basic circuit used to obtain spiketrain outputs. A distinguishing feature 
of this hardware basis is the spontaneous generation of action potentials as a device 
physics feature.

TWO-TERMINAL SWITCHING ELEMENTS 
The use of transistor based circuitry 1 is avoided because transistor electrical 
characteristics are not similar to neuron characteristics. The use of devices with 
fundamentally non-neuronlike character increases the complexity of artificial neural 
networks. Complexity would be an important drawback for massive neural networks 
and most neural networks in nature achieve their remarkable performance through 
their massive size. In addition, transistors have three terminals whereas the switching 
elements of Hodgkin-Huxley equivalent circuits have two terminals. Motivated in 
part by Hodgkin-Huxley equivalent circuit diagrams, we employ two-terminal p+ - 
n - n + devices which execute transient switching between low conductance and high 
conductance states. (See Fig. 2) We call these devices injection mode devices (IMDs). 
In the OFF-STATE, a typical current through the devices is ~ 100fA/mm 2, and 
in the ON-STATE a typical current is ~ 10mA/mm 2. Hence this device is an 
extremely good switch with a ON/OFF ratio of 10 ll. As in real neurons , the current 
in the device is a function of voltage and time, not only voltage. The devices require 
cryogenic cooling but this results in an advantageously low quiescent power drain of 
< I nanowatt/cm  of chip area and the very low leakage currents mentioned above. 
In addition, the highly unique ability of the neural networks described here to operate 
in a cryogenic environment is an important advantage for infrared image processing 
at the focal plane (see Fig. 3 and further discussion below). Vision systems begin 
processing at the focal plane and there are many benefits to be gained from the 
vision system approach to IR image processing.

Coding of graded input signals (see Fig. 4) such as photocurrents into ac- 
tion potential spike trains with millimeter scale devices has been experimentally 
demonstrated s with currents from I A down to about I picoampere with coding 
noise referred to input of < 10 femtoamperes. Coding of much smaller current levels 
should be possible with smaller devices. Figure 5 clearly shows the threshold behavior 
of the ]]ID. For devices studied to date, a transition from action potential output to 
graded signal output is observed for input currents of the order of 0.5 picoamperes 1.s

This transition is remarkably well described in yon Neumann's discussion 5,6 of 
the mixed character of neural elements which he relates to the concept of sublimi- 
nal stimulation levels which are too low to produce the stereotypical all-or-nothing 
response. Neural network modelers frequently adopt viewpoints which ignore this 
interesting mixed character. The yon Neumann viewpoint links the mixed character 
to concepts of nonlinear dynamics in a way which is not apparent in recent neural 
network modeling literature. The scaling down of IMD size should result in even 
lower current requirements for all-or-nothing response. 
DEVICE PHYSICS 
Recently, neuronlike action potential transients in ]]VIDs have been the subject 
of considerable research s,4,7,s,9,t�,lt,t2,1s. In the simple circuits of Fig. 1, the IMD 
gives rise to a spontaneous neuronlike spiketrain output. Between pulses, the IMD is 
polarized in the sense that it is in a low conductance state with a substantial voltage 
occurring across it, even though it is forward biased. The low conductance has been 
attributed to small interfacial work functions due to band offsets at the n+-n and 
p+-n interfaces s. 
Low temperatures inhibit thermionic injection of electrons and holes into the 
n-region from the n+-layer and p+-layer impurity bands TM. Pulses are caused by 
204 
switching to depolarized states with low diode potential drops and large injection 
currents which are believed to be triggered by the slow buildup of a small thermionic 
injection current from the n+-layer into the n-region. The injection current can cause 
impact ionization of n-region donor impurities resulting in an increasingly positive 
space charge which further enhances the injection current to the point where the IMD 
abruptly switches to the low conductance state with large injection current. Switching 
times are typically under lOOns. Charging of the load capacitance C� cuts off the 
large injection current and resets the diode to its low conductance state. The load 
capacitor C� then discharges through R�. During the C� discharging time constant 
R�C� the voltage across the ]MD itself is low and therefore the bias voltage would 
have to be raised substantially to cause further firing. Thus, R�C� is analogous to 
the refractory period of a neuron. The output pulses of an ]MD generally have about 
the same amplitude while the rate of pulsing varies over a wide range depending on 
the bias voltage and the presence of electromagnetic radiation. 7,s,1�

REAL TIME PARALLEL ASYNCHRONOUS PROCESSING 
The devices described here could form the hardware basis for a parallel asyn- 
chronous processor in much the same way that transistors form the basis for digital 
computers. The devices could be used to construct networks which could perform real 
time signal processing. Pulse propagation through silicon chips (parallel firethrough, 
see Fig. 7) as opposed to the lateral planar propagation in conventional integrated 
circuits has been proposed? This would permit the use of laminar, stacked wafer 
architectures. See Fig. 6. 
Such architectures would eliminate the serial processing limitations of stan- 
dard processors which utilize multiplexing and charge transfer. There are additional 
advantages in terms of elimination of pre-amplifiers and reduction in power consump- 
tion. The approach would utilize the low power, low noise devices 1� described here 
to perform input signal-to-frequency conversion in every processing channel.

OUTPUTS 
the natural emulation of neuron features means that the approach described here 
would be especially advantageous for very large neural networks, e.g. systems com- 
parable to supercomputers in which power dissipation and system complexity are im- 
portant considerations. The power consumption of large scale analog t6 and digital t7 
systems is always a major concern. For example, the power consumption of the 
CRAY XMP-48 is of the order of 300 kilowatts. For the devices described here, the 
power consumption is very low. For these devices, we have observed quiescent power 
drains of about I nW/cm 2 and pulse power consumption of about 500 nJ/pulse[cm:.
