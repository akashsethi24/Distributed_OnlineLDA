Abstract 
We have been studying the performance of a bottlenosed dolphin on 
a delayed matching-to-sample task to gain insight into the processes and 
mechanisms that the animal uses during echolocation. The dolphin 
recognizes targets by emitting natural sonar signals and listening to the 
echoes that return. This paper describes a novel neural network 
architecture, called an integrator gateway network, that we have de- 
veloped to account for this performance. The integrator gateway 
network combines information from multiple echoes to classify targets 
with about 90% accuracy. In contrast, a standard backpropagation 
network performed with only about 63% accuracy. 
1. INTRODUCTION 
The study of animals can provide a very important source of information for the de- 
sign of automated artificial systems such as robots and autonomous vehicles. Animals 
have evolved in a real world, solving real problems, such as gathering and interpreting 
essential information. We call the process of using animal studies to inform the de- 
sign of artificial systems biomimetics because the artificial systems are designed as 
mimics of biological ones.

MANCE 
Dolphin echolocation clicks emerge from the rounded forehead or melon as a highly 
directional sound beam with 3 dB (half power) beamwidths of approximately 10 � in 
both the vertical and horizontal planes (Au, et al., 1986). Echolocation clicks have 
peak energy at frequencies from 40 to 130 kHz with source levels of 220 dB re: 1 u Pa 
at I m (Au, 1980; Moore & Pawloski, 1990). Bottlenosed dolphins have excellent di- 
rectionally selective hearing (Au & Moore, 1984), spanning over 7 octaves, and can 
detect frequencies as high as 150 kHz (Johnson, 1966). 
3. BEHAVIORAL METHODS 
We have been studying the performance of a bottlenosed dolphin on an echolocation 
delayed matching-to-sample (DMTS) task (e.g., Nachtigall, 1980; Nachtigall, et al., 
1985; Roitblat, et al., 1990a; Moore, ct al., 1990). In this task a sample stimulus is 
presented underwater to a blindfolded dolphin. The dolphin is allowed to echolocate 
on this object ad lib. The object is then removed from the water, and after a short 
delay, three alternative objects are presented (the comparison stimuli). One of these 
objects is identical to (matches) the sample object, and the dolphin is required to in- 
dicate the matching stimulus by touching a response wand in front of it. The object 
that serves as sample and the location of the correct match vary randomly from trial 
to trial. 
Recent work has concentrated on performance with three sample and comparison 
stimuli: (a) a PVC plastic tube, (b) a water-filled stainless steel sphere, and (c) a solid 
aluminum cone (see Roitblat, et al., 1990a). On average the dolphin used 37.2 clicks 
to identify the sample, and an average of 4.2 scans to examine the three comparison 
stimuli. A scan is a train of clicks to a single stimulus ended either by the initiation of 
a scan to another stimulus or by a cessation of clicking 
The dolphin's scanning patterns were modeled using sequential sampling theory (see 
also Roitblat, 1984). Simulations based on this model provide a reasonably good ap- 
proximation of the dolphin's performance (Roitblat, et al., 1990a). The simulation 
differed from the dolphin's actual performance, however, in that it was less variable 
than the live dolphin. We return to the problem of accounting for this difference in 
variability below after considering some models of the details of echo recognition. 
4. ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS 
We have developed a series of neural-network models of dolphin echolocation pro- 
cessing (see also Gorman and Sejnowski, 1988). We (Moore, et al., 1990; Roitblat, et 
al., 1989) trained a counterpropagation network (Hecht-Nielsen, 1987, 1988) to clas- 
sify echoes represented by their spectra into categories corresponding to each of the 
stimuli in our current stimulus set. The network correctly classified more than 95% of 
these spectra. This classification suggests two things. First, the spectral information

present in the echoes was sufficient to identify the targets on which the dolphin was 
echolocating. Second, only a single echo was necessary to classify the target. Al- 
though the network could identify the target with only a single echo, the dolphin con- 
currently performing the same task emitted many clicks in identifying the same tar- 
gets. Further investigation revealed that the clicks emitted by the dolphin were more 
variable than our initial sample suggested (Roitblat, et al., 1990b). This variability 
provides one possible explanation for the high performance level, and low variability 
of our initial model. 
4.1 THE INTEGRATOR GATEWAY NETWORK 
Our integrator gateway network incorporates features of the sequential sampling 
model described earlier, including the assumptions that the dolphin averages or sums 
spectral information from successive echoes and continues to emit clicks and collect 
returning echoes until it can classify the target producing those echoes with sufficient 
confidence. It mimics the dolphin's strategy of using multiple echoes to identify each 
target. Figure 1 shows schematic of the Integrator Gateway Network. 
Network inputs were 30-dimensional spectral vectors containing echo amplitudes in 
1.95 kHz wide frequency bins. The echoes were captured and digitized during the dol- 
phin's matching-to-sample performance. In addition to the 30 bins of spectral infor- 
mation, each echo was also marked as to whether the echo was (1.00) or was not

(0.00) at the start of an echo train. Recall that the dolphin directs a series of clicks to 
one target at a time, so it seemed plausible to include information marking the start of 
a click train. The frequency inputs were then passed to a scalar unit and to the inte- 
grator layer. The integrator layer also contained 30 units, connected to the frequency 
units in the input layer in a corresponding one-to-one pattern. The connections to the 
scalar unit were fixed at I/n, where n is the number of frequency inputs. The weights 
to the integrator layer were fixed at 1.00. The output of the scalar unit, i.e., the sum 
of all of its inputs, was passed to each unit in the integrator layer via a fixed weight of 
-1.00. The effect of this scalar unit was to subtract the average activity of the input 
layer (neglecting the start-of-train marker) from the inputs to the integrator layer. 
This subtraction preserved all of the relative activity information present in the inputs, 
but kept the inputs within a manageable range. 
The elements in the integrator layer computed a cumulative sum of the inputs they 
received. The role of this layer was to accumulate and integrate information from 
successive echo spectra. The outputs of the integrator layer were passed via fixed 
connections with 1.00 weights to corresponding units in the gateway layer. The inte- 
grator layer and the gateway layer each contained the same number of units. Each 
unit in the gateway layer acted as a reset for the corresponding unit in the integrator 
layer, and connected back to its corresponding unit with a weight of -1.00. Each unit 
in the gateway layer employed a multiplicative transfer function that multiplied the 
input from its corresponding unit in the integrator layer with the value of the start-of- 
train marker. Because this marker had 1.00 activity at the start of a scan and 0.00 ac- 
tivity otherwise, it functioned as a reset signal, causing the units in the integrator layer 
to be reset to 0.00 at the start of every scan; their previous activation level was sub- 
tracted from their input. 
The output of the integrator layer also led via variable-weight connections to each of 
the elements in the feature layer. The same kind of scalar unit that intervened be- 
tween the input layer and integrator layer was also used between the integrator layer 
and feature layer to subtract the average activity of the integrator layer, again to keep 
activations within a manageable range. The outputs of the feature layer led via vari- 
able-weight connections to the classifier layer. The elements in these two layers con- 
tained sigmoid transfer functions and were trained using a standard cumulative back- 
propagation algorithm with the epoch duration set to the number of training samples 
(60). 
The training set consisted of six sets of ten successive echoes each, selected from the 
ends of haphazardly chosen echo trains. An equal number of cone, tube, and sphere 
echoes were used. The training set was a relatively small subset (4%) of the total set 
of available echoes (1,335).
