Abstract 
Single nerve cells with static properties have traditionally been viewed 
as the building blocks for networks that show emergent phenomena. In 
contrast to this approach, we study here how the overall network activity 
can control single cell parameters such as input resistance, as well as time 
and space constants, parameters that are crucial for excitability and spario- 
temporal integration. Using detailed computer simulations of neocortical 
pyramidal cells, we show that the spontaneous background firing of the 
network provides a means for setting these parameters. The mechanism 
for this control is through the large conductance change of the membrane 
that is induced by both non-NMDA and NMDA excitatory and inhibitory 
synapses activated by the spontaneous background activity.

time-dependent conductances can give rise to adaptation, burst-firing, and other 
non-linear effects. The extent of temporal integration is determined by the time 
constant, and spatial integration by the leakiness of the membrane. It is unclear 
which cell properties are computationally significant and which are not relevant 
for information processing, even though they may be important for the proper 
functioning of the cell. However, it is crucial to understand the function of the 
component cells in order to make relevant abstractions when modeling biological 
systems. In this paper we study how the spontaneous background firing of the 
network as a whole can strongly influence some of the basic integration properties 
of single cells. 
1.1 Controlling parameters via background synaptic activity 
� � � dV � 
The input resastance, Rn, s defined as 7/', where dV s the steady state voltage 
change in response to a small current step of amplitude dI. Jin will vary throughout 
the cell, and is typically much larger in a long, narrow dendrite than in the soma. 
However, the somatic input resistance is more relevant to the spiking behavior of 
the neuron, since spikes are initiated at or close to the soma, and hence 
(henceforth simply referred to as Ri,) will tell us something of the sensitivity of the 
cell to charge reaching the soma. 
The time constant, r,, for a passive membrane patch is R,. C,, the membrane 
resistance times the membrane capacitance. For membranes containing voltage. 
dependent non-linearities, exponentials are fitted to the step response and the 
largest time constant is taken to be the membrane time constant. A large time 
constant implies that any injected charge leaks away very slowly, and hence the cell 
has a longer memory of previous events. 
The parameters discussed above (Ri,, r,n) clearly have computational significance 
and it would be convenient to be able to chane them dynamically. Both depend 
directly on the membrane conductance Gm= /F', so any change in Gm will change 
the .parameters. Traditionally, however, Gm has been viewed as static, so these 
parameters have also been considered static. How can we change Grn dynamically? 
In traditional models, Gm has two components: active (time- and voltage. 
dependent) conductances and a passive leak conductance. Synapses are mod- 
eled as conductance changes, but if only a few are activated, the cable structure 
of the cell will hardly change at all. However, it is well known that neocortical 
neurons spike spontaneously, in the absence of sensory stimuli, at rates from 0 to 
10 Hz. Since neocortical neurons receive on the order of 5,000 to 15,000 excitatory 
synapses (Larkman, 1991), this spontaneous firing is likely to add up to a large total 
conductance (Holmes & Woody, 1989). This synaptic conductance becomes crucial 
if the non-synaptic conductance components are small. Recent evidence show in- 
deed that the non-synaptic conductances are relatively small (when the cell is not 
spiking) (Anderson et al., 1990). Our model uses a leak R, = 100,000 klcrn , 
instead of more conventional values in the range of 2,500-10,000 klcrn . These 
two facts, high R, and synaptic background activity, allow Ri, and r,n to change 
by more than ten-fold, as described below in this paper.

MODEL 
A typical layer V pyramidal cell (fig. 2) in striate cortex was filled with HRP dur- 
ing in vivo experiments in the anesthetized, adult cat (Douglas et al., 1991). The 
3-D coordinates and diameters of the dendritic tree were measured by a computer- 
assisted method and each branch was replaced by a single equivalent cylinder. This 
morphological data was fed into a modified version of NEURON, an efficient sin- 
gle cell simulator developed by Hines (1989). The dendrites were passive, while the 
soma contained seven active conductance. s, underlying spike generation, adaptation, 
and slow onset for weak stimuli. The model included two sodium conductances (a 
fast spiking current and a slower non-inactivating current), one calcium conduc- 
tance, and four potassium conductances (delayed rectifier, slow 'M' and 'A' type 
currents, and a calcium-dependent current). The active conductances were modeled 
using a Hodgkin-Huxley-like formalism. 
The model used a total of 5,000 synapses. The synaptic conductance change 
in time was modeled with an alpha function, g(t) = 'ete-t/t,''. 4,000 
synapses were fast excitatory non-NMDA or AMPA-type (tpek = 1.5 rnsec, gpek = 
0.5 nS, Eo = 0 mV), 500 were medium-slow inhibitory GABAA (tpa = 
10 msec, gpak  1.0 nS, Eeo = -70 mV), and 500 were slow inhibitory GABAB 
(tpea = 40 msec, gpea = 0.1 nS, Ereo = -95 mV). The excitatory synapses were 
ls concentrated towards the soma, while the inhibitory ones were more so. For a 
more detailed dcription of the model, see Bernander et al. (1991).

3.1 Ri,and ', change with backgromd frequency 
Fig. 1 illustrates what happens to R/,and ', when the synaptic background activ- 
ities of all synaptic types are varied simultaneously. In the absence of any synaptic 
input, R/,= 110 Mfi and 'm = 80 rnsec. At 1 Hz background activity, on av- 
erage 5 synaptic events are impinging on the cell every rnsec, contributing a total 
of 24 nS to the somatic input conductance Gin Because of the reversal potential 
of the excitatory synapses (0 mV), the membrane potential throughout the cell is 
pulled towards more depolarizing potentials, activating additional active currents. 
Although these trends continue as f is increased, the largest change can be observed 
between 0 and 2 Hz. 
Figure 2: Spatial integration as a function of background frequency. 
Each dendrite has been stretched so that its apparent length corresponds to its 
electrotonic length. The synaptic background frequency was 0 Hz (left) and 2 Hz 
(right). The scale bar corresponds to 1 A (length constant). 
Activating synaptic input has two distinct effects: the conductance of the post- 
synaptic membrane increases and the membrane is alepolarized. The system can, 
at least in principle, independently control these two effects by differentially vary- 
ing the spontaneous firing frequencies of excitatory versus inhibitory inputs. Thus, 
increasing f selectively for the GABAB inhibition will further increase the mem- 
brane conductance but move the resting potential towards more hyperpolarizing

potentials. 
Note that the 0 Hz case corresponds to experiments made with in vitro slice prepa- 
rations or culture. In this case incoming fibers have been cut off and the spontaneous 
firing rate is very small. Careful studies have shown very large values for Ri, and 
'm under these circumstances (e.g. Spruston & Johnston, 1991). In vivo prepara- 
tions, on the other hand, leave the cortical circuitry intact and much smaller values 
of Ri, and rm are usually recorded. 
3.2 Spatial integration 
Varying synaptic background activity can have a significant impact on the electro- 
tonic structure of the cell (fig. 2). We plot the electrotonic distance of any particular 
point from the cell body, that is the sum of the electrotonic length's 
associated with each dendritic segment i, where ;j =  is the electrotonic 
length constant of compartment j, lj its anatomical length and the sum is taken 
over all compartments between the soma and compartment i. 
Increasing the synaptic background activity from f = 0 to f = 2 Hz has the effect 
of stretching the distance of any particular synapse to the soma by a factor of 
about 3, on average. Thus, while a distal synapse has an associated L value of 
about 2.6 at 2 Hz it shrinks to 1.2 if all network activity is shut off, while for a 
synapse at the tip of a basal dendrite, L shrinks from 0.7 to 0.2. In fact, the EPSP 
induced by a single excitatory synapse at that location goes from 39 to 151 /V, a 
decrease of about 4. Thus, when the overall network activity is low, synapses in the 
superficial layer of cortex could have a significant effect on somatic discha
