Abstract 
We have designed a neural network which detects the direction of ego- 
motion from optic flow in the presence of eye movements (Lappe and 
Rauschecker, 1993). The performance of the network is consistent with 
human psychophysical c!t_a and its output neurons show great similarity 
to triple component cells in area MSTd of monkey visual cortex. We 
now show that by using assumptions about the kind of eye movements 
that the observer is likely to perform, our model can generate various 
other cell types found in MSTd as well. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
Following the ideas of Gibson in the 1950's a number of studies in human psychophysics 
have demonstrated that optic flow can be used effectively for navigation in space (Rieger and 
Toet, 1985; Stone and Pearone, 1991; Warren et aL, 1988). In search for the neural basis of 
optic flow processing, an area in the cat's extrastriate visual cortex (PMLS) was described 
as having a centrifugal organi7on of neuronal direction preferences, which suggested 
an involvement of area PMLS in the processing of expanding flow fields (Rauschecker 
et al., 1987; Brenner and Rauschecker, 1990). Recently, neurons in the dorsal part of 
the roedial superior temporal area (MSTd) in monkeys have been described that respond 
to various combinations of large expanding/contracting, rotating, or shifting dot patterns 
(Duffy and Wurtz, 1991; Tanaka and Saito, 1989). Cells in MSTd show a continuum 
of response properties ranging from selectivity for only one movement pattern (single

component cells) to selectivity for one mode of each of the three movement types (triple 
component cells). An interesting property of many MSTd cells is their position invadance 
(Andersen et al., 1990). A sizable proportion of cells, however, do change their selectivity 
when the stimulus is displaced by several tens of degrees of visual angle, and their position 
dependence sc.,.,'ns to be correlated with the type ofmovement selectivity (Duffy and Wurtz, 
1991; Orban et al., 1992): It is most common for triple component cells and occurs least 
often in single component cells. Taken together, the wide range of directional tuning and 
the apparent lack of specificity for the spatial position of a stimulus s---n. to suggest, that 
MSTd cells do not possess the selectivity needed to explain the high accuracy of human 
observers in psychophysical experiments. Our simulation results, however, demonstrate 
that a population encoding can be used, in which individual neurons are rather broadly 
tuned while the whole network gives vy accurate results. 
2 THE NETWORK MODEL 
The major projections to area MST originate from the middle temporal area (MT). Area 
MT is a well known area of monkey cortex specialized for the processing of visual motion. 
It contains a retinotopic representation of local movement directions (Allman and Kaas, 
1971; Maunsell and Van Essen, 1983). In our model we assume that area MT comprises a 
population encoding of the optic flow and that area MST uses this input from MT to extract 
the heading direction. Therefore, the network consists of two layers. In the first layer, 300 
optic flow vectors at random locations within 50 degrees of eccentricity are representecL 
Each flow vector is encoded by a population of directionally selective neurons. It has bcca 
shown previously that a biologically plausible population encoding like this can also be 
modelled by a neural network (Wang et al., 1989). For simplicity we use only four neurons 
to represent an optic flow vector O as

with equally spaced preferred directions ei} = (cosOrk/2),sin(rk/2)) t. A neuron's 
response to a flow vector of direction &i and speed Oi is given by the tuning curve 
0i co(Oi - 
sik - 0 
if cos(4i - a'k/2) > 0 
otherwise. 
The second layer contains a retinotopic grid of possible translational heading directions 
Each direction is represented by a population ofneurons, whose summed activities give the 
likelihood that Tj is the correct heading. The perceived direction is finally chosen to be 
the one that has the highest population activity. 
The calculation of this likelihoodis based on the subspace algorithm by Heeger and Jepson 
(1992). It employs the minimization of a residual function over all possible heading 
directions. The neuronal populations in the second layer evaluate a related function that 
is maximal for the correct heading. The subspace algorithm works as follows: When 
an observer moves through a static environment all points in space share the same six 
motion parameters, the translation T = (T, Tv, Tz)t and the rotation fl = (f/,, f/v, f/z )t- 
The optic flow 0(z, V) is the projection ofthe movement of a 3D-point (g, Y, Z) t onto the 
retina, which, for simplicity, is modelled as an image plane. In a viewer centered coordinate

system the optic flow can be written as:

a 2m x (m + 3) matrix. Heeger and Jepson (1992) show that the heading direction can be 
recovered by minimizing the residual function 
R(T)- IIO'Cl(T)112. 
In this equation CI(T) is defined as follows: Provided that the colnnms of C(T) are 
2rn 
linearly independent, they form a basis of an (m + 3)-dimmsional subspace of the 7 , 
which is called therange ofC (T). Thematrix C � (T) spans theremaining (2m- (m+ 3))- 
dimensional subspace which is called the orthogonal complement of C(T). Every vector 
in the orthogonal complement of C(T) is orthogonal to every vector in the range of C(T). 
In the network, the population of neurons representing a certain Tj shall be maximally 
excited when R(Tj) = 0. Two steps are necessary to accomplish this. First an individual 
neuron evaluates part of the argument ofR(Tj ) by picking out one of the column vectors of 
C - (Tj), denoted by Cp (Tj), and computing OtCp (Tj). This is done in the following 
way: m first layer populations are chosen to form the neuron's input receptive field. The 
neuron's output is given by the sigmoid function 
rn 4 
ujl = g(E E Jij,lsik -- !), (5) 
i----1 
in which Jij:t denotes the strength of the synapfic connection between the 1-th output 
neuron in the second layer population representing heading direction Tj and the k-th input 
neuron in the first layer population representing the optic flow vector Oi, ! denotes the 
threshold. For the synapfic strengths we require that:

i=1 k----1 
( -f 0 
A(x,y) = -f y f + y2/f x -x 
depending only on coordinates (x, y) in the image plane and on the focal length f (Heeger 
and Jepson, 1992). In trying to estimate T, given the optic flow 0, we first have to note 
that the unknowns Z(x, y) and T are multiplied together. They can thus not be determined 
independently so that the translation is considered a unit vector pointing in the direction of 
heading. Eq. (2) now contains six unknowns, Z (x, y), T and f, but only two measurements 
02 and Oy. Therefore, flow vectors from m distinct image points are combined into the 
matrix equation 
{9 = C(T)q, (3) 
where O = (01,..., 0,)  is a 2m-dimensional vector consisting of the components of 
them image velocities, q = (m +

At a single image location i this is: 
4 t fCi,_l_2i_l(Tj) I 
k=l 
Substituting eq. (1) we find: 
= J' 
Therefore we set the synaptic strengths to: 
Then, whenever Tj is compatible with the measured optic flow, i.e. when {9 is in the range 
of C (Tj), the neuron reeves a net input of zero. In the second step, another neuron ujl, is 
constructed so that the sum of the activities of the two neurons is maximal in this situation. 
Bothneurons are connected to the same set of image locations but their connection strengths 
satisfy Jijll, = -Jijlt. In addition, the threshold p is given a slightly negative value. Then 
both their sigmoid transfer functions overlap at zero input, and the sum has a single peak. 
Finally, the neurons in every second layer population are organized in such matched pairs 
so that each population j generates its maximal activity when R(Tj) = 0. 
In simulations, our network is able to compute the direction of heading with a mean eaxor 
of less than one degree in agreeanent with human psychophysical data (see Lappe and 
Rauschecker, 1993). Like heading detection in human observers it functions over a wide 
range of speeds, it works with sparse flow fields and it needs depth in the visual environment 
when eye movements are performed. 
3 DIFFERENT RESPONSE SELECTIVITIES 
For the remainder of this paper we will focus on the second layer neuron's response proper- 
ties by carrying out simulations analogous to neurophysiological experiments (Andersen et 
al., 1990; Duffy and Wurtz, 1991; Orban etal., 1992). A single neuron is constructed that 
receives input from 30 random image locations forming a 60 x 60 degree receptive field. 
The receptive field occupies the lower left quadrant of the visual field and also includes 
the fovea (Fig. 1A). The neuron is then presented with shilling, expanding/contracting and 
rotating optic flow patterns. The center (z�, y�) ofthe expanding/contracting and rotating 
patterns is varied over the 100 x 100 degree visual field in order to test the position depen- 
dence of the neuron's responses. Directional ttming is assessed via the direction  of the 
shitting patterns. All patterns are obtained by choosing suitable translations and rotations 
in eq. (2). For ins
