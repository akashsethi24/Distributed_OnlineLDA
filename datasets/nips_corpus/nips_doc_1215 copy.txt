Abstract 
We describe the implementation of a hidden Markov model state 
decoding system, a component for a wordspotting speech recogni- 
tion system. The key specification for this state decoder design is 
microwatt power dissipation; this requirement led to a continuous- 
time, analog circuit implementation. We characterize the operation 
of a 10-word (81 state) state decoder test chip. 
1. INTRODUCTION 
In this paper, we describe an analog implementation of a common signal processing 
block in pattern recognition systems: a hidden Markov model (HMM) state decoder. 
The design is intended for applications such as voice interfaces for portable devices 
that require micropower operation. In this section, we review HMM state decoding 
in speech recognition systems. 
An HMM speech recognition system consists of a probabilistic state machine, and 
a method for tracing the state transitions of the machine for an input speech wave- 
form. Figure i shows a state machine for a simple recognition problem: detect- 
ing the presence of keywords (Yes, No) in conversational speech (non-keyword 
speech is captured by the Filler state). This type of recognition where keywords 
are detected in unconstrained speech is called wordspotting (Lippmann et al., 1994).

Our goal during speech recognition is to trace out the most likely path through this 
state machine that could have produced the input speech waveform. This problem 
can be partially solved in a local fashion, by examining short (80 ms. window) 
overlapping (15 ms. frame spacing) segments of the speech waveform. We estimate 
the probability b (n) that the signal in frame n was produced by state i, using static 
pattern recognition techniques. 
To improve the accuracy of these local estimates, we need to integrate information 
over the entire word. We do this by creating a set of state variables for the machine, 
called likelihoods, that are incrementally updated at every frame. Each state i has 
a real-valued likelihood bi(n) associated with it. Most states in Figure i have a 
stereotypical form: a state i that has a self-loop input, an input from state i - 1, 
and an output to state i + 1, with the self-loop and exit transitions being equally 
probable. For states in this topology, the update rule 
log(bi(n)) -- log(b,(n)) -{- log(b,(n - 1) -{- b,_x (n - 1)) 
(1) 
lets us estimate the log likelihood value log(b(n)) for the state i; a log encoding 
is used to cope with the large operating range of bi(n) values. Log likelihoods are 
negative numbers, whose magnitudes increase with each frame. We limit the range 
of log likelihood values by using a renormalization technique: if any log likelihood 
in the system falls below a minimum value, a positive constant is added to all log 
likelihoods in the machine. 
Figure 2 shows a complete system which uses HMM state decoding to perform 
wordspotting. The Feature Generation and Probability Generation blocks com- 
prise the static pattern recognition system, producing the probabilities bi (n) at each 
frame. The State Decode block updates the log likelihood variables log(b,(n)). 
The Word Detect block uses a simple online algorithm to flag the occurrence of a 
word. Keyword end-state log likelihoods are subtracted by the filler log likelihood, 
and when this difference exceeds a fixed threshold a keyword is detected.

2. ANALOG CIRCUITS FOR STATE DECODING 
Figure 3a shows an analog discrete-time implementation of Equation 1. The delay 
element (labeled Z -) acts as a edge-triggered sampled analog delay, with full-scale 
voltage input and output. The delay element is clocked at the frame rate of the 
state decoder (15 ms. clock period). The combinatorial analog circuits must 
settle within the clock period. A clock period of 15 ms. allows a relatively long 
settling time, which enables us to make extensive use of submicroampere currents 
in the circuit design. The microwatt power consumption design specification drives 
us to use such small currents. As a result of submicroampere circuit operation, the 
MOS transistors in Figure 3a are operating in the weak-inversion regime.

Equation i uses two types of variables: probabilities and log likelihoods. In the 
implementation shown in Figure 3, we choose unidirectional current as the signal 
type for probability, and large-signal voltage as the signal type for log likelihood. 
We can understand the dimensional scaling of these signal types by analyzing the 
floating-well transistor labeled (4) in Figure 3a. The equation 
V,- log(b,(n)) = V,- log(b,(n)) + g,(n - 1) + V,- log(Io ) 
(2) 
describes the behavior of this transistor, where V. = (Vo/r)ln(10), g,(n- 1) is 
the output of the delay element, and Io,  and Vo are MOS parameters. Both Io 
and  in Equation 2 are functions of Vb. However, the floating-well topology of the 
transistor ensures Vb = 0 for this device. 
The input probability bi(n) is scaled by the unidirectional current Ih, defining the 
current flowing through the transistor. The current Ih is the largest current that 
keeps the transistor in the weak-inversion regime. We define It to be the small- 
est value for Iabi(n) that allows the circuit to settle within the clock period. The 
ratio Ia/It sets the supported range of hi(n). In the test-chip fabrication process, 
Ia/It  10,000 is feasible, which is sufficient for accurate wordspotting. Likewise, 
the unitless log(qS,(n)) is scaled by the voltage V, to form a large-signal voltage 
encoding of log likelihood. A nominal value for V, is 85mV in the test-chip pro- 
cess. To support a log likelihood range of 35 (the necessary range for accurate 
wordspotting) a large-signal voltage range of 3 volts (i.e. 35V,) is required. 
The term g(n - 1) in Equation 2 is shown as the output of the circuit labeled 
(1) in Figure 3a. This circuit computes a function that approximates the desired 
expression V.log(b,(n- 1) q- b,_l(n- 1)), if the transistors in the circuit operate 
in the weak-inversion regime. 
The computed log likelihood log(b,(n)) in Equation 1 decreases every frame. The 
circuit shown in Figure 3a does not behave in this way: the voltage V.log(c),(n)) 
increases every frame. This difference in behavior is attributable to the constant 
term V. log(Ia/Io) in Equation 2, which is not present in Equation 1, and is always 
larger than the negative contribution from V. log(b(n)). Figure 3b adds a new 
circuit (labeled (2)) to Figure 3a, that allows the constant term in Equation 2 to 
be altered under control of the binary input V. If V is Vaa, the circuit in Figure 3b 
is described by 
V. log(b,(n)) = V. log(b,(n))+ g,(n- 1)+ V.. log(-j- ), 
where the term V. log((Ihlo)/I) should be less than or equal to zero. 
grounded, the circuit is described by 
(3a) 
If V is 
V. log(b,(n)) = V. log(b,(n)) + g,(n - 1) + V. log(I), 
(3b) 
where the term V,, log(Ia/I,) should have a positive value of at least several hundred 
millivolts. The goal of this design is to create two different operational modes for 
the system. One mode, described by Equation 3a, corresponds to the normal state 
decoder operation described in Equation 1. The other mode, described by Equation

3b, corresponds to the renormalization procedure, where a positive constant is added 
to all likelihoods in the system. During operation, a control system alternates 
between these two modes, to manage the dynamic range of the system. 
Section 1 formulated HMMs as discrete-time systems. However, there are significant 
advantages in replacing the Z -1 element in Figure 3b with a continuous-time delay 
circuit. The switching noise of a sampled delay is eliminated. The power consump- 
tion and cell area specifications also benefit from continuous-time implementation. 
Fundamentally, a change from discrete-time to continuous-time is not only an im- 
plementation change, but also an algorithmic change. Figure 3c shows a continuous- 
time state decoder whose observed behavior is qualitatively similar to a discrete-time 
decoder. The delay circuit, labeled (3), uses a linear transconductance amplifier in 
a follower-integrator configuration. The time constant of this delay circuit should 
be set to the frame rate of the corresponding discrete-time state decoder. 
For correct decoder behavior over the full range of input probability values, the 
transconductance amplifer in the delay circuit must have a wide differential-input- 
voltage linear range. In the test chip presented in this paper, an amplifier with a 
small linear range was used. To work around the problem, we restricted the input 
probability currents in our experiments to a small multiple of I. 
Figure 4 shows a state decoding system that corresponds to the grammar shown 
in Figure 1. Each numbered circle corresponds to the circuit shown in Figure 3c.
