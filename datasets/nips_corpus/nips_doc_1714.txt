Abstract 
In hyperspectral imagery one pixel typically consists of a mixture 
of the reflectance spectra of several materials, where the mixture 
coefficients correspond to the abundances of the constituting ma- 
terials. We assume linear combinations of reflectance spectra with 
some additive normal sensor noise and derive a probabilistic MAP 
framework for analyzing hyperspectral data. As the material re- 
flectance characteristics are not know a priori, we face the problem 
of unsupervised linear unmixing. The incorporation of different 
prior information (e.g. positivity and normalization of the abun- 
dances) naturally leads to a family of interesting algorithms, for 
example in the noise-free case yielding an algorithm that can be 
understood as constrained independent component analysis (ICA). 
Simulations underline the usefulness of our theory. 
i Introduction 
Current hyperspectral remote sensing technology can form images of ground surface 
reflectance at a few hundred wavelengths simultaneously, with wavelengths ranging 
from 0.4 to 2.5m and spatial resolutions of 10-30m. The applications of this 
technology include environmental monitoring and mineral exploration and mining. 
The benefit of hyperspectral imagery is that many different objects and terrain 
types can be characterized by their spectral signature. 
The first step in most hyperspectral image analysis systems is to perform a spectral 
unmixing to determine the original spectral signals of some set of prime materials. 
The basic difficulty is that for a given image pixel the spectral reflectance patterns 
of the surface materials is in general not known a priori. However there are gen- 
eral physical and statistical priors which can be exploited to potentially improve 
spectral unmixing. In this paper we address the problem of unmixing hyperspectral 
imagery through incorporation of physical and statistical priors within an unsuper- 
vised Bayesian framework. 
We begin by first presenting the linear superposition model for the reflectances 
measured. We then discuss the advantages of unsupervised over supervised systems.

We derive a general maximum a posteriori (MAP) framework to find the material 
spectra and infer the abundances. Interestingly, depending on how the priors are 
incorporated, the zero noise case yields (i) a simplex approach or (ii) a constrained 
ICA algorithm. Assuming non-zero noise our MAP estimate utilizes a constrained 
least squares algorithm. The two latter approaches are new algorithms whereas the 
simplex algorithm has been previously suggested for the analysis of hyperspectral 
data. 
Linear Modeling To a first approximation the intensities X (xix) measured in 
each spectral band A = 1,... ,L for a given pixel i = 1,...,N are linear combi- 
nations of the reflectance characteristics S (Smx) of the materials ra = 1,..., M 
present in that area. Possible errors of this approximation and sensor noise are 
taken into account by adding a noise term N (nix). In matrix form this can be 
summarized as 
X--AS+N, subject to: AIM=I�, A_>0, 
(1) 
where matrix A (aim) represents the abundance of material ra in the area cor- 
responding to pixel i, with positivity and normalization constraints. Note that 
ground inclination or a changing viewing angle may cause an overall scale factor for 
all bands that varies with the pixels. This can be incorporated in the model by sim- 
ply replacing the constraint AIM= 1L with AIM _< 1� which does does not affect 
the discussion in the remainder of the paper. This is clearly a simplified model of 
the physical phenomena. For example, with spatially fine grained mixtures, called 
intimate mixtures, multiple reflectance may causes departures from this first or- 
der model. Additionally there are a number of inherent spatial variations in real 
data, such as inhomogeneous vapor and dust particles in the atmosphere, that will 
cause a departure from the linear model in equation (1). Nevertheless, in practical 
applications a linear model has produced reasonable results for areal mixtures. 
Supervised vs. Unsupervised techniques Supervised spectral unmixing re- 
lies on the prior knowledge about the reflectance patterns S of candidate surface 
materials, sometimes called endmembers, or expert knowledge and a series of semi- 
automatic steps to find the constituting materials in a particular scene. Once the 
user identifies a pixel i containing a single material, i.e. aim -- I for a given ra and 
i, the corresponding spectral characteristics of that material can be taken directly 
from the observations, i.e., Smx = xix [4]. Given knowledge about the endmembers 
one can simply find the abundances by solving a constrained least squares problem. 
The problem with such supervised techniques is that finding the correct S may re- 
quire substantial user interaction and the result may be error prone, as a pixel that 
actually contains a mixture can be misinterpreted as a pure endmember. Another 
approach obtains endmembers directly from a database. This is also problematic 
because the actual surface material on the ground may not match the database en- 
tries, due to atmospheric absorption or other noise sources. Finding close matches 
is an ambiguous process as some endmembers have very similar reflectance charac- 
teristics and may match several entries in the database. 
Unsupervised unmixing, in contrast, tries to identify the endmembers and mixtures 
directly from the observed data X without any user interaction. There are a variety 
of such approaches. In one approach a simplex is fit to the data distribution [7, 6, 2]. 
The resulting vertex points of the simplex represent the desired endmembers, but 
this technique is very sensitive to noise as a few boundary points can potentially 
change the location of the simplex vertex points considerably. Another approach by 
Szu [9] tries to find abundances that have the highest entropy subject to constraints 
that the amount of materials is as evenly distributed as possible - an assumption

which is clearly not valid in many actual surface material distributions. A relatively 
new approach considers modeling the statistical information across wavelength as 
statistically independent AR processes [1]. This leads directly to the contextual 
linear ICA algorithm [5]. However, the approach in [1] does not take into account 
constraints on the abundances, noise, or prior information. Most importantly, the 
method [1] can only integrate information from a small number of pixels at a time 
(same as the number of endmembers). Typically however we will have only a few 
endmembers but many thousand pixels. 
2 The Maximum A Posterior Framework 
2.1 A probabilistic model of unsupervised spectral unmixing 
Our model has observations or data X and hidden variables A, S, and N that 
are explained by the noisy linear model (1). We estimate the values of the hidden 
variables by using MAP 
p(A, SIX)= p(XIA'S)p(A'S) = pn(XIA'S)pa(A)ps(S) (2) 
p(X) p(X) 
with pa(A), ps(S), p,(N) as the a priori assumptions of the distributions. With 
MAP we estimate the most probable values for given priors after observing the data, 
AMAP, SMAP -- arg maxp(A, SIX ) (3) 
A,S 
Note that for maximization the constant factor p(X) can be ignored. Our first as- 
sumption, which is indicated in equation (2) is that the abundances are independent 
of the reflectance spectra as their origins are completely unrelated: (A0) A and S 
are independent. 
The MAP algorithm is entirely defined by the choices of priors that are guided by 
the problem of hyperspectral unmixing: (A1) A represent probabilities for each 
pixel i. (A2) S are independent for different material ra. (A3) N are normal i.i.d. 
for all i, . In summary, our MAP framework includes the assumptions A0-A3. 
2.2 Including Priors 
Priors on the abundances Positivity and normalization of the abundances can 
be represented as, 
pa(A) - 5(AIM -- 1N)O(A), (4) 
where 50 represent the Kronecker delta function and O 0 the step function. With 
this choice a point not satisfying the constraint will have zero a posteriori probabil- 
ity. This prior introduces no particular bias of the solutions other then abundance 
constraints. It does however assume the abundances of different pixels to be inde- 
pendent. 
Prior on spectra Usually we find systematic trends in the spectra that cause 
significant correlation. However such an overall trend can be subtracted and/or 
filtered from the data leaving only independent signals that encode the variation 
from that overall trend. For example one can capture the conditional dependency 
structure with a linear auto-regressive (AR) model and analyze the resulting inno- 
vations or prediction errors [3]. In our model we assume that the spectra represent 
independent instances of an AR process having a white innovation process era), dis- 
tributed according to pe(e). With a Toeplitz matrix T of the AR coefficients we

can write, em -- smT. The AR coefficients can be found in a preprocessing step on 
the observations X. If S now represents the innovation process itself, our prior can 
be represented as, 
34 L L 
pe(S) cr pe(ST) = II H Pe(Z 8m)dtXX' )' (5) 
m=l X=l 
Additionally Pe (e) is parameterized by a mean and scale parameter and potentially 
parameters determining the higher moments of the distributions. For brevity we 
ignore the details of the parameterization in this paper. 
Prior on the noise As outlined in the introduction there are a number of prob- 
lems that can cause the linear model
