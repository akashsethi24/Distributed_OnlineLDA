Abstract 
We present an algorithm for identifying linear patterns on a two- 
dimensional lattice based on the concept of an orientation selective 
cell, a concept borrowed from neurobiology of vision. Construct- 
ing a multi-layered neural network with fixed architecture which 
implements orientation selectivity, we define output elements cor- 
responding to different orientations, which allow us to make a se- 
lection decision. The algorithm takes into account the granularity 
of the lattice as well as the presence of noise and inefficiencies. The 
method is applied to a sample of data collected with the ZEUS 
detector at HERA in order to identify cosmic muons that leave 
a linear pattern of signals in the segmented calorimeter. A two 
dimensional representation of the relevant part of the detector is 
used. The algorithm performs very well. Given its architecture, 
this system becomes a good candidate for fast pattern recognition 
in parallel processing devices. 
I Introduction 
A typical problem in experiments performed at high energy accelerators aimed at 
studying novel effects in the field of Elementary Particle Physics is that of prese- 
lecting interesting interactions at as early a stage as possible, in order to keep the 
data volume manageable. One class of events that have to be eliminated is due to 
cosmic muons that pass all trigger conditions.

The most characteristic feature of cosmic muons is that they leave in the detector 
a path of signals aligned along a straight line. The efficiency of pattern recognition 
algorithms depends strongly on the granularity with which such a line is probed, on 
the level of noise and the response efficiency of a given detector. Yet the efficiency 
of a visual scan is fairly independent of those features [1] . This lead us to look for 
a new approach through application of ideas from the field of vision. 
The main tool that we borrow from the neuronal circuitry of the visual cortex is 
the orientation selective simple cell [2]. It is incorporated in the hidden layers of a 
feed forward neural network, possessing a predefined receptive field with excitatory 
and inhibitory connections. Using these elements we have developed [3] a method 
for identifying straight lines of varying slopes and lengths on a grid with limited 
resolution. This method is then applied to the problem of identifying cosmic muons 
in accelerator data, and compared with other tools. 
By using a network with a fixed architecture we deviate from conventional ap- 
proaches of neural networks in particle physics [4]. One advantage of this approach 
is that the number of free parameters is small, and it can, therefore, be determined 
using a small data set. The second advantage is the fact that it opens up the pos- 
sibility of a relatively simple implementation in hardware. This is an important 
feature for particle detectors, since high energy physics experiments are expected 
to produce in the next decade a flux of data that is higher than present analysis 
methods can cope with. 
II Description of the Task 
In a two-dimensional representation, the granularity of the rear part of the ZEUS 
calorimeter [6] can be emulated roughly by a 23 x 23 lattice of 20 x 20 cm 2 squares. 
While such a representation does not use the full information available in the de- 
tector, it is sufficient for our study. In our language each cell of this lattice will 
be denoted as a pixel. A pixel is activated if the corresponding calorimeter cell is 
above a threshold level predetermined by the properties of the detector.

accelerator event (middle), and an accelerator event that looks like a muon (right), 
as seen in a two dimensional projection. 
A cosmic muon, depending on its angle of incidence, activates along its linear path 
typically from 3 to 25 neighboring pixels anywhere on the 23 x 23 grid. The pattern 
of signals generated by accelerator events consists on average of 3 to 8 clusters, 
of typically 4 adjacent activated pixels, separated by empty pixels. The clusters

tend to populate the center of the 23 x 23 lattice. Due to inherent dynamics of 
the interactions under study, the distribution of clusters is not isotropic. Examples 
of events, as seen in the two-dimensional projection in the rear part of the ZEUS 
calorimeter, are shown in figure 1. 
The lattice discretizes the data and distorts it. Adding conventional noise levels, 
the decision of classification of the data into accelerator events and cosmic muon 
events is difficult to obtain through automatic means. Yet, it is the feeling of exper- 
imentalists dealing with these problems, that any expert can distinguish between 
the two cases with high efficiency (identifying a muon as such) and purity (not 
misidentifying an accelerator event). We define our task as developing automatic 
means of doing the same. 
III The Orientation Selective Neural Network 
Our analysis is based on a network of orientation selective neurons (OSNN) that 
will be described in this chapter. We start out with an input layer of pixels on a 
two dimensional grid with discrete labeling i = (x, y) of the neuron (pixel) that can 
get the values $i = i or 0, depending on whether the pixel is activated or not. 
Figure 2: Connectivity patterns for orientation selective cells on the second layer 
of the OSNN. From left to right are examples of orientations of 0, rr/4 and 5rr/8. 
Non-zero weights are defined only within a 5 x 5 grid. The dark pixels have weights 
of +1, and the grey ones have weights of-1. White pixels have zero weights. 
The input is being fed into a second layer that is composed of orientation selective 
neurons V 'a at location i with orientation 0a where c belongs to a discrete set of 
;i,a is the analog of a simple cell in the 
16 labels, i.e. 0a = crr/16. The neuron v 2 
visual cortex. Its receptive field consists of an array of dimension 5 x 5 centered at 
pixel i. Examples of the connectivity, for three different choices of c, are shown in 
Fig. 2. The weights take the values of 1,0 and -1. 
The second layer consists then of 23 x 23 x 16 neurons, each of which may be thought 
of as one of 16 orientation elements at some (x, y) location of the input layer. Next 
we employ a modified Winner Take All (WTA) algorithm, selecting the leading 
orientation c,a(i) for which the largest V/' is obtained at the given location i. 
If we find that several V/' at the same location i are close in value to the maximal 
one, we allow up to five different V 'a neurons to remain active at this stage of the 
processing, provided they all lie within a sector of c,a q- 2, or 0, q- rr/8. All 
other V ' are reset to zero. If, however, at a given location i we obtain several 
928 H. Abramowicz, D. Horn, U. Nafialy and C. Sahar-Pikielny 
large values of V'o` that correspond to non-neighboring orientations, all are being 
discarded. 
The third layer also consists of orientation selective cells. They are constructed 
with a receptive field of size 7 x 7, and receive inputs from neurons with the same 
orientation on the second layer. The weights on this layer are defined in a similar 
fashion to the previous ones, but here negative weights are assigned the value of 
-3, not -1. For linear patterns, the purpose of this layer is to fill in the holes due 
to fluctuations in the pixel activation, i.e. complete the lines of same orientation 
of the second layer. As before, we keep also here up to five highest values at each 
location, following the same WTA procedure as on the second layer. 
The fourth layer of the OSNN consists of only 16 components, Do`, each corre- 
sponding to one of the discrete orientations c. For each orientation we calculate 
the convolution of the first and third layers, D �' = '.i V'o`$i . The elements 
Do` carry the information about the number of the input pixels that contribute to a 
given orientation 0o`. Cosmic muons are characterized by high values of Do` whereas 
accelerator events possess low values, as shown in figure 3 below. 
The computational complexity of this algorithm is O(n) where n is the number of 
pixels, since a constant number of operations is performed on each pixel. There 
are basically four free parameters in the algorithm. These are the sizes of the 
receptive fields on the second and third layer and the corresponding activation 
thresholds. Their values can be tuned for the best performance, however they are 
well constrained by the spatial resolution, the noise level in the system and the 
activation properties of the input pixels. The size of the receptive field determines 
to a large extent the number of orientations allowed to survive in the modified WTA 
algorithm. 
IV OSNN and a Selection Criterion on the Training Set 
The details of the design of the OSNN and the tuning of its parameters were fixed 
while training it on a sample of 250 cosmic muons and a similar amount of acceler- 
ator events. The sample was obtained by preselection with existing algorithms and 
a visual scan as a cross-check. 
For cosmic muon events the highest value of Do`, Dmax, determines the ori
