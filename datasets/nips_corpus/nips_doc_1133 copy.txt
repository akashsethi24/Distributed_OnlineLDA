Abstract 
We study Bayesian networks for continuous variables using non- 
linear conditional density estimators. We demonstrate that use- 
ful structures can be extracted from a data set in a self-organized 
way and we present sampling techniques for belief update based on 
Markov blanket conditional density models. 
I Introduction 
One of the strongest types of information that can be learned about an unknown 
process is the discovery of dependencies and --even more important-- of indepen- 
dencies. A superior example is medical epidemiology where the goal is to find the 
causes of a disease and exclude factors which are irrelevant. Whereas complete 
independence between two variables in a domain might be rare in reality (which 
would mean that the joint probability density of variables A and B can be factored: 
p(A,B) - p(A)p(B)), conditional independence is more common and is often a 
result from true or apparent causality: consider the case that A is the cause of B 
and B is the cause of C, then p(C[A, B) -- p(C]B) and A and C are independent 
under the condition that B is known. Precisely this notion of cause and effect and 
the resulting independence between variables is represented explicitly in Bayesian 
networks. Pearl (1988) has convincingly argued that causal thinking leads to clear 
knowledge representation in form of conditional probabilities and to efficient local 
belief propagating rules. 
Bayesian networks form a complete probabilistic model in the sense that they repre- 
sent the joint probability distribution of all variables involved. Two of the powerful

features of Bayesian networks are that any variable can be predicted from any sub- 
set of known other variables and that Bayesian networks make explicit statements 
about the certainty of the estimate of the state of a variable. Both aspects are par- 
ticularly important for medical or fault diagnosis systems. More recently, learning 
of structure and of parameters in Bayesian networks has been addressed allowing 
for the discovery of structure between variables (Buntine, 1994, Heckerman, 1995). 
Most of the research on Bayesian networks has focused on systems with discrete 
variables, linear Gaussian models or combinations of both. Except for linear mod- 
els, continuous variables pose a problem for Bayesian networks. In Pearl's words 
(Pearl, 1988): representing each [continuous] quantity by an estimated magnitude 
and a range of uncertainty, we quickly produce a computational mess. [Continuous 
variables] actually impose a computational tyranny of their own. In this paper we 
present approaches to applying the concept of Bayesian networks towards arbitrary 
nonlinear relations between continuous variables. Because they are fast learners we 
use Parzen windows based conditional density estimators for modeling local depen- 
dencies. We demonstrate how a parsimonious Bayesian network can be extracted 
out of a data set using unsupervised self-organized learning. For belief update we 
use local Markov blanket conditional density models which --in combination with 
Gibbs sampling-- allow relatively efficient sampling from the conditional density of 
an unknown variable. 
2 Bayesian Networks 
This brief introduction of Bayesian networks follows closely Heckerman, 1995. Con- 
sidering a joint probability density x p(x) over a set of variables {xx,..., XN} we can 
decompose using the chain rule of probability 
N 
p(x): HP(XilXl,...,Xi_i). (1) 
i--1 
For each variable xi, let the parents of xi denoted by Pi C_ {Xl,..., Xi_l} be a set 
of variables 2 that renders xi and {Xl,..., xi-1} independent, that is 
p(xilxx, . . ., ;gi-1) ---- p(xil7i). 
(2) 
Note, that Pi does not need to include all elements of {Xl,...,Xi_i} which indi- 
cates conditional independence between those variables not included in 79i and xi 
given that the variables in 79i are known. The dependencies between the variables 
are often depicted as directed acyclic 3 graphs (DAGs) with directed arcs from the 
members of 79i (the parents) to xi (the child). Bayesian networks are a natural 
description of dependencies between variables if they depict causal relationships be- 
tween variables. Bayesian networks are commonly used as a representation of the 
knowledge of domain experts. Experts both define the structure of the Bayesian 
network and the local conditional probabilities. Recently there has been great

of continuous and discrete variables does not impose any additional difticnlties.

emphasis on learning structure and parameters in Bayesian networks (Heckerman, 
1995). Most of previous work concentrated on models with only discrete variables 
or on linear models of continuous variables where the probability distribution of all 
continuous given all discrete variables is a multidimensional Gaussian. In this paper 
we use these ideas in context with continuous variables and nonlinear dependencies.

Learning Structure and Parameters in Nonlinear 
Continuous Bayesian Networks 
Many of the structures developed in the neural network community can be used to 
model the conditional density distribution of continuous variables p(xi I)i). Under 
the usual signal-plus independent Gaussian noise model a feedforward neural net- 
work NN(.) is a conditional density model such that p(xi179i) - G(xi; NN(7)i), 
where G(x; c, (r ) is our notation for a normal density centered at c and with variance 
a. More complex conditional densities can, for example, be modeled by mixtures 
of experts or by Parzen windows based density estimators which we used in our ex- 
periments (Section 5). We will use pM(xi179i ) for a generic conditional probability 
model. The joint probability model is then 
N 
pM (x) = HpM (xi179i).

following Equations 1 and 2. Learning Bayesian networks is usually decomposed 
into the problems of learning structure (that is the arcs in the network) and of 
learning the conditional density models pM(xi179i ) given the structure 4. First as- 
sume the structure of the network is given. If the data set only contains complete 
data, we can train conditional density models pM(xi17Pi ) independently of each 
other since the log-likelihood of the model decomposes conveniently into the indi- 
vidual likelihoods of the models for the conditional probabilities. Next, consider 
two competing network structures. We are basically faced with the well-known 
bias-variance dilemma: if we choose a network with too many arcs, we introduce 
large parameter variance and if we remove too many arcs we introduce bias. Here, 
the problem is even more complex since we also have the freedom to reverse arcs. 
In our experiments we evaluate different network structures based on the model 
likelihood using leave-one-out cross-validation which defines our scoring function 
for different network structures. More explicitly, the score for network structure 
$ is Score = log(p(S)) + L cv, where p(S) is a prior over the network structures 
and L cv - D 
-k----1 lï¿½g(P M ( xk IS, X - {x k })) is the leave-one-out cross-validation log- 
likelihood (later referred to as cv-log-likelihood). X  D 
= {x }=1 is the set of training 
samples, and pM (xl$, X - {x'}) is the probability density of sample x, given the 
structure S and all other samples. Each of the terms pM(x  iS ' X - {x'}) can be 
computed from local densities using Equation 3. 
Even for sinall networks it is computationally impossible to calculate the score for all 
possible network structures and the search for the global optimal network structure 
4Differing from Heckerman we do not follow a fully Bayesian approach in which priors 
are defined on parameters and structure; a fully Bayesian approach is elegant if the oc- 
curring integqrals can be solved in closed form which is not the case for general nonlinear 
models or if data are incomplete.

is NP-hard. In the Section 5 we describe a heuristic search which is closely related to 
search strategies commonly used in discrete Bayesian networks (Heckerman, 1995). 
4 Prior Models 
In a Bayesian framework it is useful to provide means for exploiting prior knowledge, 
typically introducing a bias for simple structures. Biasing models towards simple 
structures is also useful if the model selection criteria is based on cross-validation, 
as in our case, because of the variance in this score. In the experiments we added 
a penalty per arc to the log-likelihood i.e. logp($) cx --aNA where NA is the 
number of arcs and the parameter a determines the weight of the penalty. Given 
more specific knowledge in form of a structure defined by a domain expert we 
can alternatively penalize the deviation in the arc structure (Heckerman, 1995). 
Furthermore, prior knowledge can be introduced in form of a set of artificial training 
data. These can be treated identical to real data and loosely correspond to the 
concept of a conjugate prior. 
5 Experiment 
In the experiment we used Parzen windows based conditional density estimators to 
model the conditional densities pM (xil7i) from Equation 2, i.e. 
pM (xi179i) = EkD----1G( ( goi, ')i); (goi k, ')/k), o')

where {xJ}?=x is the training set. The Gaussians in the nominator are centered 
at (x', P) which is the location of the k-th sample in t
