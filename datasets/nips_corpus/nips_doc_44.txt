Abstract 
In the visual cortex of the monkey the horizontal organization of the preferred 
orientations of orientation-selective cells follows two opposing rules: 1) neighbors tend 
to have similar orientation preferences, and 2) many different orientations are observed 
in a local region. Several orientation models which satisfy these constraints are found 
to differ in the spacing and the topological index of their singularities. Using the rate 
of orientation change as a measure, the models are compared to published experimental 
results. 
Introduction 
It has been known for some years that there exist orientation-sensitive neurons in 
the visual cortex of cats and monkeys . These cells react to highly specific patterns of 
light occurring in narrowly circumscribed regions of the visual field, i.e, the cell's 
receptive field. The best patterns for such cells are typically not diffuse levels of 
illumination, but elongated bars or edges oriented at specific angles. An individual cell 
responds maximally to a bar at a particular orientation, called the preferred orienta- 
tion. Its response declines as the bar or edge is rotated away from this preferred orien- 
tation. 
Orientation-sensitive cells have a highly regular organi?ation in primary cortex 3. 
Vertically, as an electrode proceeds into the depth of the cortex, the column of tissue 
contains cells that tend to have the same preferred orientation, at least in the upper 
layers. Horizontally, as an electrode progresses across the cortical surface, the preferred 
orientations change in a smooth, regular manner, so that the recorded orientations 
appear to rotate with distance. It is this horizontal structure we are concerned with, 
hereafter referred to as the orientation map. An orientation map is defined as a two- 
dimensional surface in which every point has associated with it a preferred orientation 
ranging from 0 � � -- 180 �. In discrete versions, such as the army of cells in the cortex or 
the discrete simulations in this paper, the orientation map will be considered to be a 
sampled version of the underlying continuous surface. The investigations of this paper 
are confined to the upper layers of macaque striate cortex. 
Detailed knowledge of the two-dimensional layout of the orientation map has 
implications for the architecture, development, and function of the visual cortex. The 
organization of orientation-sensitive cells reflects, to some degree, the organization of 
intracortical connections in striate cortex. Plausible orientation maps can be generated 
by models with lateral connections that are uniformly exhibited by all cells in the 
layer 4, or by models which presume no specific intracortical connections, only 
appropriate patterns of afferent input 6. In this paper, we examine models in which 
intracortical connections produce the orientation map but the orientation-controlling 
circuitry is not displayed by all cells. Rather, it derives from localized centers which 
are distributed across the cortical surface with uniform spacing ?,8,9.

The orientation map also represents a deformation in the retinotopy of primary 
visual cortex. Since the early sixties it has been known that V1 reflects a topographic 
map of the retina and hence the visual field �. There is some global distortion of this 
mapping ,2,s, but generally spatial relations between points in the visual field are 
maintained on the cortical surface. This well-known phenomenon is only accurate for 
a medium-grain description of V1, however. At a finer cellular level there is consider- 
able scattering of receptive fields at a given cortical location TM. The notion of the hyper- 
column s proposes that such scattering permits each region of the visual field to be 
analyzed by a population of cells consisting of all the necessary orientations and with 
inputs from both eyes. A quantitative description of the orientation map will allow 
prediction of the distances between iso-orientation zones of a particular orientation, 
and suggest how much cortical machinery is being brought to bear on the analysis of a 
given feature at a given location in the visual field. 
Models of the Orientation Map 
Hubel and Wiesel's Parallel Stripe Model 
The classic model of the orientation map is the parallel stripe model first pub- 
lished by Hubel and Wiesel in 1972 s. This model has been reproduced several times in 
their publications 3,s.7 and appears in many textbooks. The model consists of a series of 
parallel slabs, one slab for each orientation, which are postulated to be orthogonal to 
the ocular dominance stripes. The model predicts that a microelectrode advancing 
tangentially (i.e., horizontally) through the 
orientations. The rate of change, which is 
determined by the angle of the electrode 
stripes. 
tissue should encounter steadily changing 
also called the orientation drift rate 8, is 
with respect to the array of orientation 
The parallel stripe model does not account for several phenomena reported in 
long tangential penetrations through striate cortex in macaque monkeys ?,9. First, as 
pointed out by Swindale 2�, the model predicts that some penetrations will have flat or 
very low orientation drift rates over lateral distances of hundreds of micrometers. 
This is because an electrode advancing horizontally and perpendicular to the ocular 
dominance stripes (and therefore parallel to the orientation stripes) would be expected 
to remain within a single orientation column over a considerable distance with its 
orientation drift rate equal to zero. Such results have never been observed. Second, 
reversals in the direction of the orientation drift, from clockwise to counterclockwise 
or vice versa, are commonly seen, yet this phenomenon is not addressed by the parallel 
stripe model. Wavy stripes in the ocular dominace system  do not by themselves 
introduce reversals. Third, there should be a negative correlation between the orienta- 
tion drift rate and the ocularity drift rate. That is, when orientation is changing 
rapidly, the electrode should be confined to a single ocular dominance stripe (low ocu- 
larity drift rate), whereas when ocularity is changing rapidly the electrode should be 
confined to a single orientation stripe (low orientation drift rate). This is clearly not 
evident in the recent studies of Livingstone and Hubel ? (see especially their figs. 3b, 
21 & 23), where both orientation and ocularity often have high drift rates in the same 
electrode track, i.e, they show a positive correlation. Anatomical studies with 2- 
deoxyglucose also fail to show that the orientation and ocular dominance column sys o 
tems are orthogonal 2.

Centric Models and the Topological Index 
Another model, proposed by Braitenberg and Braitenberg in 19797, has the orien- 
tations arrayed radially around centers like spokes in a wheel The centers are spaced at 
distances of about 0.Sram. This model produces reversals and also the sinusoidal pro- 
gressions frequently encountered in horizontal penetrations. However this approach 
suggests other possibilities, in fact an entire class of centtic models. The organizing 
centers form discontinuities in the otherwise smooth field of orientations. Different 
topological types of discontinuity are possible, characterized by their topological 
index 23. The topological index is a parameter computed by taking a path around a 
discontinuity and recording the rotation of the field elements (figure 1). The value of 
the index indicates the amount of rotation; the sign indicates the direction of rotation. 
An index of 1 signifies that the orientations rotate through 360�; an index of 1/2 
signifies a 180 � rotation. A positive index indicates that the orientations rotate in the 
same sense as a path taken around the singularity; a negative index indicates the 
reverse rotation. 
Topological singularities are stable under orthogonal transformations, so that if 
the field elements are each rotated 90 � the index of the singularity remains unchanged. 
Thus a +1 singularity may have orientations radiating out from it like spokes from a 
wheel, or it may be at the center of a series of concentric circles. Only four types of 
discontinuities are considered here, +1, -1, +1/2, -1/2, since these are the most stable, i.e., 
their neighborhoods are characterized by smooth change.

in the same direction as a path taken around the singularity; a negative index indicates 
the reverse rotation. Orientations rotate through 360 � around +1 centers, 180 � around 
/2 centers. 
Cytochrome Oxidase Puffs 
At topological singularities the change in orientation is discontinuous, which 
violates the structure of a smoothly changing orientation map; modeHers try to 
minimize discontinuities in their models in order to satisfy the smoothness constraint. 
Interestingly, in the upper layers of striate cortex of monkeys, zones with little or no 
orientation selectivity have been discovered. These zones are notable for their high 
cytochrome oxidase reactivity 24 and have been referred to as cytochrome oxidase puffs, 
dots, spots, patches or blob 17252627. We will refer to them as puffs. If the organizing 
centers of centtic models are located in the cytochrome oxidase puffs then the discon- 
tinuities in the orientation map are effectively eliminated (but see below). Braitenberg 
has indicated 2s that the +1 centers of his model should correspond to the puffs. Dow 
and Bauer proposed a model s with +1 and -1 centers in alternating puffs. Gotz propo
