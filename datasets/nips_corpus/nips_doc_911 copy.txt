Abstract 
A model of short-term memory for serially ordered lists of verbal 
stimuli is proposed as an implementation of the 'articulatory loop' 
thought to mediate this type of memory (Baddeley, 1986). The 
model predicts the presence of a repeatable time-varying 'context' 
signal coding the timing of items' presentation in addition to a 
store of phonological information and a process of serial rehearsal. 
Items are associated with context nodes and phonemes by Hebbian 
connections showing both short and long term plasticity. Items are 
activated by phonemic input during presentation and reactivated 
by context and phonemic feedback during output. Serial selection 
of items occurs via a winner-take-all interaction amongst items, 
with the winner subsequently receiving decaying inhibition. An 
approximate analysis of error probabilities due to Gaussian noise 
during output is presented. The model provides an explanatory 
account of the probability of error as a function of serial position, 
list length, word length, phonemic similarity, temporal grouping, 
item and list familiarity, and is proposed as the starting point for 
a model of rehearsal and vocabulary acquisition. 
Introduction 
Short-term memory for serially ordered lists of pronounceable stimuli is well de- 
scribed, at a crude level, by the idea of an 'articulatory loop' (AL). This postulates 
that information is phonologically encoded and decays within 2 seconds unless re- 
freshed by serial rehearsal, see (Baddeley, 1986). It successfully accounts for (i) 
5 2 Neil Burgess 
the linear relationship between memory span s (the number of items s such that 
50% of lists of s items are correctly recalled) and articulation rate r (the number 
of items that can be said per second) in which s  2r + c, where r varies as a 
function of the items, language and development; (ii) the fact that span is lower for 
lists of phonemically similar items than phonemically distinct ones; (iii) unattended 
speech and articulatory distractor tasks (e.g. saying blah-blah-blah...) both reduce 
memory span. Recent evidence suggests that the AL plays a role in the learning of 
new words both during development and during recovery after brain traumas, see 
e.g. (Gathercole & Baddeley, 1993). Positron emission tomography studies indicate 
that the phonological store is localised in the left supramarginal gyrus, whereas sub- 
vocal rehearsal involves Broca's area and some of the motor areas involved in speech 
planning and production (Paulesu et al., 1993). 
However, the detail of the types of errors committed is not addressed by the AL 
idea. Principally: (iv) the majority of errors are 'order errors' rather than 'item 
errors', and tend to involve transpositions of neighbouring or phonemically similar 
items; (v) the probability of correctly recalling a list as a function of list length 
is a sigmoidl (vi) the probability of correctly recalling an item as a function of its 
serial position in the list (the 'serial position curve') has a bowed shape; (vii) span 
increases with the familiarity of the items used, specifically the c in s  2r + c can 
increase from 0 to 2.5 (see (Hulme et al., 1991)), and also increases if a list has been 
previously presented (the 'Hebb effect'); (viii) 'position specific intrusions' occur, 
in which an item from a previous list is recalled at the same position in the current 
list. Taken together, these data impose strong functional constraints on any neural 
mechanism implementing the AL. 
Most models showing serial behaviour rely on some form of 'chaining' mech- 
anism which associates previous states to successive states, via recurrent con- 
nections of various types. Chaining of item or phoneme representations gener- 
ates errors that are incompatible with human data, particularly (iv) above, see 
(Burgess & Hitch, 1992, Henson, 1994). Here items are maintained in serial order 
by association to a repeatable time-varying signal (which is suggested by position 
specific intrusions and is referred to below as 'context'), and by the recovery from 
suppression involved in the selection process - a modification of the 'competitive 
queuing' model for speech production (Houghton, 1990). The characteristics of 
STM for serially ordered items arise due to the way that context and phoneme 
information prompts the selection of each item. 
2 The model 
The model consists of 3 layers of artificial neurons representing context, phonemes 
and items respectively, connected by Hebbian connections with long and short term 
plasticity, see Fig. 1. There is a winner-take-all (WTA) interaction between item 
nodes: at each time step the item with the greatest input is given activation 1, and 
the others 0. The winner at the end of each time step receives a decaying inhibition 
that prevents it from being selected twice consecutively. 
During presentation, phoneme nodes are activated by acoustic or (translated) 
visual input, activation in the context layer follows the pattern shown in Fig. 1, 
item nodes receive input from phoneme nodes via connections wij. Connections

Wij(t) learn the association between the context state and the winning item, and 
wij and i learn the association with the active phonemes. During recall, the 
context layer is re-activated as in presentation, activation spreads to the item layer 
(via Wq(t)) where one item wins and activates its phonemes (via i(t)). The 
item that now wins, given both context and phoneme inputs, is output, and then 
suppressed. 
As described so far, the model makes no errors. Errors occur when Gaussian noise 
is added to items' activations during the selection of the winning item to be output. 
Errors are likely when there are many items with similar activation levels due to 
decay of connection weights and inhibition since presentation. Items may then be 
selected in the wrong order, and performance will decrease with the time taken to 
present or recall a list. 
2.1 Learning and familiarity 
Connection weights have both long and short term plasticity: Wij(t) (similarly 
wo(t ) and eq(t)) have an incremental long term component Wig(t), and a one- 
shot short term component W/ (t) which decays by a factor A per second. The net 
weight of the connection is the sum of the two components: Wq(t) = Wi (t)+Wi (t). 
Learning occurs according to: 
w6(t + s) = w6(t ) 
if c(t)ai(t) > Wq(t); 
otherwise, 
54 Neil Burgess 
Witi(t) + ecj(t)ai(t) if cj(t)ai(t) > 0; 
Wi(t + 1) = Wig(t) otherwise, (1) 
where c(t) and ai(t) are the pre- and post-connection activations, and e decreases 
with IW�)l so that the long term component saturates at some m:hum value. 
These mbdifiable connection weights are never negative. 
An item's 'familiarity' is reflected by the size of the long term components wit and 
-t of the weights storing the association with its phonemes. These components 
increase with each (error-free) presentation or recall of the item. For lists of to- 
tally unfamiliar items, the item nodes are completely interchangeable having only 
the short-term connections  to phoneme nodes that are learned at presentation. 
Whereas the presentation of a familiar item leads to the selection of a particular 
item node (due to the weights wj) and, during output, this item will activate its 
phonemes more strongly due to the weights ;. Unfamiliar items that are phone- 
mically similar to a familiar item will tend to ge represented by the familiar item 
node, and can take advantage of its long-term item-phoneme weights j. 
Presentation of a list leads to an increase in the long term component of the context- 
item association. Thus, if the same list is presented more than once its recall 
improves, and position specific intrusions from previous lists may also occur. Notice 
that only weights to or from an item winning at presentation or output are increased. 
3 Details 
There are n items per list, np phonemes per item, and 
seconds to present or recall. At time t, item node i has activation ai(t), context node 
i has activation ci(t), �t is the set of ne context nodes active at time t, phoneme 
node i has activation bi (t) and 7>i is the set of n phonemes comprising item i. 
Context nodes have activation 0 or x//2n,, phonemes take activation 0 or 1/vf, 
so Wi.(t) < x/-/2n, and w.(t) = ji(t) < 1/v/-, see (1) This sets the relative 
effect that context and phoneme layers hae on tems' actvatmn, and ensures that 
items of neither few nor many phonemes are favoured, see (Burgess & Hitch, 1992). 
The long-term components of phoneme-item weights w[(t) and %t.i(t ) are 0.45/v/  
for familiar items, and 0.15/v/'ff  for unfamiliar items (chosen to match the data 
in Fig. 3B). The long-term components of context-item weights Wi(t ) increase by 
0.15/vr, for each of the first few presentations or recalls of a list. 
Apart from the WTA interaction, each item node i has input: 
n(t) = E(t) + h(t) + m, (2) 
where Ii(t) < 0 is a decaying inhibition imposed following an item's selection at 
presentation or output (see below), r/ is a (0, a) Gaussian random variable added 
at output only, and Ei (t) is the excitatory input to the item from the phoneme layer 
during
