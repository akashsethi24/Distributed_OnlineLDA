ABSTRACT 
A new class of neural network aimed at early visual processing is 
described; we call it a Neural Analog Diffusion-Enhancement Layer or 
NADEL. The network consists of two levels which are coupled 
through feedfoward and shunted feedback connections. The lower level 
is a two-dimensional diffusion map which accepts visual features as 
input, and spreads activity over larger scales as a function of time. The 
upper layer is periodically fed the activity from the diffusion layer and 
locates local maxima in it (an extreme form of contrast enhancement) 
using a network of local comparators. These local maxima are fed back 
to the diffusion layer using an on-center/off-surround shunting 
anatomy. The maxima are also available as output of the network. The 
network dynamics serves to cluster features on multiple scales as a 
function of time, and can be used in a variety of early visual processing 
tasks such as: extraction of comers and high curvature points along 
edge contoms, line end detection, gap filling in contoms, generation of 
fixation points, perceptual grouping on multiple scales, correspondence 
and path impletion in long-range apparent motion, and building 2-D 
shape representations that are invariant to location, orientation, scale, 
and small deformation on the visual field. 
INTRODUCTION 
Computer vision is often divided into two main stages, early vision and late vision, 
which correspond to image processing and knowledge-based recognition/interpretation, 
respectively. Image processing for early vision involves algorithms for feature 
enhancement and extraction (e.g. edges and comers), featme grouping (i.e., perceptual

organization), and the extraction of physical properties for object surfaces that comprise a 
scene (e.g. reflectance, depth, surface slopes and curvatures, discontinuities). The 
computer vision literature is characterized by a plethora of algorithms to achieve many of 
these computations, though they are hardly robust in performance. 
Biological neural network processing does, of course, achieve all of these early vision 
tasks, as evidenced by psychological studies of the preattentive phase of human visual 
processing. Often, such studies provide motivation for new algorithms in computer 
vision. In contrast to this algorithmic approach, computational neural network processing 
tries to glean organizational and functional insights from the biological realizations, in 
order to emulate their information processing capabilities. This is desirable, mainly 
because of the adaptive and real-time nature of the neural network architecture. Here, we 
shall demonstrate that a single neural architecture based on dynamical diffusion- 
enhancement networks can realize a large variety of early vision tasks that deal mainly 
with perceptual grouping. The ability to group image features on multiple scales as a 
function of time, follows from attractive forces that emerge from the network 
dynamics. We have already implemented the NADEL (in 16-bit arithmetic) on a video- 
rate parallel computer, the PIPE [Kent et al., 1985], as well as a SUN-3 workstation. 
THE NADEL 
The Neural Analog Diffusion-Enhancement Layer was recenfiy introduced by Seibert & 
Waxman [1989], and is illustrated in Figure 1; it consists primarily of two levels which 
are coupled via feedforward and shunted feedback connections. Low-level features 
extracted from the imagery provide input to the lower level (a 2-D map) which spreads 
input activity over larger scales as time progresses via diffusion, allowing for passive 
decay of activity. The diffused activity is periodically sampled and passed upward to a 
contrast-enhancing level (another 2-D map) which locates local maxima in the terrain of 
diffuse activity. However, this forward pathway is masked by receptive fields which pass 
only regions of activity with positive Gaussian curvature and negative mean curvature; 
that is these receptive fields play the role of inhibitory dendro-dendrific modulatory gates. 
This masking fascilitates the local maxima detection in the upper level. These local 
maxima detected by the upper level are fed back to the lower diffusion level using a 
shunting dynamics with on-center/off-surround anatomy (cf. [Grossberg, 1973] on the 
importance of shunting for automatic gain control, and the role of center/surround 
anatomies in competitive networks). The local maxima are also available as outputs of the 
network, and take on different interpretations as a function of the input. A number of 
examples of spario-temporal grouping will be illustrated in the next section. 
The primary result of diffusion-enhancement network dynamics is to create a long- 
range attractive force between isolated featural inputs. This force manifests itself by 
shifting the local maxima of activity toward one another, leading to a featural grouping 
over multiple scales as a function of time. This is shown in Figure 1, where two featural 
inputs spread their initial excitations over time. The individual activities superpose, with 
the tail of one gaussian crossing the maximum of the other gaussian at an angle. This 
Neural Analog Diffusion-Enhancement Layer 291 
biases the superposition of activities, adding more activity to one side of a maximum than 
another, causing a shift in the local maxima toward one another. Eventually, the local 
maxima merge into a single maximum at the centroid of the individual inputs. If we keep 
track of the local maxima as diffusion progresses (by connecting the output of the 
enhancement layer to another layer which stores activity in short term memory), then the 
two initial inputs will become connected by a line. In Figure 1 we also illustrate the 
grouping of five features in two clusters, a configuration possessing two spatial scales. 
After litfie diffusion the local maxima are located where the initial inputs were. Further 
diffusion causes each cluster to form a single local maximum at the cluster centroid. 
Eventually, both clusters merge into a single hump of activity with one maximum at the 
centroid of the five initial inputs. Thus, multiscale grouping over time emerges. The 
examples of Figure 1 use only diffusion without any feedback, yet they illustrate the 
importance of localizing the local maxima through a kind of contrast-enhancement on 
another layer. The local maxima of activity serve as place tokens representing grouped 
features at a particular scale. The feedback pathway re-activates the diffusion layer, 
thereby allowing the grouping process to proceed to still larger scales, even across 
featureless areas of imagery. 
The dynamical evolution of activity in the NADEL can be modeled using a modified 
diffusion equation [Seibert & Waxman, 1989]. However, in our simulations of the 
NADEL we don't actually solve this differential equation direcfiy. Instead, each iteration 
of the NADEL consists of a spreading of activity using gaussian convolution, allowing 
for passive decay, then sampling the diffusion layer, masking out areas which are not 
positive Gaussian curvature and negative mean curvature activity surfaces, detecting one 
local maximum in each of these convex areas, and feeding this back to the diffusion layer 
with a shunted on-center/off-surround excitation at the local maxima. In the biological 
system, diffusion can be accomplished via a recurrent network of cells with off- 
center/on-surround lateral connectivity, or more direcfiy using electrotonic coupling 
across gap junctions as in the horizontal cell layer of the retina [Dowling, 1987]. 
Curvature masking of the activity surface can be accomplished using oriented off- 
center/on-surround receptive fields that modulate the connections between the two 
primary layers of the NADEL. 
SPATIO-TEMPORAL GROUPING 
We give several examples of grouping phenomena in early vision, utilizing the NADEL. 
In all cases its parameters correspond to gaussian spreading with c=3 and passive decay 
of 1% per iteration, and on-center/off-surround feedback with c+=1/12 and cL=l. 
Grouping of Two Points: The simple case of two instantaneous point stimuli input 
simultaneously to the NADEL is summarized in Figure 2. We plot the time (N network 
iterations) it takes to merge the two inputs, as a function of their initial separation (S 
pixels). For S<6 the points merge in one iteration; for S>24 activity equilibrates and 
shifting of local maxima never begins.

Grouping on Multiple Scales: Figure 3 illustrates the hierarchy of groupings generated 
by a square outline (31 pixels on a side) with gaps (9 pixels wide). Corner and line-end 
features are first enhanced using complementary center-surround receptive fields 
(modeled as a rectified response to a difference-of-gaussians), and located at the local 
maxima of activity. These features are shown superimposed on the shape in 3a; they 
serve as input to the NADEL. Figure 3b shows the loci of local maxima determined up to 
the second stable grouping, superimposed over the shape. Boundary completion fills the 
gaps in the square. In Figure 3c we show the loci of local maxima on the image plane, 
after the final grouping has occured (N=100 iterations). The trajectory of local maxima 
through space-time (x,y,t) is shown in Figure 3d after the fourth grouping. It reveals a 
hierarchical organization simil
