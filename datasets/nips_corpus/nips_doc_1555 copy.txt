Abstract 
We present a new energy-minimization framework for the graph 
isomorphism problem which is based on an equivalent maximum 
clique formulation. The approach is centered around a fundamental 
result proved by Motzkin and Straus in the mid-1960s, and recently 
expanded in various ways, which allows us to formulate the maxi- 
mum clique problem in terms of a standard quadratic program. To 
solve the program we use replicator equations, a class of simple 
continuous- and discrete-time dynamical systems developed in var- 
ious branches of theoretical biology. We show how, despite their 
inability to escape from local solutions, they nevertheless provide 
experimental results which are competitive with those obtained us- 
ing more elaborate mean-field annealing heuristics. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
The graph isomorphism problem is one of those few combinatorial optimization 
problems which still resist any computational complexity characterization [6]. De- 
spite decades of active research, no polynomial-time algorithm for it has yet been 
found. At the same time, while clearly belonging to NP, no proof has been pro- 
vided that it is NP-complete. Indeed, there is strong evidence that this cannot be 
the case for, otherwise, the polynomial hierarchy would collapse [5]. The current 
belief is that the problem lies strictly between the P and NP-complete classes. 
Because of its theoretical as well as practical importance, the problem has attracted 
much attention in the neural network community, and various powerful heuris- 
tics have been developed [11, 18, 19, 20]. Following Hopfield and Tank's seminal 
work [10], the typical approach has been to write down a (continuous) energy func- 
tion whose minimizers correspond to the (discrete) solutions being sought, and then 
construct a dynamical system which converges toward them. Almost invariably, all 
the algorithms developed so far are based on techniques borrowed from statistical 
mechanics, in particular mean field theory, which allow one to escape from poor 
Replicator Equations, Maximal Cliques, and Graph Isomorphism 551 
local solutions. 
In this paper, we develop a new energy-minimization framework for the graph iso- 
morphism problem which is based on the idea of reducing it to the maximum clique 
problem, another well-known combinatorial optimization problem. Central to our 
approach is a powerful result originally proved by Motzkin and Straus [13], and 
recently extended in various ways [3, 7, 16], which allows us to formulate the maxi- 
mum clique problem in terms of an indefinite quadratic program. We then present 
a class of straightforward continuous- and discrete-time dynamical systems known 
in mathematical biology as replicatot equations, and show how, thanks to their 
dynamical properties, they naturally suggest themselves as a useful heuristic for 
solving the proposed graph isomorphism program. The extensive experimental re- 
suits presented show that, despite their simplicity and their inherent inability to 
escape from local optima, replicator dynamics are nevertheless competitive with 
more sophisticated deterministic annealing algorithms. The proposed formulation 
seems therefore a promising framework within which powerful continuous-based 
graph matching heuristics can be developed, and is in fact being employed for solv- 
ing practical computer vision problems [17]. More details on the work presented 
here can be found in [15].

A QUADRATIC PROGRAM FOR GRAPH 
ISOMORPHISM 
2.1 GRAPH ISOMORPHISM AS CLIQUE SEARCH 
Let G - (V, E) be an undircctcd graph, where V is the set of vertices and E C_ V x V 
is the set of edges. The order of C is the number of its vertices, and its size is the 
number of edges. Two vertices i,j � V are said to be adjacent if (i,j) � E. The 
adjacency matrix of G is the n x n symmetric matrix A = (aij) defined as follows: 
aij -- 1 if (i, j) � E, aij ---- 0 otherwise. 
Given two graphs G' = (V',E') and G = (V,E) having the same order and 
size, an isomorphism between them is any bijection 0 ' V' -+ V such that 
(i,j) � E' <0 (O(i),O(j)) � E, for all i,j � V'. Two graphs are said to be 
isomorphic if there exists an isomorphism between them. The graph isomorphism 
problem is therefore to decide whether two graphs are isomorphic and, in the af- 
firmative, to find an isomorphism. Barrow and Burstall [1] introduced the notion 
of an association graph as a useful auxiliary graph structure for solving general 
graph/subgraph isomorphism problems. The association graph derived from G' 
and G is the undirected graph G = (V, E), where V = V' x V and 
E= {((i,h),(j,k)) � V x V � i  j, h  k, and(i,j) � E' <O (h,k) � E} 
Given an arbitrary undirected graph G = (V, E), a subset of vertices C is called a 
clique if all its vertices are mutually adjacent, i.e., for all i,j � C we have (i,j) � E. 
A clique is said to be maximal if it is not contained in any larger clique, and 
maximum if it is the largest clique in the graph. The clique number, denoted by 
w(G), is defined as the cardinality of the maximum clique. 
The following result establishes an equivalence between the graph isomorphism 
problem and the maximum clique problem (see [15] for proof). 
Theorem 2.1 Let G' and G be two graphs of order n, and let G be the correspond- 
ing association graph. Then, G' and G are isomorphic if and only if w(G) - n. In 
this case, any maximum clique of G induces an isomorphism between G' and G, 
and vice versa.

2.2 CONTINUOUS FORMULATION OF MAX-CLIQUE 
Let G - (V, E) be an arbitrary undircctcd graph of order n, and let $n denote the 
standard simplex of IR n' 
Given a subset of vertices C of G, we will denote by x c its characteristic vector 
which is the point in Sn defined as x? - 1/[CI if i c C, x? - 0 otherwise, where 
denotes the cardinality of C. 
Now, consider the following quadratic function: 
f(x) = xTAx (1) 
where T denotes transposition. The Motzkin-Straus theorem [13] establishes 
remarkable connection between global (local) maximizers of f in $, and maximum 
(maximal) cliques of G. Specifically, it states that a subset of vertices C of 
graph G is a maximum clique if and only if its characteristic vector x c is a global 
maximizer of the function f in $n. A similiar relationship holds between (strict) 
local maximizers and maximal cliques [7, 16]. 
One drawback associated with the original Motzkin-Straus formulation relates to 
the existence of spurious solutions, i.e., maximizers of f which are not in the form 
of characteristic vectors [16]. In principle, spurious solutions represent a problem 
since, while providing information about the order of the maximum clique, do not 
allow us to extract the vertices comprising the clique. Fortunately, there is straight- 
forward solution to this problem which has recently been introduced and studied 
by Bomze [3]. Consider the following regularized version of function f: 
1 
](x) = x tax + xrx. (2) 
The following is the spurious-free counterpart of the original Motzkin-Straus theo- 
rem (see [3] for proof). 
Theorem 2.2 Let C be a subset of vertices of a graph G, and let x c be its charac- 
teristic vector. Then the following statements hold: 
(a) C is a maximum clique of G if and only if x c is a global maximizer of ] over 
the simplex Sn. Its order is then given by IC I = 1/2(1 - f(xC)). 
(b) C is a maximal clique of G if and only if x c is a local maximizer of ] in S. 
(c) All local (and hence global) maximizers of f over Sn are strict. 
Unlike the Motzkin-Straus formulation, the previous result guarantees that all max- 
imizers of ] on Sn are strict, and are characteristic vectors of maximal/maximum 
cliques in the graph. In an exact sense, therefore, a one-to-one correspondence ex- 
ists between maximal cliques and local maximizers of ] in Sn on the one hand, and 
maximum cliques and global maximizers on the other hand. 
2.3 A QUADRATIC PROGRAM FOR GRAPH ISOMORPHISM 
Let G' and G be two arbitrary graphs of order n, and let A denote the adjaccncy 
matrix of the corresponding association graph, whose order is assumed to be N. 
The graph isomorphism problem is equivalent to the following program: 
1 
maximize f(x) = xT(A + IN)X 
subject to x C Sv (3) 
Replicator Equations, Maximal Cliques, and Graph Isomorphism 553 
More precisely, the following result holds, which is a straightforward consequence 
of Theorems 2.1 and 2.2. 
Theorem 2.3 Let G  and G be two graphs of order n, and let x* be a global 
solution of program (3), where A is the adjacency matrix of the association graph 
of G' and G. Then, G' and G are isomorphic if and only if f(x*) = 1 - 1/2n. 
In this case, any global solution to (3) induces an isomorphism between G  and 
and vice versa. 
In [15] we discuss the analogies between our objective function and those proposed 
in the literature (e.g., [18, 19]).

REPLICATOR EQUATIONS AND GRAPH 
ISOMORPHISM 
Let W be a non-negative n x n matrix, and consider the following dynamical system: 
dt ' 
j=l 
where ri(t) n .. 
= Y',j= wijxj(t), i -- 1. n, and its discrete-time counterpart: 
xi(t)ri(t) i= 1...n. (5) 
xi(t q- 1) = Ejn= 1 xj(t)r(t) ' 
It is readily seen that the simplex $n is invariant under these dynamics, which 
means that every trajectory starting in $n will remain in $n for all future times. 
Both (4) and (5) are called replicatot equations in theoretical biology, since they 
are used to model evolution over time of relative frequencies of interacting, self- 
replicating entities [9]. The discrete-time dynamical equations turn also out to be 
a special case of a general class of dynamical systems introduced by Baum and 
Eagon [2] in the context of Markov chain theory.
