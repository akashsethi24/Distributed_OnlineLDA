ABSTRACT 
The development of projections from the retinas to the cortex is 
mathematically analyzed according to the previously proposed 
thermodynamic formulation of the self-organization of neural networks. 
Three types of submodality included in the visual afferent pathways are 
assumed in two models: model (A), in which the ocularity and retinotopy 
are considered separately, and model (B), in which on-center/off-center 
pathways are considered in addition to ocularity and retinotopy. Model (A) 
shows striped ocular dominance spatial patterns and, in ocular dominance 
histograms, reveals a dip in the binocular bin. Model (B) displays 
spatially modulated irregular patterns and shows single-peak behavior in 
the histograms. When we compare the simulated results with the observed 
results, it is evident that the ocular dominance spatial patterns and 
histograms for models (A) and (B) agree very closely with those seen in 
monkeys and cats. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
A recent experimental study has revealed that spatial patterns of ocular dominance columns 
(ODCs) observed by autoradiography and profiles of the ocular dominance histogram 
(ODH) obtained by electrophysiological experiments differ greatly between monkeys and 
cats. ODCs for cats in the tangential section appear as beaded patterns with an irregularly 
fluctuating bandwidth (Anderson, Olavarria and Van Sluyters 1988); ODCs for monkeys are 
likely to be straight parallel stripes (Hubel, Wiesel and LeVay, 1977). The typical ODH for 
cats has a single peak in the middle of the ocular dominance corresponding to balanced 
response in ocularity (Wiesel and Hubel, 1974). In contrast to this, the ODH for monkeys 
has a dip in the middle of the ocular dominance (Hubel and Wiesel, 1963). Furthermore, 
neurons in the input layer of the cat's primary visual cortex exhibit orientation selectivity, 
while those of the monkey do not. 
Through these comparisons, we can observe distinct differences in the anatomical and 
physiological properties of neural projections from the retinas to the visual cortex in 
monkeys and cats. To obtain a better understanding of these differences, theoretical analyses 
of interactions among ocularity, retinotopy and on-center/off-center pathways during visual

cortical development were performed with computer simulation based on the previously 
proposed thermodynamic formulation of the self-organization of neural networks (Tanaka, 
1990). 
Two models for the development of the visual afferent pathways are assumed: model (A), in 
which the development of ocular dominance and retinotopic order is taken into account, and 
model (B), in which the development of on-center/off-center pathway terminals is 
considered in addition to ocular dominance and retinotopic order. 
2 MODEL DESCRIPTION 
The synaptic connection density of afferent fibers from the lateral geniculate nucleus CLGN) 
in a local equilibrium state is represented by the Potts spin variables o3,,,'s because of their 
strong winner-take-all process (Tanaka, 1990). The following function ({ 03..,}) gives the 
distribution of the Potts spins in equilibrium: 
zre,( {,,,u})= lexp(-H({&tt}) ) (1) 
Z T 
with Z =  exp( H({ ,,,tt}) ) (2) 
{q.,.=.o} T 
The Hamiltonian H in the argument of the exponential function in (1) and (2) determines 
the behavior of this spin system at the effective temperature T, where H is given by 
-=-Y_,Y_, Y_, v*? ' ,-,. � � o) 
Function v.V. c. represents the interaction between synapses at positions j and j' in layer 4 
of the primary visual cortex; function F.'.; represents the correlation in activity between 
LGN neurons at positions k and k' of cell types/.t and/.t'. The set B i represents a group 
of LGN neurons which can project their axons to the position j in the visual cortex; 
therefore, the magnitude of this set is related to the extent of afferent terminal arborization 
in the cortex ^. 
Taking the above formulation into consideration, we have only to discuss the 
thermodynamics in the Potts spin system described by the HamiltonJan H at the 
temperature T in order to discuss the activity-dependent self-organization of afferent neural 
connections during development. 
Next, let us discuss more specific descriptions on the modeling of the visual afferent 
pathways. We will assume that the LGN serves only as a relay nucleus and that the signal 
is transferred from the retina to the cortex as if they were directly connected. Therefore, the 
LGN R 
correlation function F.'.; can be treated as that in the retinas F.;.;. This function is 
V, R , 
given by using the lateral interaction function in the retina : and the correlation function 
20 Tanaka 
of stimuli to RGCs G ,;n,' in the following: 
kl,k2 
For simplicity, the stimuli are treated as white noise: 
Now, we can obtain two models for the formation of afferent synapfic connections between 
the retinas and the primary visual cortex: model (A), in which ocularity and retinotopy are 
taken into account: 
/{left, right}, K=[ 1 r] 
rl 1 
where r (0 g r g 1 ) is the correlation of activity between the left and right retinas; and 
model (B), in which on-center and off-center pathways are added to model (A): 
{(left, on-center), (left, off-center), (fight, on-center), (fight, off-center)} , 
1 F1 +/'2 F1 F1 
r +r2 1 r r 
K= 
r r 1 n 
r r n +r2 1 
where r2 (- 1 g r2 g 1 ) is the correlation of activity between the on-center and off-center 
RGCs in the same retina when there is no correlation between different retinas. A negative 
value of r2 means out-of-phase firings between on-center and off-center neurons. 
3 COMPUTER SIMULATION 
Computer simulations were carried out according to the Metropolis algorithm (Metropolis, 
1953; Tanaka, 1991). A square panel consisting of 80x80 grids was assumed to be the 
input layer of the primary visual cortex, where the length of one grid is denoted by a. The 
Potts spin is assigned to each grid. Free boundary conditions were adopted on the border of 
the panel. One square panel of 20><20 grids was assumed to be a retina for each submorality 
/z. The length of one grid is given as 4a so that the edges for the square model cortex and 
model retinas are of the same length. 
The following form was adopted for the interactions V[;; 's (v= VC or R ):

All results reported in this paper were obtained with parameters whose values are a.s 
follows: qVC = 1.0, qVC/, = 5.0, 3.vc = 0.15, 3.vc/,, = 1.0, qR, = l, 3.Ra = 0.5, 
;Rm = 1.0, ;^ = 1.6, a = 0.1, T = 0.001, rl = 0, and r2 = - 0.2. It is assumed that qR, = 0 
for model (A) while qRm = 0.5 for model (B). By considering that the receptive field (RF) 
of an RGC at position k is represented by #V; ;, RGCs for model (A) and (B) have low- 
pass and high-pass filtering properties, respectively. Monte Carlo simulation for model (A) 
was carried out for 200,000 steps; that for model (B) was done for 760,000 steps.

4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
The distributions of synaptic terminals and neurons, and ocular dominance histograms are 
shown in Fig. 1, where (a), Co) and (c) were obtained from model (A); (d), (e), (0 and (g) 
were obtained from model (B). The spatial distribution of synaptic terminals originating 
from the left or fight retina (Figs. la and ld) is a counterpart of an autoradiograph of the 
ODC by the eye-injection of radiolabeled amino acid. The bandwidth of the simulated ODC 
(Fig. la) is almost constant as well as the observed bandwidth for monkeys (Hubel and 
Wiesel, 1974). The distribution of ocularity in synaptic terminals shown in Fig. ld is 
irregular in that the periodicity seen in Fig. la disappears even though a patchy pattern can 
be seen. This pattern is quite similar to the ODC for cats (Anderson, Olavarria and Van 
Sluyters 1988). 
By calculating the convolution of the synaptic connections oi..,'s with the cortical 
interaction function V vc, 
i.i ' the ocular dominance in response of cortical cells to monocular 
stimulation and the spatial pattern of the ocular dominance in activity (Figs. lb and le) 
were obtained. Neurons specifically responding to stimuli presented in the right and left 
eyes are, respectively, in the black and white domains. This pattern is a counterpart of an 
electrophysiological pattern of the ODC. The distributions of ocularity in synaptic 
terminals correspond to those of ocular dominance in neuronal response to monocular 
stimulation (a to b; d to e in Fig. 1). This suggests that the borders of the autoradiographic 
ODC pattern coincide with those of the electrophysiological ODC pattern. This 
correspondence is not trivial since strong lateral inhibition exerts in the cortex. 
Reflecting the narrow transition areas between monocular domains in Fig. lb, a dip appears 
in the binocular bin in the corresponding ODH (Fig. lc). In contrast, the profile of the 
ODH (Fig. 113 has a single peak in the binocular bin since binocularly responsive neurons 
are distributed over the cortex (Fig. le). 
In model (B), on-center and off-center terminals are also segregated in the cortex in 
superposition to the ODC pattern (Fig. lg). No correlation can be seen between the spatial 
distribution of on-center/off-center terminals and the ODC pattern (Fig. ld).
