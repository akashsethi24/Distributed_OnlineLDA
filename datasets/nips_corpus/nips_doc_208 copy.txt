ABSTRACT 
Selective sampling is a form of directed search that can greatly 
increase the ability of a connectionist network to generalize accu- 
rately. Based on information from previous batches of samples, a 
network may be trained on data selectively sampled from regions 
in the domain that are unknown. This is realizable in cases when 
the distribution is known, or when the cost of drawing points from 
the target distribution is negligible compared to the cost of label- 
ing them with the proper classification. The approach is justified 
by its applicability to the problem of training a network for power 
system security analysis. The benefits of selective sampling are 
studied analytically, and the results are confirmed experimentally. 
I Introduction: Random Sampling vs. Directed Search 
A great deal of attention has been applied to the problem of generalization based 
on random samples drawn from a distribution, frequently referred to as learning 
from examples. Many natural learning learning systems however, do not simply 
rely on this passive learning technique, but instead make use of at least some form 
of directed search to actively examine the problem domain. In many problems, 
directed search is provably more powerful than passively learning from randomly 
given examples.

Typically, directed search consists of membership queries, where the learner asks for 
the classification of specific points in the domain. Directed search via membership 
queries may proceed simply by examining the information already given and deter- 
mining a region of uncertainty, the area in the domain where the learner believes 
mis-classification is still possible. The learner then asks for examples exclusively 
from that region. 
This paper discusses one form of directed search: selective sampling. In Section 2, 
we describe theoretical foundations of directed search and give a formal definition 
of selective sampling. In Section 3 we describe a neural network implementation 
of this technique, and we discuss the resulting improvements in generalization on a 
number of tasks in Section 4. 
2 Learning and Selective Sampling 
For some arbitrary domain learning theory defines a concept as being some subset of 
points in the domain. For example, if our domain is 2, we might define a concept 
as being all points inside a region bounded by some particular rectangle. 
A concept class is simply the set of concepts in some description language. 
A concept class of particular interest for this paper is that defined by neural network 
architectures with a single output node. Architecture refers to the number and types 
of units in a network and their connectivity. The configuration of a network specifies 
the weights on the connections and the thresholds of the units x 
A single-output architecture plus configuration can be seen as a specification of 
a concept classifier in that it classtries the set of all points producing a network 
output above some threshold value. Similarly, an architecture may be seen as a 
specification of a concept class. It consists of all concepts classified by configurations 
of the network that the learning rule can produce (figure 1).

2.1 Generalization and formal learning theory 
An instance, or training example, is a pair (z,f(z)) consisting of a point z in 
the domain, usually drawn from some distribution 7 >, along with its classification 
1 For the purposes of this discussion, a neural network will be considered to be a feedforward 
network of neuron-like components that compute a weighted sum of their inputs and modify 
that sum with a sigrnoidal transfer function. The methods described, however should be equally 
applicable to other, more general classifiers as well.

according to some target concept f. A concept c is consistent with an instance 
(z, f(z)) if c(z) = f(z), that is, if the concept produces the same classification of 
point z as the target. The error(c, f, 79) of a concept c, with respect to a target 
concept f and a distribution 79, is the probability that c and f will disagree on a 
random sample drawn from 79. 
The generalization problem, is posed by formal learning theory as: for a given 
concept class C, an unknown target f, and an arbitrary error rate e, how many 
samples do we have to draw from an arbitrary distribution 7 ) in order to find a 
concept c  C such that error(c, f, 7 )) _ e with high confidence? This problem 
has been studied for neural networks in (Baum and I-Iaussler, 1989) and (I-Iaussler, 
2.2 7(S), the region of uncertainty 
If we consider a concept class C and a set S  of rn instances, the classification of 
some regions of the domain may be implicitly determined; all concepts in C that 
are consistent with all of the instances may agree in these parts. What we are 
interested in here is what we define to be the region of uncertainty: 
7($ ') = {x '3c,c2 e C, cx,c2 are consistent with all s e $, and cx(x)  c(x)). 
For an arbitrary distribution 7 9, we can define a measure on the size of this region as 
a = Pr[x e R(S)]. In an incremental learning procedure, as we classify and train 
on more points, a will be monotonically non-increasing. A point that falls outside 
R(S m) will leave it unchanged; a point inside will further restrict the region. Thus, 
a is the probability that a new, random point from 7 ) will reduce our uncertainty. 
A key point is that since R(S ) serves as an envelope for consistent concepts, it 
also bounds the potential error of any consistent hypothesis we choose. If the error 
of our current hypothesis is �, then � _ . Since we have no basis for changing 
our current hypothesis without a contradicting point, e is also the probability of an 
additional point reducing our error. 
2.3 Selective sampling is a directed search 
Consider the case when the cost of drawing a point from our distribution is small 
compared to the cost of finding the point's proper classification. Then, after training 
on n instances, if we have some inexpensive method of testing for membership in 
7(S), we can filter points drawn from our distribution, selecting, classifying and 
training on only those that show promise of improving our representation. 
Mathematically, we can approximate this filtering by defining a new distribution 79 
that is zero outside 7(S), but maintains the relative distribution of 79. Since the 
next sample from 79 would be guaranteed to land inside the region, it would have, 
with high confidence, the effect of at least 1/a samples drawn from 79. 
The filtering process can be applied iteratively. Start out with the distribution 
790, = 79. Inductively, train on n samples chosen from 79i, to obtain a new region

of uncertainty, R(Si,'), and define from it Pi+t, = P'i,. The total number of 
training points to calculate 7>i,n is rn = in. 
Selective sampling can be contrasted with random sampling in terms of efficiency. 
In random sampling, we can view training as a single, non-selective pass where 
n = rn. As the region of uncertainty shrinks, so does the probability that any given 
additional sample will help. The efficiency of the samples decreases with the error. 
By filtering out useless samples before committing resources to them, as we can do 
in selective sampling, the efficiency of the samples we do classify remains high. In 
the limit where n = 1, this regimen has the effect of querying: each sample is taken 
from a region based on the cumulative information from all previous samples, and 
each one will reduce the size of 7(S). 
3 Training Networks with Selective Sampling 
A leading concern in connectionist research is how to achieve good generalization 
with a limited number of samples. This suggests that selective sampling, properly 
implemented, should be a useful tool for training neural networks. 
3.1 A nKive neural network querying algorithm 
Since neural networks with real-valued outputs are generally trained to within some 
tolerance (say, less than 0.1 for a zero and greater than 0.9 for a one), one is tempted 
to use the part of the domain between these limits as T(S ) (figure 2). 
Figure 2: The region of uncertainty captured by a nai've neural network 
The problem with applying this naive approach to neural networks is that when 
training, a network tends to become overly confident in regions that are still 
unknown. The T(S ) chosen by this method will in general be a very small subset 
of the true region of uncertainty. 
3.2 Version-space search and neural networks 
Mitchell (1978) describes a learning procedure based on the partial-ordering in 
generality of the concepts being learned. One maintains two sets of plausible hy- 
potheses: S and G. S contains all most specific concepts consistent with present 
information, and G contains all consistent most general concepts. The version 
space, which is the set of all plausible concepts in the class being considered, lies 
570 Atlas, Cohn and Ladner 
between these two bounding sets. Directed search proceeds by examining instances 
that fall in the difference of S and G. Specifically, the search region for a version- 
space search is equal to {UsAg : s  $,g  G}. If an instance in this region 
proves positive, then some s in $ will have to generalize to accommodate the new 
information; if it proves negative, some g in G will have to be modified to exclude 
it. In eit
