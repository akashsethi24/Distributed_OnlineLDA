Abstract 
Accounts of neurological disorders often posit damage to a specific 
functional pathway of the brain. Farah (1990) has proposed an alterna- 
tive class of explanations involving partial damage to multiple path- 
ways. We explore this explanation for optic aphasia, a disorder in which 
severe performance deficits are observed when patients are asked to 
name visually presented objects, but surprisingly, performance is rela- 
tively normal on naming objects from auditory cues and on gesturing 
the appropriate use of visually presented objects. We model this highly 
specific deficit through partial damage to two pathways--one that maps 
visual input to semantics, and the other that maps semantics to naming 
responses. The effect of this damage is superadditive, meaning that 
tasks which require one pathway or the other show little or no perfor- 
mance deficit, but the damage is manifested when a task requires both 
pathways (i.e., naming visually presented objects). Our model explains 
other phenomena associated with optic aphasia, and makes testable 
experimental predictions. 
Neuropsychology is the study of disrupted cognition resulting from damage to functional 
systems in the brain. Generally, accounts of neuropsychological disorders posit damage to 
a particular functional system or a disconnection between systems. Farah (1990) sug- 
gested an alternative class of explanations for neuropsychological disorders: partial dam- 
age to multiple systems, which is manifested through interactions among the loci of 
damage. We explore this explanation for the neuropsychological disorder of optic aphasia. 
Optic aphasia, arising from unilateral left posterior lesions, including occipital cortex 
and the splenium of the corpus callosum (Schnider, Benson, & Scharre, 1994), is marked 
by a deficit in naming visually presented objects, hereafter referred to as visual naming 
(Farah, 1990). However, patients can demonstrate recognition of visually presented 
objects nonverbally, for example, by gesturing the appropriate use of an object or sorting 
visual items into their proper superordinate categories (hereafter, visual gesturing). 
Patients can also name objects by nonvisual cues such as a verbal definition or typical 
sounds made by the objects (hereafter, auditory naming). The highly specific nature of the 
deficit rules out an explanation in terms of damage to a single pathway in a standard model 
of visual naming (Figure 1), suggesting that a more complex model is required, involving

aphasia cannot be explained by damage to 
the vision-to-semantics pathway or the 
semantics-to-naming pathway, Farah 
(1990) proposed an explanation in terms of 
partial damage to both pathways (the X's).

multiple semantic systems or multiple pathways to visual naming. However, a more parsi- 
monious account is suggested by Farah (1990): Optic aphasia might arise from partial 
lesions to two pathways in the standard model--those connecting visual input to seman- 
tics, and semantics to naming--and the effect of damage to these pathways is superaddi- 
tive, meaning that tasks which require only one of these pathways (e.g., visual gesturing, 
or auditory naming) will be relatively unimpaired, whereas tasks requiring both pathways 
(e.g., visual naming) will show a significant deficit. 
1 A MODEL OF SUPERADDITIVE IMPAIRMENTS 
We present a computational model of the superadditive-impairment theory of optic apha- 
sia by elaborating the architecture of Figure 1. The architecture has four pathways: visual 
input to semantics (V->S), auditory input to semantics (A->S), semantics to naming 
(S-->N), and semantics to gesturing (S-->G). Each pathway acts as an associative memory. 
The critical property of a pathway that is required to explain optic aphasia is a speed-accu- 
racy trade off: The initial output of a pathway appears rapidly, but it may be inaccurate. 
This quick and dirty guess is refined over time, and the pathway output asymptotically 
converges on the best interpretation of the input. 
We implement a pathway using the architecture suggested by Mathis and Mozer 
(1996). In this architecture, inputs are mapped to their best interpretations by means of a 
two-stage process (Figure 2). First, a quick, one-shot mapping is performed by a multi- 
layer feedforward connectionist network to transform the input directly to its correspond- 
ing output. This is followed by a slower iterative clean-up process carried out by a 
recurrent attractor network. This architecture shows a speed-accuracy trade off by virtue 
of the .assumption that the feedforward mapping network does not have the capacity to 
produce exactly the right output to every input, especially when the inputs are corrupted 
by noise or are otherwise incomplete. Consequently, the clean up stage is required to pro- 
duce a sensible interpretation of the noisy output of the mapping network. 
Fully distributed attractor networks have been used for similar purposes (e.g., Plaut 
& Shallice, 1993). For simplicity, we adopt a localist-attractor network with a layer of 
state units and a layer of radial basis function (RBF) units, one RBF unit per attractor. 
Each RBF or attractor unit measures the distance of the current state to the attractor that it 
represents. The activity of attractor unit i, a i, is:

where s(0 is the state unit activity vector at time t, gi is the vector denoting the location of 
attractor i, and 13 i is the strength of the attractor. The strength determines the region of the 
state space over which an attractor will exert its pull, and also the rate at which the state 
vill converge to the attractor. The state units receive input from the mapping network and 
from the attractor units and are updated as follows: 
si(t ) = di(t)ei(t ) + (1 -di(t))aj(t-1)gji (3)

where si(O is the activity of state unit i at time t, e i is the ith output of the mapping net,

weighted time average of the ith output of the mapping net,

In all simulations, ct = .02. 
The activity of the state units are governed by two forces--the external input from 
the feedforward net (first term in Equation 3) and the attractor unit activities (second 
term). The parameter di acts as a kind of attentional mechanism that modulates the relative 
influence of these two forces. The basic idea is that when the input coming from the map- 
ping net is changing, the system should be responsive to the input and should not yet be 
concerned with interpreting the input. In this case, the input is copied straight through to 
the state units and hence di should have a value close to 1. When the input begins to stabi- 
lize, however, the focus shifts to interpreting the input and following the dynamics of the 
attractor network. This shift corresponds to d i being lowered to zero. The weighted time 
average in the update rule for di is what allows for the smooth transition of the function to 
its new value. For certain constructions of the function d, Zemel and Mozer (in prepara- 
tion) have proven convergence of the algorithm to an attractor. 
Apart from speed-accuracy trade off, these dynamics have another important conse- 
quence for the present model, particularly with respect to cascading pathways. If pathway 
^ feeds into pathway 13, such as V-->S feeding into S-oN, then the state unit activities of 
act as the input to 13. Because these activities change over time as the state approaches a 
well-formed state, the dynamics of pathway 13 can be quite complex as it is forced to deal 
with an unstable input. This property is important in explaining several phenomena associ- 
ated with optic aphasia. 
1.1 PATTERN GENERATION 
Patterns were constructed for each of the five representational spaces: visual and auditory 
input, semantic, name and gesture responses. Each representational space was arbitrarily 
made to be 200 dimensional. We generated 200 binary-valued (-1,+1) patterns in each 
space, which were meant to correspond to known entities of that representational domain. 
For the visual, auditory, and semantic spaces, patterns were partitioned into 50 simi- 
larity clusters with 4'siblings per cluster. Patterns were chosen randomly subject to two 
constraints: patterns in different clusters had to be at least 80 � apart, and siblings had to be 
between 25 � and 50 � apart. Because similarity of patterns in the name and gesture spaces 
was irrelevant to our modeling, we did not impose a similarity structure on these spaces.

Instead, we generated patterns in these spaces at random subject to the constraint that 
every pattern had to be at least 60 � from every other.
