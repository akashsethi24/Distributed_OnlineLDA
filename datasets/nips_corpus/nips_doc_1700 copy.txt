Abstract 
We have developed a VLSI silicon neuron and a corresponding mathe- 
matical model that is a two state-variable system. We describe the cir- 
cuit implementation and compare the behaviors observed in the silicon 
neuron and the mathematical model. We also perform bifurcation analy- 
sis of the mathematical model by varying the externally applied current 
and show that the behaviors exhibited by the silicon neuron under corre- 
sponding conditions are in good agreement to those predicted by the 
bifurcation analysis. 
1 Introduction 
The use of hardware models to understand dynamical behaviors in biological systems is 
an approach that has a long and fruitful history [1][2]. The implementation in silicon of 
oscillatory neural networks that model rhythmic motor-pattern generation in animals is 
one recent addition to these modeling efforts [3][4]. The oscillatory patterns generated by 
these systems result from intrinsic membrane properties of individual neurons and their 
synaptic interactions within the network [5]. As the complexity of these oscillatory sili- 
con systems increases, effective mathematical analysis becomes increasingly more impor- 
tant to our understanding their behavior. However, the nonlinear dynamical behaviors of 
the model neurons and the large-scale interconnectivity among these neurons makes it 
very difficult to analyze theoretically the behavior of the resulting very large-scale inte- 
grated (VLSI) systems. Thus, it is important to first identify methods for modeling the 
model neurons that underlie these oscillatory systems. 
Several simplified neuronal models have been used in the mathematical simulations of 
pattern generating networks [6][7][8]. In this paper, we describe the implementation of a 
732 G. N. Patel, G. S. Cymbalyuk, R. L. Calabrese and S. P. De Weerth 
two-state-variable silicon neuron that has been used effectively to develop oscillatory net- 
works [9][10]. We then derive a mathematical model of this implementation and analyze 
the neuron and the model using nonlinear dynamical techniques including bifurcation 
analysis [11 ]. Finally, we compare the experimental data derived from the silicon neuron 
to that obtained from the mathematical model. 
2 The silicon model neuron 
The schematic for our silicon model neuron is shown in Figure 1. This silicon neuron is 
inspired by the two-state, Morris-Lecar neuron model [12][13]. Transistor M1, analo- 
gous to the voltage-gated calcium channel in the Morris-Lecar model, provides an instan- 
taneous inward current that raises the membrane potential towards VHig h when the 
membrane is depolarized. Transistor M 2 , analogous to the voltage-gated potassium chan- 
nel in the Morris-Lecar model, provides a delayed outward current that lowers the mem- 
brane potential toward VLo w when the membrane is depolarized. V H and VL are 
analogous to the half-activation voltages for the inward and outward currents, respec- 
tively. The voltages across C 1 and C 2 are the state variables representing the membrane 
potential, V, and the slow activation variable of the outward current, W, respectively. 
The W-nullcline represents its steady-state activation curve. Unlike the Morris-Lecar 
model, our silicon neuron model does not possess a leak current. 
Using current conservation at node V, the net current charging C 1 is given by 
C 1 $2 = Iext0[ P + iH0[p -- iL0[N 
(1) 
where iH and i are the output currents of a differential pair circuit, and c% and c N 
describe the ohmic effects of transistors M 1 and M2, respectively. The net current into C 2 
is given by 
C 2W = iXPN (2) 
where i x is the output current of the OTA, and [3p and 13 N account for ohmic effects of 
the pull-up and the pull-down transistors inside the OTA.

Figure 1: Circuit diagram of the silicon neuron. The circuit incorporates analog building 
blocks including two differential pair circuits composed of a bias current, IBH, and 
transistors M4-M 5, and a bias current, IBL, and transistors M6-M 7, and a single follower- 
integrator circuit composed of an operational transconductance amplifier (OTA), X 1 in the 
configuration shown and a load capacitor, C 2. The response of the follower-integrator 
circuit is similar to a first-order low-pass filter.

The output currents of the differential-pair and an OTA circuits, derived by using sub- 
threshold transistor equations [2], are a Fermi function and a hyperbolic-tangent func- 
tion, respectively [2]. Substituting these functions for i a , i n , and i x in (1) and (2) yields

U T is the thermal voltage, Vdd is the supply voltage, and K is a fabrication dependent 
parameter. The terms (Zp and (Z N limit the range of V to within VHig h and VLo w, and the 
terms Op and ON limit the range of I/V to within the supply rails (Vdd and Gnd). 
In order to compare the model to the experimental results, we needed to determine val- 
ues for all of the model parameters. Vli_ h , VLo w , V H , V L , and Vdd were directly mea- 
sured in experiments. The parameters fia and IB L were measured by voltage-clamp 
experiments performed on the silicon neuron. At room temperature, U T = 0.025 volts. 
The value of K = 0.65 was estimated by measuring the slope of the steady-state activa- 
tion curve of inward current. Because W was implemented as an inaccessible node, I x 
could only be estimated. Based on the circuit design, we can assume that the bias cur- 
rents I x and IBH are of the same order of magnitude. We choose I T = 2.2 nA to fit the 
bifurcation diagram (see Figure 3). C1 and C2, which are assumed to be identical accord- 
ing to the physical design, are time scaling parameters in the model. We choose their val- 
ues (C1 = C2 = 28 pF) to fit frequency dependence on Iex t (see Figure 4). 
3 Bifurcation analysis 
The silicon neuron and the mathematical model 1 described by (3) demonstrate various 
dynamical behaviors under different parametric conditions. In particular, stable oscilla- 
tions and steady-state equilibria are observed for different values of the externally applied 
current, /ext' We focused our analysis on the influence of lext on the neuron behavior for 
two reasons: (i) it provides insight about effects of synaptic currents, and (ii) it allows 
comparison with neurophysiological experiments in which polarizing current is used as a 
primary control parameter. The main results of this work are presented as the comparison 
between the mathematical models and the experimental data represented as bifurcation 
diagrams and frequency dependencies. 
The nullclines described by (3) and for Iex t = 32 nA are shown in Figure 2A. In the 
regime that we operate the circuit, the W-nullcline is an almost-linear curve and the V- 
nullcline is an N-shaped curve. From (3), it can be seen that when IBu + Iex t > IB L the 
nullclines cross at (V, W)= (VHigh, VHigh) and the system has high voltage (about 5 
volts) steady-state equilibrium. Similarly, for Iex t close to zero, the system has one stable 
equilibrium point close to (V, W) = (VLo w, Vow). 
1The parameters used throughout the analyses of the model are VLo w = 0 V, 
VHig h = 5 V, V L = V H = 2.5 V, IB8 = 6.5 nA, /BL = 42 nA, I T = 2.2 nA, 
Vdd = 5 V, U t = 0.025 mY, and K = 0.65.

The system exhibits a stable limit-cycle (filled circles), an unstable limit-cycle (untilled 
circles), and stable equilibrium point. Unstable limit-cycle separates the basins of 
attraction of the stable limit-cycle and stable equilibrium point. Thus, trajectories initiated 
within the area bounded by the unstable limit-cycle approach the stable equilibrium point 
(solid line in A's inset, and x's in B). Trajectories initiated outside the unstable limit- 
cycle approach the stable limit-cycle. In A, the inset shows an expansion at the 
intersection of the V- and W-nullclines.
