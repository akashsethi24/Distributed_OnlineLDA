Abstract 
The occurence of chaos in recurrent neural networks is supposed to 
depend on the architecture and on the synaptic coupling strength. It is 
studied here for a randomly diluted architecture. By normalizing the 
variance of synaptic weights, we produce a bifurcation parameter, 
dependent on this variance and on the slope of the transfer function but 
independent of the connectivity, that allows a sustained activity and the 
occurence of chaos when reaching a critical value. Even for weak 
connectivity and small size, we find numerical results in accordance 
with the theoretical ones previously established for fully connected 
infinite sized networks. Moreover the route towards chaos is 
numerically checked to be a quasi-periodic one, whatever the type of the 
first bifurcation is (Hopf bifurcation, pitchfork or flip).

1 INTRODUCTION 
Most part of studies on recurrent neural networks assume sufficient conditions of 
convergence. Models with symmetric synaptic connections have dynamical properties 
strongly connected with those of spin-glasses. In particular, they have relaxationnal 
dynamics caracterised by the decreasing of a function which is analogous to the energy in 
spin-glasses (or free energy for models submitted to thermal noise). Networks with 
asymmetric synaptic connections lose this convergence property and can have more 
complex dynamics, but searchers try to obtain such a convergence because the relaxation 
to a stable network state is simply interpreted as a stored pattern. 
However, as pointed out by Hirsch (1989), it might be very interesting, from an 
engineering point of view, to investigate non convergent networks because their 
dynamical possibilities are much richer for a given number of units. Moreover, the real 
brain is a highly dynamic system. Recent neurophysiological findings have focused 
attention on the rich temporal structures (oscillations) of neuronal processes (Gray et al., 
1989), which might play an important role in information processing. Chaotic behavior 
has been found out in the nervous system (Gallez & Babloyantz, 1991) and might be 
implicated in cognitive processes (Skarda & Freeman, 1987). 
We have studied the emergent dynamics of a general class of non convergent networks. 
Some results are already available in this field. Sompolinsky et al. (1988) established 
strong theoretical results concerning the occurrence of chaos for fully connected networks 
in the thermodynamic limit (N ---, 0) by using the Dynamic Mean Field Theory. Their 
model is a continuous time, continuous state dynamical system with N fully connected 
neurons. Each connection Jij is a gaussian random variable with zero mean and a 
normalized variance J2/N. As the Jij's are independent, the constant term j2 can be seen 
as the variance of the sum of the weights connected to a given unit. Thus, the global 
strength of coupling remains constant for each neuron as N increases. The output 
function of each neuron is sigmoidal with a slope g. Sompolinsky et al. established that, 
in the limit N --, o% there is a sharp transition from a stationary state to a chaotic flow. 
The onset of chaos is given by the critical value gJ=l. For gJ<l the system admits the 
only fixed point zero, while for gJ >1 it is chaotic. The same authors performed 
simulations on finite and large values of N and showed the existence of an intermediate 
regime (nonzero stationary states or limit cycles) separating the stationary and the chaotic 
phase, but the routes to chaos were not systematically explored. The range of gJ where 
this intermediate behavior is observed shrinks as N increases. 
2 THE MODEL 
The hypothesis of a fully connected network being not biologically plausible, it could be 
interesting to inspect how far these restfits cotfid be extended as the dilution increases for 
a general class of networks. The model we study is defined as follows: the mmber of 
units is N, and K is the fixed number of connections received by one unit (K>I). There is 
no connection from one unit to itsdf. The K connections are randomly selected (with an 
uniform law) among the N- 1' s. The state of each neuron i at time t is characterized by its 
Destabilization and Route to Chaos in Neural Networks with Random Connectivity 551 
output x i (t) which is a real variable varying between - 1 and 1. The discrete and parallel 
dynamics is given by: 
x i (t+l) = tanh 
g Jij V (t)) 
J 
Jij is the synaptic weight which couples the output of unit j to the input of unit i. 
These weights are random independent variables chosen with a uniform law, with zero 
mean and a normalized variance J2/K. Notice that, with such a normalization, the 
standard deviation of the sum of the weights afferent to a given neuron is the constant J. 
One has to distinguish two effects of coupling on the behavior of such a class of models. 
The first effect is due to the strength of coupling, independent of the number of 
connections. The second one is due to the architecture of coupling, which can be studied 
by keeping constant the global synaptic effect of coupling. The genefidty of our model 
cancels the peculiar dynamic features which may occur due to geometrical effects. 
Moreover it allows to study a model at different scales of dilution. 
3 FIRST BIFURCATION 
For such a system, zero is always a fixed point and for low bifurcation parameter value it 
is the only fixed point and it is stable. Let us call Ama x the eigenvalue of the matrix of 
synaptic weights with the greatest modulus and p = I Xmaxl the spectral radius of this 
matrix. The loss of stability arises when the product gp is larger than 1. Our numerical 
simulations allow us to state that p is approximately equal to J for sufficiently large- 
sized networks. This statement can be derived rigorously for an approximate regularized 
model in the thermodynamic limit (Doyon et al., 1993).

We have studied by intensive simulations on a Cray I-XMP computer the statistical 
spectral distribution for N ranging from 4 to 512 and for K ranging from 2 to 32. Figure 
1 shows two examples of spectra (for convenience, Jis set to 1). The apparent drawing of 
a real axis is due to the real eigenvalue density but the distribution converges to a 
uniform one over the J radius disk, as N increases. A similar result has been theoretically 
552 Doyon, Cessac, Quoy, and Samuelides 
achieved for full gaussian matrices (Girko, 1985; Sommers et al., 1988). Thus pquickly 
decreases to J, so the loss of stability arises for a mean gJ value that increases to 1 for 
increasing size (Tab. 1). For a given N value, p is nearly independent of K.

Three types of first bifurcation can occur, depending on the eigenvalue g-max: 
a) HopfBifurcation: this corresponds to the appearance of oscillations. There are 
two complex conjugate eigenvalues with maximal modulus p. 
b) Pitchfork bifurcation: if max is real positive, the bifurcafion arises when 
gmax = 1. Zero loses its stability and two branches of stable eqtdlibfia emerge. 
c) Flip Bifurcation: for maxreal and negative a fiip bifurcation occurs when 
gmax =' 1. This corresponds to the appearance of a period two oscillation. 
As the network size increases, the proportion of Hopf bifurcations increas because the 
proportion of real Ama x decreases, nearly independent of K. 
4 Rou'rE TO CHAOS 
To study the following bifurcations, we chose the global observable: 
N 
1 
m(t) = xi (t) 
i=l 
.The value m(t) correctly characterizes all types of first bifurcation that can occur. Indeed 
the route to chaos is qualitatively well described by this observable, as we checked it by 
Destabilization and Route to Chaos in Neural Networks with Random Connectivity 553 
studying simultaneously x i (t). The onset-of chaos was computed by testing the 
sensitivity on initial conditions for m(O ï¿½ We observed the onset of chaos occurs for quite 
low parameter values. The transient zone from fixed point to chaos shrinks slowly to 
zero as the network size increases (Tab. 1). 
The qualitative study of the routes to chaos was made on a span of networks with various 
connectivity and quite important size. The route towards chaos that was observed was a 
quasi-periodic one in all cases with some variations due to the particular symmetry x -, 
- x. The following figures are obtained by plotting m(t+l) versus m(0 after discarding the 
transient (Fig. 2). They are not qualitatively different with a reconstruction in a higher 
dimensional space. The dominant features are the following ones.
