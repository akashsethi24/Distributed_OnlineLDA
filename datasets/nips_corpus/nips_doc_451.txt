ABSTRACT 
We consider a noisy bistable single neuron model driven by a periodic 
external modulation. The modulation introduces a correlated switching 
between states driven by the noise. The information flow through the sys- 
tem from the modulation to the output switching events, leads to a succes- 
sion of strong peaks in the power spectrum. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) 
obtained from this power spectrum is a measure of the information content 
in the neuron response. With increasing noise intensity, the SNR passes 
through a maximum, an effect which has been called stochastic resonance. 
We treat the problem within the framework of a recently developed approx- 
imate theory, valid in the limits of weak noise intensity, weak periodic forc- 
ing and low forcing frequency. A comparison of the results of this theory 
with those obt6ned from a linear system FFT is also presented. 
INTRODUCTION 
Recently, there has been an upsurge of interest in single or few-neuron nonlinear 
dynamics (see e.g. Li and Hopfield, 1989; Tuckwell, 1988; Paulus, Gass and Mandell, 1990; 
Aihara, Takake and Toyoda, 1990). However, the precise relationship between the many- 
neuron connected model and a single effective neuron dynamics has not been examined in 
detail. Schieve, Bulsara and Davis (1991) have considered a network of N symmetrically 
interconnected neurons embodied, for example in the 'connectlonist' models of Hopfield 
(1982, 1984) or Shamma (1989) (the latter corresponding to a mammalian auditory net- 
work). Through an adiabatic elimination procedure, they have obtained, in closed form, the 
dynamics of a single neuron from the system of coupled differential equations describing the 
N-neuron problem. The problem has been treated both deterministically and stochastically 
(through the inclusion of additive and multiplicative noise terms). It is important to point 
out that the work of Schieve, Bulsara, and Davis does not include a priori a self-coupling 
term, although the inclusion of such a term can be readily implemented in their theory; this 
has been done by Bulsara and Schieve (1991). Rather, their theory results in an explicit 
form of the self-coupling term, in terms of the parameters of the rem6ning neurons in the 
network. This term, in effect, renormalizes the self-coupling term in the Shamma and Hop- 
field models. The reduced or 'effective' neuron model is expected to reproduce some of the 
gross features of biological neurons. The fact that simple single neuron models, such as the 
model to be considered in this work, can indeed reproduce several features observed in bio- 
logical experiments has been strikingly demonstrated by Longtin, Bulsara and Moss (1991) 
through their construction of the inter-spike-interval histograms (ISIHs) using a Schmidt 
trigger to model the neuron. The results of their simple model agree remarkably well with 
data obtained in two different experiments (on the auditory nerve fiber of squirrel monkey 
(Rose, Brugge, Andersen and Hind, 1967) ad on the cat visual cortex (Siegal, 1990)). 
In this work, we consider such a 'reduced' neural element subject to a weak periodic 
external modulation. The modulation introduces a correlated switching between the 
67

bistable states, driven by the noise with the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) obtained from the 
power spectrum, being taken as a measure of the information content in the neuron 
response. As the aclditive noise variance increases, the SNR passes through a maximum. 
This effect has been called 'stochastic resonance' and describes a phenomenon in which the 
noise actually enhances the information content, i.e., the observability of the signal. Sto- 
chastic resonance has been observed in a modulated ring laser experiment (McNamara, 
Wiesenfeld and Roy, 1988; Vemuri and Roy, 1989) as well as in electron parsmagnetic reso- 
nance experiments (Gammaitoni, Martinelli, Pardi and Santucci, 1991) and in a modulated 
magnetoselastic ribbon (Spano and Ditto, 1991). The introduction of multiplicative noise 
(in the coefficient of the sigmoid transfer function) tends to degracle this effect. 
THE MODEL; STOCHASTIC RESONANCE 
The reduced neuron model consists of a single Hopfield-type computational element, 
which may be modeled as a R-C circuit with nonlinear feedback provided by an operational 
amplifier having a sigmoid transfer function. The equation (which may be rigorously 
derived from a fully connected network model as outlined in the preceding section) may be 
cast in the form, 
+ a x - b taxhx: s0 + F(t), (1) 
where F(t) is Gaussian delta-correlated noise with zero mean and variance 2D, z0 being a 
dc input (which we set equal to zero for the remainder of this work). An analysis of (1), 
including multiplicative noise effects, has been given by Bulsara, Boss and Jacobs (1989). 
For the purposes of the current work, we note that the neuron may be treated as a particle 
in a one-dimensional potential given by, 
u(x)= 2 b (2) 
x being the one-dimensional .tate variable representing the membrane potential. In gen- 
eral, the coefficients a and b depend on the details of the interaction of our reference neu- 
ron to the remaining neurons in the network (Schieve, Bulsara and Davis, 1990). The 
potential described by (2) is bimodal for n) 1 with the extrema occurring at (we set 
throughout the remainder of this work),

the approximation holding for large b. Note that the N-shaped characteristic inherent in 
the firing dynamics derived from the Hodgkin-Huxley equations (Rinzel and Ermentrout, 
1990) is markedly similar to the plot of dU/dz vs. z for the simple bistable system (1). 
For a stationary potential, and for D << U0 where U0 is the depth of the deterministic 
potential, the probability that a switching event will occur in unit time, i.e. the switching 
rate, is given by the Kramers frequency (Kramers, 1940), 
0

which, for small noise, may be cast in the form (the local equilibrium assumption of Kra- 
mers), 
where Ulal(z} = daU/dz a 
We now include a periodic modulation term esinwt on the right-hand-side of {1) (note 
that for e<2(b-1)/(3b) one does not observe switching in the noise-free system). This 
leads to a modulation (i.e. rocking) of the potential (2) with time: an aclditional term 
-zesinwt is now present on the right-hand-side of (2). In this case, the Kramers rate (4) 
becomes time-dependent: 
which is accurate only for  << U0 and co << {Ulal(�)}/a. The latter condition is referred to 
as the adiabatic approzimation. It ensures that the probability density corresponding to 
Single Neuron Model: Response to Weak Modulation in the Presence of Noise 69 
the time-modulated potential is approximately stationary (the modulation is slow enough 
that the instantaneous probability density can 'adiabatically' relax to a succession of 
quasi-stationary states). 
We now follow the work of McNamara and Wiesenfeld (1989), developing a two-state 
model by introducing a probability of finding the system in the left or right well of the 
potential. A rate equation is constructed based on the Kramers rate r(t) given by (5). 
Within the framework of the adiabatic approximation, this rate equation may be integrated 
to yield the time-dependent conditional probability density function for finding the system 
in a given well of the potential. This leads directly to the autocorrelation function 
< z(t) z(t + r) > and finally, via the Wiener-Khinchine theorem, to the power spectral den- 
sity P(fl). The details are given by Bulsara, Jacobs, Zhou, Moss and Kiss (1991): 
P(n)= vs(4r0 +as) 4r0 +a s + v2(r� +as) 
where the first term on the right-hand-side represents the noise background, the second 
term being the signal strength. Taking into account the finite bandwidth of the measuring 
system, we replace (for the purpose of comparison with experimental results) the delta- 
function in (6) by the quantity (Aco)- where Aco is the width of a frequency bin in the 
(experimental) Fourier transformation. We introduce signal-to-noise ratio SNR = 10log R in 
decibels, where R is given by 
4c%0s - . (7) 
R  1 + DS(4ro  +w2) D s(4ro  +w) 8cSr � 
In writing down the above expressions, the approximate Kramers rate (4b) has been used. 
However, in what follows, we discuss the effects of replacing it by the exact expression (4a). 
The location of the maximum of the SNR is found by differentiating the above equation; it 
depends on the amplitude  and the frequency co of the modulation, as well as the additive 
noise variance D and the parameters a and b in the potential. 
The SNR computed via the above expression increases as the modulation frequency is 
lowered relative to the Kramers frequency. Lowering the modulation frequency also shar- 
pens the resonance peak, and shifts it to lower noise values, an effect that has been demon- 
strated, for example, by Bulsara, Jacobs, Zhou, Moss and Kiss (i991). The above may be 
readily explained. The effect of the weak modulating signal is to alternately raise and lower 
the potential well with respect to the barrier height U0. In the absence of noise and for 
 << U0, the system cannot switch states, i.e. no information is transferred to the output. In 
the presence of noise, however, the system can switch states through stochastic activation 
over the barrier. Although the switching process is statistical, the transition probability is 
periodically modulated by the external signal. Hence, the output will be correlated, to some 
degree, with the input signal (the modulation 'clocks' the escape events and the whole pro- 
cess will
