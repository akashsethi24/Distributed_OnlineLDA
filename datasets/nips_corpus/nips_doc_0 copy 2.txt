ABSTRACT 
The potential for presynaptic information processing within the arbor 
of a single axon will be discussed in this paper. Current knowledge about 
the activity dependence of the firing threshold, the conditions required for 
conduction failure, and the similarity of nodes along a single axon will be 
reviewed. An electronic circuit model for a site of low conduction safety in 
an axon will be presented. In response to single frequency stimulation the 
electronic circuit acts as a lowpass filter. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
The axon is often modeled as a wire which imposes a fixed delay on a 
propagating signal. Using this model, neural information processing is 
performed by synaptically summing weighted contributions of the outputs 
from other neurons. However, substantial information processing may be 
performed in by the axon itself. Numerous researchers have observed 
periodic conduction failures at norma.,[ physiological impulse activity rates 
(e.g., in cat 1, in frog 2, and in man'). The oscillatory nature of these 
conduction failures is a result of the dependence of the firing threshold on 
past impulse conduction activity. 
The simplest view of axonal (presynaptic) information processing is 
as a switch: the axon will either conduct an impulse or not. The state of 
the switch depends on how past impulse activity modulates the firing 
threshold, which will result in conduction failure if firing threshold is bigger 
than the incoming impulse strength. In this way, the connectivity of a 
synaptic neural network could be modulated by past impulse activity at 
sites of conduction failure within the network. More sophisticated 
presynaptic neural information processing is possible when the axon has 
more than one terminus, implying the existence of branch points within the 
axon. Section II will present a general description of potential for 
presynaptic information processing. 
The after-effects of previous activity are able to vary the connectivity 
of the axonal arbor at sites of low conduction safety according to the 
temporal pattern of the impulse train at each site (Raymond and Lettvin, 
1978; Raymond, 1979). In order to understand the information processing 
potential of presynaptic networks it is necessary to study the after-effects 
of activity on the firing threshold. Each impulse is normally followed by a 
brief refractory period (about 10 ms in frog sciatic nerve) of increased

threshold and a longer superexcitable period (about I s in frog sciatic 
nerve) during which the threshold is actually below its resting level. 
During prolonged periods of activity, there is a gradual increase in firing 
threshold which can persist long (> I hour in frog nerve) after cessation 
of impulse activity (Raymond and Lettvin, 1978). In section III, the 
methods used to measure the firing threshold and the after-effects of 
activity will be presented. 
In addition to understanding how impulse activity modulates sites of 
low conduction safety, it is important to explore possible constraints on 
the distribution of sites of low conduction safety within the axon's arbor. 
Section IV presents results from a study of the distribution of the after- 
effects of activity along an axon. 
Section V presents an electronic circuit model for a region of low 
conduction safety within an axonal arbor. It has been designed to have a 
firing threshold that depends on the past activity in a manner similar to the 
activity dependence measured for frog sciatic nerve. 
II. PRESYNAPTIC SIGNAL PROCESSING 
Conduction failure has been observed in many different organisms, 
including man, at normal physiological activity rates. TM The after- 
effects of activity can modulate conduction failures at a site of low 
conduction safety. One common place where the conduction safety is low 
is at branch points where an impedance mismatch occurs in the axon. 
In order to clarify the meaning of presynaptic information processing, 
a simple example is in order. Parnas reported that in crayfish a single 
axon separately activates the medial (DEA. and lateral (DEAL) branches 
of the deep abdominal extensor muscles. ' At low stimulus frequencies 
(below 40-50 Hz) impulses travel down both branches; however, each 
impulse evokes much smaller contractions in DEAL than in DEAM resulting 
in contraction of DEAM without significant contraction of DEAL. At higher 
stimulus frequencies conduction in the branch leading to DEAM fails and 
DEAL contracts without DEAM contracting. Both DEAL and DEAM can be 
stimulated separately by stimulus patterns more complicated than a single 
frequency. 
The theory of fallible trees, which has been discussed by Lettvin, 
McCulloch and Pitts, Raymond, and Waxman and Grossman among 
others, suggests that one axon which branches many times forms an 
information processing element with one input and many outputs. Thus, 
the after-effects of previous activity are able to vary the connectivity of 
the axonal arbor at regions of low conduction safety according to the 
temporal pattern of the impulse train in each branch. The transfer function 
of the fallible tree is determined by the distribution of sites of low 
conduction safety and the distribution of superexcitability and depressibility 
at those sites. Thus, a single axon with 1000 terminals can potentially be 
in 2 ��� different states as a function of the locations of sites of conduction 
failure within the axonal arbor. And, each site of low conduction safety is 
156 
modulated by the past impulse activity at that site. 
Fallible trees have a number of interesting properties. They can be 
used to cause different input frequencies to excite different axonal 
terminals. Also, fallible trees, starting at rest, will preserve timing 
information in the input signal; i.e., starting from rest, all branches will 
respond to the first impulse, 
III. AFTER-EFFECTS OF ACTIVITY 
In this section, the firing threshold will be defined and an experimental 
method for its measurement will be described. In addition, the after- 
effects of activity will be characterized and typical results of the 
characterization process will be given. 
The following method was used to measure the firing threshold. 
Whole nerves were placed in the experimental setup (shown in figure 1). 
The whole nerve fiber was stimulated with a gross electrode. The 
response from a single axon was recorded using a suction microelectrode. 
Firing threshold was measured by applying test stimuli through the gross 
stimulating electrode and looking for a response in the suction 
microelectrode.

Threshold Hunting, a process for choosing the test stimulus strength, 
was used to characterize the axons. 6 It uses the following paradigm. A 
test stimulus which fails to elicit a conducting impulse causes a small 
increase the strength of subsequent test stimuli. A test stimulus which 
157 
elicits an impulse causes a small decrease in the strength of subsequent 
test stimuli. Conditioning Stimuli, ones large enough to guarantee firing an 
impulse, can be interspersed between test stimuli in order to achieve a 
controlled overall activity rate. Rapid variations in threshold following one 
or more conditioning impulses can be measured by slowly increasing the 
time delay between the conditioning stimuli and the test stimulus. Several 
phases follow each impulse. First, there is a refractory period of short 
duration (about 10ms in frog nerve) during which another impulse cannot 
be initiated. Following the refractory period the axon actually becomes 
more excitable than at rest for a period (ranging from 200ms to ls in frog 
nerve, see figure 2). The superexcitable period is measured by applying a 
conditioning stimulus and then delaying by a gradually increasing time 
delay and applying a test stimulus (see figure 3). There is only a slight 
increase in the peak of the superexcitable period following multiple 
impulses. 7 The superexcitability of an axon was characterized by the % 
decrease of the threshold from its resting level at the peal< of the 
superexcitable period.

During a period of repetitive impulse conduction, the firing threshold may 
gradually increase. After the period of increased impulse activity ends, the 
threshold gradually recovers from its maximum over the course of several 
minutes or more with complete return of the threshold to its resting level 
taking as long as an hour or two (in frog nerve) depending on the extent of 
the preceding impulse activity. The depressibility of an axon can be 
characterized by the initial upward slope of the depression and the time 
158 
constant of the recovery phase (see figure 4). The pattern of conditioning 
and test stimuli used to generate the curve in figure 4 is shown in figure 5. 
Depression may be correlated with microanatomical changes which 
occur ir the glial cells in the nodal region during periods of increased 
activity.- During periods of repetitive stimulation the size and number of 
extracellular paranodal intramyelinic vacuoles increases causing changes 
in the paranodal geometry.
