ABSTRACT
INTRODUCTION 
To us, and to other biological organisms, vision seems effortless. We open 
our eyes and we see the world in all its color, brightness, and movement. 
Yet, we have great difficulties when trying to endow our machines with similar 
abilities. In this paper we shall describe recent developments in the theory of 
early vision which lead from the formulation of the motion problem as an ill- 
posed one to its solution by minimizing certain cost functions. These cost 
or energy functions can be mapped onto simple analog and digital resistive 
networks. Thus, we shall see how the optical flow can be computed by injecting 
currents into resistive networks and recording the resulting stationary voltage 
distribution at each node. These networks can be implemented in cMOS VLSI 
circuits and represent plausible candidates for biological vision systems. 
APERTURE PROBLEM AND SMOOTHNESS ASSUMPTION 
In this study, we use intensity-based schemes for recovering motion. Let us 
derive an equation relating the change in image brightness to the motion of the 
image (seea). Let us assume that the brightness of the image is constant over 
time: d]'(z,y,t)/dt = 0. On the basis of the chain rule of differentiation, this 
transforms into 
OI da OI dy 
Om d- q Oy d-- + at = I,u + Iv + I, : V I. v + It = O, (1) 
where we define the velocity v as (u, v) = (da/dt, dy/dt). Because we assume 
that we can compute these spatial and temporal image gradients, we are now 
left with a single linear equation in two unknowns, u and v, the two components 
of the velocity vector (aperture problem). Any measuring system with a finite 
aperture, whether biological or artificial, can only sense the velocity component 
perpendicular to the edge or along the spatial gradient (-It/ ]Vï¿½ ]). The 
component of motion perpendicular to the gradient cannot, in principle, be 
registered. The problem remains unchanged even if we measure these velocity 
components at many points throughout the image. 
How can this problem be made well-posed, that is, having a unique solu- 
tion depending continuously on the data? One form of regulari.ing ill-posed

problerns is to restrict the class of admissible solutions by imposing appropriate 
constraints '. Applying this method to motion, we shall argue that in gen- 
eral objects are smoothmexcept at isolated discontinuitiesmundergoing smooth 
movements. Thus, in general, neighboring points in the world will have similar 
velocities and the projected velocity field should reflect this fact. We therefore 
impose on the velocity field the constraint that it should be the smoothest as well 
as satisfying the data. As measure of smoothness we choose, the square of the 
velocity field gradient. The final velocity field (u, v) is the one that minimizes 
E(u,v) = ff (I,,u + l',v + I) ' +

the optical flow in the presence of discontinuities. The conductances Tc-j con- 
necting both grids depend on the brightness gradient, as do the conductances 
g and g connecting each node with the battery. For clarity, only two such 
elements are shown. The battery E 0 depends on both the temporal and the 
spatial gradient and is zero if no brightness change occurs. The :: (resp. y) com- 
ponent of the velocity is given by the voltage in the top (resp. bottom) network. 
Binary switches, which make or break the resistive connections between nodes, 
424 
implement motion discontinuities. These switches could be under the control of 
distributed digital processors. Analog cMOS implementations are also feasible s . 
The first term implements the constraint that the final solution should follow 
as closely as possible the measured data whereas the second term imposes the 
smoothness constraint on the solution. The degree to which one or the other 
terms are minimized is governed by the parameter ),. If the data is very ac- 
curate, it should be expensive to violate the first term and ), will be small. 
If, conversely, the data is unreliable (low signal-to-noise), much more emphasis 
will be placed on the smoothness term. Horn and Schunck x first formulated this 
variational approach to the motion problem. 
The energy E(u,v) is quadratic in the unknown u and v. It then follows 
from standard calculus of variation that the associated Euler-Lagrange equations 
will be linear in u and v: 
(3) 
We now have two linear equations at every point and our problem is therefore 
completely determined. 
ANALOG RESISTIVE NETWORKS 
Let us assume that we are formulating eqs. (2) and (3) on a discrete 2-D 
grid, such as the one shown in fig. la. Equation (3) then transforms into

where we replaced the Laplacian with its 5 point approximation on a rectangular 
grid. We shall now show that this set of linear equations can be solved naturally 
using a particular simple resistive network. Let us apply Kirchhoff's current law 
to the nodne i, j in the top layer of the resistive network shown in fig. lb. We 
then have the following update equation:

where vii is the voltage at node i,j in the bottom network. Once duij/dt = 0 
and dvii/dt -- O, this equation is seen to be identical with eq. (4), if we identify

six analog-digital cycles. 
Once we set the batteries and the conductances to the values indicated in 
eq. (6), the network will settlemfollowing Kirchhoff's lawsminto the state of 
least power dissipation. The associated stationary voltages correspond to the 
sought solution: uii is equivalent to the a: component and vii to the y component 
of the optical flow field. 
We simulated the behavior of these networks by solving the above circuit 
equations on parallel computers of the Hypercube family. As boundary condi- 
tions we copied the initial velocity data at the edge of the image into the nodes 
lying directly adjacent but outside the image. 
The sequences in figs. 2 and 3 illustrate the resulting optical flow for syn- 
thetic and natural images. As discussed by Horn and Schunck , the smoothness 
constraint leads to a qualitatively correct estimate of the velocity field. Thus, 
one undifferentiated blob appears to move to the lower right and one blob to 
the upper left. However, at the occluding edge where both squares overlap, the 
smoothness assumption results in a spatial average of the two opposing veloc- 
ities, and the estimated velocity is very small or zero. In parts of the image 
where the brightness gradient is zero and thus no initial velocity data exists (for 
instance, the interiors of the two squares), the velocity estimates are simply the 
spatial average of the neighboring velocity estimates. These empty areas will 
eventually fill in from the boundary, similar to the flow of heat for a uniform 
fiat plate with hot boundaries. 
MOTION DISCONTINUITIES 
The smoothness assumption of Horn and Schunck  regularizes the aperture 
problem and leads to the qualitatively correct velocity field inside moving ob- 
jects. However, this approach fails to detect the locations at which the velocity 
changes abruptly or discontinuously. Thus, it smoothes over the figure-ground 
discontinuity or completely fails to detect the boundary between two objects 
with differing velocities because the algorithm combines velocity information 
across motion boundaries. 
A quite successful strategy for dealing with discontinuities was proposed by 
Geman and Geman s. We shall not rigorously develop their approach, which is 
based on Bayesian estimation theory (for details seeS,e). Suffice it to say that 
a priori knowledge, for instance, that the velocity field should in general be 
smooth, can be formulated in terms of a Markov Random Field model of the 
image. Given such an image model, and given noisy data, we then estimate 
the best flow field by some likelihood criterion. The one we will use here 
427 
is the maximum a posterfort estimate, although other criteria are possible and 
have certain advantages 6. This can be shown to be equivalent to minimizing an 
expression such as eq. (2). 
In order to reconstruct images consisting of piecewise constant segments, 
Geman and Geman s further introduced the powerful idea of a line process I. 
For our purposes, we will assume that a line process can be in either one of two 
states: on (I = 1) or off (I = 0). They are located on a reg.ar lattice set 
between the original pixel lattice (see fig. la), such that each pixel i,j has a 
h and a vertical line process associated with it. If the appropriate 
horizontal Ii5 I 0 
line process is turned on, the smoothness term between the two adjacent pixels 
will be set to zero. In order to prevent line processes from forming everywhere
