Abstract 
Perceptual learning is defined as fast improvement in performance and 
retention of the learned ability over a period of time. In a set of psy- 
chophysical experiments we demonstrated that perceptual learning oc- 
curs for the discrimination of direction in stochastic motion stimuli. Here 
we model this learning using two approaches: a clustering model that 
learns to accommodate the motion noise, and an averaging model that 
learns to ignore the noise. Simulations of the models show performance 
similar to the psychophysical results. 
I Introduction 
Global motion perception is critical to many visual tasks: to perceive self-motion, 
to identify objects in motion, to determine the structure of the environment, and 
to make judgements for safe navigation. In the presence of noise, as in random dot 
kinematograms, efficient extraction of global motion involves considerable spatial 
integration. Newsome and Colleagues (1989) showed that neurons in the macaque 
middle temporal area (MT) are motion direction-selective, and perform global inte- 
gration of motion in their large receptive fields. Psychophysical studies in humans 
have characterized the limits of spatial and temporal integration in motion (Wata- 
maniuk et. al, 1984) and the nature of the underlying motion computations (Vaina 
et. al 1990).

Since the psychophysical and neural substrate of global motion are fairly well un- 
derstood, we were interested to see whether the perception of direction in such 
global motion stimuli can improve with practice. Studies specifically addressing 
this question for other early perceptual tasks have shown that improvements of per- 
formance obtained in the first experimental session are preserved in a subsequent 
session and retained over weeks. This is considered as perceptual learning (Gibson, 
1953). Psychophysical studies of perceptual learning show that the beneficial effects 
of practice are lost if some stimulus parameters are changed significantly, such as 
orientation, spatial frequency or location in the visual field. Based on the time scale 
necessary for the improvement to occur, two major learning paradigms have been 
used in perceptual learning: slow, progressive learning (several thousand trials are 
required to reach stable performance) and fast learning (improvement occurs and 
stabilizes in the first 100-200 trials). 
The idea of fast learning and the nature of its limits is attractive from a compu- 
tational point of view because it encourages the exploration of practice-dependent 
plasticity found in the adult early visual system (Frgnac et. al., 1988, Gilbert and 
Wiesel 1992). A recent line of research in biologically motivated learning models 
originated by Poggio (Poggio, 1990) takes perceptual learning as evidence thatthe 
brain may be able to synthesize-possibly in the cortex-appropriate task-specific 
modules that receive input from retinotopic cells and learn to solve the task after 
a short training phase in which they are exposed to examples of the task. Poggio 
and colleagues (1992) have illustrated this approach in learning vernier hyperacuity. 
Here, we adopted this general framework to study learning of direction in global 
motion. In contrast to Poggio et. al's supervised learning paradigm, we used unsu- 
pervised learning both in the psychophysical experiments and modeling of learning. 
We designed a set of psychophysical tasks to study whether fast learning occurs in 
discrimination of opposite directions of global motion and to explore the limits of 
this learning. To model the learning, we studied two models that differ in the way 
they deal with noise. 
2 Psychophysics 
Ball and Sekuler (1982, 1987) showed that discriminability of the direction of motion 
of two random dot patterns improved with training. In this learning paradigm, more 
than 2000 trials are required for reaching a stable performance. Such a slow learn- 
ing time scale has been reported for the learning of other perceptual tasks, such as 
vernier acuity (McKee and Westheimer 1978, Fahle 1994), stereoacuity (Fendick and 
Westheimer, 1983; Ramachandran and Braddick 1973) and discrimination of line 
orientation (Vogels and Orban 1985). In contrast to this slow learning, Fiorentini 
and Berardi (1981) showed that for learning the discrimination of complex grat- 
ings with two harmonics of different spatial phase, 100-200 trials suffice. Similarly 
Poggio et. al. (1992) show that a small number of trials suffice for significantly 
improving performance on a vernier hyperacuity task. Both studies discussed the 
specificity of learning to the stimulus attributes. 
In our study, we used a two-alternative, forced-choice psychophysical procedure to 
measure the subject's ability to discriminate between two opposite directions of mo- 
tion in dynamic random dot patterns in which 25% of the dots provide a correlated

of the reminder 75% of dots (Fig. l(a)). Each trial lasted 90 msec during which two 
frames were presented (with inter-frame interval equal to zero). A session consisted 
of 4-6 blocks of 40 trials each. Feedback was not provided during the experimental 
sessions. Observers were required to maintain fixation on a fixation mark placed at 
2 ï¿½ from the imaginary circumference of the stimulus. 
To investigate the effects of practice and their retention, the discrimination of left- 
ward vs rightward direction of motion in the display was tested first on each exper- 
imental session for 3 consecutive days and repeated 10 days later. The results are 
presented in Fig. l(b). For most observers, a fast and dramatic improvement was 
seen in the first day. Fig. l(b) shows that learning was maintained in subsequent 
days, and even ten days later without any training in between. Examination of the 
individual observers' data revealed that improvement of performance occurred only 
if they started above chance level. This suggests that this fast learning might imply 
the improvement of an existing representation of the stimulus. 
In additional experiments, we did not find transfer to another direction of motion 
(up/down), indicating that the learning is selective to specific characteristics of 
the stimulus. Details of experiments testing the limits of the learning appear in 
Vaina et. al (1995). 
3 Modeling 
We propose two paradigms to model the learning found in psychophysics. Both 
use directionally-tuned units with properties similar to those of neurons found in 
MT (Maunsell and Van Essen, 1983). Schematic MT neurons used in our modeling 
integrate global information by summing over localized responses: 
 _(2__ (0_0,?) 
= 
i=l 
where ah is the standard deviation of the tuning, and information from n local 
responses is taken into account. The responses of a collection of such units (each

tuned to a different direction) form the input vector to the models. 
3.1 Learning to accommodate 
This model is based on grouping similar data. In this paradigm, after learning, the 
network has an estimate of the contribution of noise, and takes it into account when 
performing the task of discriminating between two different directions of motion; 
so, we say that the model learns to accommodate the noise. 
Fig 2(a) contains a schematic of this model. The representation vector consists of 
responses xi.x2,..., Xn of the directionally-tuned units.. Clustering is done in the 
space of the representation vectors. The model is a combination of HyperBF-like 
functions and clustering (Poggio et. al, 1992, Moody and Darken 1989). We use 
gaussians with mean at the cluster centers, and move the cluster centers by a 
learning algorithm. 
A cluster gaussian computes a gaussian function of the representation vector for 
the current stimulus from the current center of the corresponding cluster. We say 
current because the center is moved as the learning proceeds. At any given point, 
a center is at the current best estimate of the center of the corresponding data 
cluster. More precisely, the learning rule to modify the jth coordinate of the center 
is given by: 
c(t+) _ _(t) + rl * (x t) _(t)  
w,j - cw,j - %,j, (2) 
where w is the index of winning cluster and c, is the jth coordinate of the 
center for the wth cluster. This moves the center towards the new data vector X 
that has been judged to belong to the wth cluster. The parameter r/controls the 
learning rate.

3.2 Learning to ignore 
The learning involved in this approach is Hebbian, and is termed learning to ig- 
nore, because in this weighted averaging scheme, as learning occurs, the weights 
for the noise response are progressively reduced to zero, leaving only the contribu- 
tion from the signal. In other words, the network learns to ignore the noise (Vaina 
et. al 1995).
