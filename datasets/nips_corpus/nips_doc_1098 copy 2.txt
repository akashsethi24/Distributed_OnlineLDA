Abstract 
A new approach for clustering is proposed. This method is based 
on an analogy to a physical model; the ferromagnetic Potts model 
at thermal equilibrium is used as an analog computer for this hard 
optimization problem. We do not assume any structure of the un- 
derlying distribution of the data. Phase space of the Potts model is 
divided into three regions; ferromagnetic, super-paramagnetic and 
paramagnetic phases. The region of interest is that corresponding 
to the super-paramagnetic one, where domains of aligned spins ap- 
pear. The range of temperatures where these structures are stable 
is indicated by a non-vanishing magnetic susceptibility. We use a 
very efficient Monte Carlo algorithm to measure the susceptibil- 
ity and the spin spin correlation function. The values of the spin 
spin correlation function, at the super-paramagnetic phase, serve 
to identify the partition of the data points into clusters. 
Many natural phenomena can be viewed as optimization processes, and the drive to 
understand and analyze them yielded powerful mathematical methods. Thus when 
wishing to solve a hard optimization problem, it may be advantageous to apply these 
methods through a physical analogy. Indeed, recently techniques from statistical 
physics have been adapted for solving hard optimization problems (see e.g. Yuille 
and Kosowsky, 1994). In this work we formulate the problem of clustering in terms 
of a ferromagnetic Potts spin model. Using the Monte Carlo method we estimate 
physical quantities such as the spin spin correlation function and the susceptibility, 
and deduce from them the number of clusters and cluster sizes. 
Cluster analysis is an important technique in exploratory data analysis and is ap- 
plied in a variety of engineering and scientific disciplines. The problem of partitional 
clustering can be formally stated as follows. With every one of i = 1, 2,...N pat- 
terns represented as a point i in a d-dimensional metric space, determine the 
partition of these N points into M groups, called clusters, such that points in a 
cluster are more similar to each other than to points in different clusters. The value 
of M also has to be determined. 
Clustering Data through an Analogy to the Potts Model 417 
The two main approaches to partitional clustering are called parametric and non- 
parametric. In parametric approaches some knowledge of the clusters' structure is 
assumed (e.g. each cluster can be represented by a center and a spread around 
it). This assumption is incorporated in a global criterion. The goal is to assign the 
data points so that the criterion is minimized. A typical example is variance min- 
imization (Rose, Gurewitz, and Fox, 1993). On the other hand, in non-parametric 
approaches a local criterion is used to build clusters by utilizing local structure of 
the data. For example, clusters can be formed by identifying high-density regions 
in the data space or by assigning a point and its K-nearest neighbors to the same 
cluster. In recent years many parametric partitional clustering algorithms rooted 
in statistical physics were presented (see e.g. Buhmann and Kiihnel , 1993). In the 
present work we use methods of statistical physics in non-parametric clustering. 
Our aim is to use a physical problem as an analog to the clustering problem. The 
notion of clusters comes very naturally in Potts spin models (Wang and Swendsen, 
1990) where clusters are closely related to ordered regions of spins. We place a Potts 
spin variable si at each point ai (that represents one of the patterns), and introduce 
a short range ferromagnetic interaction Jij between pairs of spins, whose strength 
decreases as the inter-spin distance [[ai- aj [[ increases. The system is governed by 
the Hamiltonian (energy function) 
= 
<i,j> 
where the notation < i, j > stands for neighboring points i and j in a sense that is 
defined later. Then we study the ordering properties of this inhomogeneous Potts 
model. 
As a concrete example, place a Potts spin at each of the data points of fig. 1.

Figure 1: This data set is made of three rectangles, each consisting of 800 points 
uniformly distributed, and a uniform rectangular background of lower density, also 
consisting of 800 points. Points classified (with Tcus = 0.08 and  = 0.5) as 
belonging to the three largest clusters are marked by crosses, squares and x's. The 
fourth cluster is of size 2 and all others are single point clusters marked by triangles. 
At high temperatures the system is in a disordered (paramagnetic) phase. As 
the temperature is lowered, larger and larger regions of high density of points (or 
spins) exhibit local ordering, until a phase transition occurs and spins in the three 
rectangular high density regions become completely aligned (i.e. within each region 
all si take the same value - super-paramagnetic phase). 
The aligned regions define the clusters which we wish to identify. As the temperature

is further lowered, a pseudo-transition occurs and the system becomes completely 
ordered (ferromagnetic). 
I A mean field model 
To support our main idea, we analyze an idealized set of points where the division 
into natural classes is distinct. The points are divided into M groups. The distance 
between any two points within the same group is d while the distance between any 
two points belonging to different groups is d2 > d (d can be regarded as a similarity 
index). Following our main idea, we associate a Potts spin with each point and an 
interaction J between points separated by distance d and an J2 between points 
separated by d2, where 0 _ J2 < J. Hence the Hamiltonian (1) becomes; 
7-/ = J J2 
' N  ' ' 
t i<j t<t i,j 
where s denotes the i th spin (i-- 1,..., ) of the yth group (y - 1,...,M). 
From standard mean field theory for the Potts model (Wu, 1982) it is possible to 
show that the transition from the ferromagnetic phase to the paramagnetic phase 
q- [J1 + (M- 1)J2] The average spin spin correlation 
is at Tc- 2M (q-1)log(q-X) ' 
-- i for all points Zi and j; i.ï¿½. the spin 
function, 5s:,sj at the paramagnetic phase is q 
value at each point is independent of the others. The ferromagnetic phase is further 
divided into two regions. At low temperatures, with high probability, all spins are 
aligned; that is 5s,,s  i for all i and j. At intermediate temperatures, between T* 
and To, only spins of the same group  are aligned with high probability; 5s,,s  1, 
while spins belonging to different groups,/ and , are independent; 5s,,,s m ?. 
The spin spin correlation function at the super-paramagnetic phase can be used 
to decide whether or not two spins belong to the same cluster. In contrast with 
the mere inter-point distance, the spin spin correlation function is sensitive to the 
collective behavior of the system and is therefore a suitable quantity for defining 
collective structures (clusters). 
The transition temperature T  may be calculated and shown to be proportional to 
J2; T  = a(N, M, q) J2. In figure 2 we present the phase diagram, in the (T  
plane, for the case M = 4, N - 1000 and q - 6.

The phase diagram fig. 2 shows that the existence of natural classes can manifest 
itself in the thermodynamic properties of the proposed Potts model. Thus our 
approach is supported, provided that a correct choice of the interaction strengths 
is made.

2 Definition of local interaction 
In order to minimize the intra-cluster interaction it is convenient to allow an interac- 
tion only between neighbors. In common with other local methods, we assume 
that there is a 'local length scale'  a, whid is defined by the high density regions 
and is smaller than the typical distance between points in the low density regions. 
This property can be expressed in the ordering properties of the Potts system by 
choosing a short range interaction. Therefore we consider that each point interacts 
only with its neighbors with interaction strength 
lexp( 
Two points, i and gj, are defined as neighbors if they have a mutuM neighborhood 
value K; that is, if gi is one of the K nearest neighbors of j and vice-versa. This 
definition ensures that Jij is symmetric; the number of bonds of any site is less 
than K. We chose the local length scale, a, to be the average of all distances 
between pairs i and j with a mutual neighborhood value K. K is the 
average number of neighbors per site; i.e it is twice the number of non vanishing 
interactions, Jij divided by the number of points N (This careful normalization of 
the interaction strength enables us to estimate the critical temperature T for any 
data. sample). 
3 Calculation of thermodynamic quantities 
The ordering properties of the system are reflected by the susceptibility and the 
spin spin correlation function 5,,, where ..- stands for a thermal average. These 
quantities can be estimated by averaging over the configurations generated by a 
Monte Carlo procedure. We use the Swendsen-Wang (Wang and Swendsen, 1990) 
Monte Carlo algorithm for the Potts model (1) not only because of its high efficiency, 
but also because it utilizes the SW clusters. As will be explained the SW clusters 
are strongly connected to the clusters we wish to identify. A layman's explanation 
of the method is as follows. The SW procedure stoc
