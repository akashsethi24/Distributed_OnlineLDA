Abstract 
A figure-ground segregation network is proposed based on a novel 
boundary pair representation. Nodes in the network are bound- 
ary segments obtained through local grouping. Each node is ex- 
citatorily coupled with the neighboring nodes that belong to the 
same region, and inhibitorily coupled with the corresponding paired 
node. Gestalt grouping rules are incorporated by modulating con- 
nections. The status of a node represents its probability being 
figural and is updated according to a differential equation. The 
system solves the figure-ground segregation problem through tem- 
poral evolution. Different perceptual phenomena, such as modal 
and amodal completion, virtual contours, grouping and shape de- 
composition are then explained through local diffusion. The system 
eliminates combinatorial optimization and accounts for many psy- 
chophysical results with a fixed set of parameters. 
i Introduction 
Perceptual organization refers to the ability of grouping similar features in sensory 
data. This, at a minimum, includes the operations of grouping and figure-ground 
segregation, which refers to the process of determining relative depths of adjacent 
regions in input data and thus proper occlusion hierarchy. Perceptual organization 
has been studied extensively and many of the existing approaches [5] [4] [8] [10] [3] 
start from detecting discontinuities, i.e. edges in the input; one or several configura- 
tions are then selected according to certain criteria, for example, non-accidentalness 
[5]. Those approaches have several disadvantages for perceptual organization. Edges 
should be localized between regions and an additional ambiguity, the ownership of 
a boundary segment, is introduced, which is equivalent to figure-ground segrega- 
tion [7]. Due to that, regional attributions cannot be associated with boundary 
segments. Furthermore, because each boundary segment can belong to different 
regions, the potential search space is combinatorial. 
To overcome some of the problems, we propose a laterally-coupled network based on 
a boundary-pair representation to resolve figure-ground segregation. An occluding 
boundary is represented by a pair of boundaries of the two associated regions, and

initiates a competition between the regions. Each node in the network represents a 
boundary segment. Regions compete to be figural through boundary-pair competi- 
tion and figure-ground segregation is resolved through temporal evolution. Gestalt 
grouping rules are incorporated by modulating coupling strengths between different 
nodes within a region, which influences the temporal dynamics and determines the 
percept of the system. Shape decomposition and grouping are then implemented 
through local diffusion using the results from figure-ground segregation. 
2 Figure-Ground Segregation Network 
The central problem in perceptual organization is to determine relative depths 
among regions. As figure reversal occurs in certain circumstances, figure-ground 
segregation cannot be resolved only based on local attributes. 
2.1 The Network Architecture 
The boundary-pair representation is motivated by on- and off-center cells, shown 
in Fig. l(a). Fig. l(b) shows an input image and Fig. l(c) and (d) show the 
on- and off-center responses. Without zero-crossing, we naturally obtain double 
responses for each occluding boundary, as shown in Fig. l(e). In our boundary-pair 
representation, each boundary is uniquely associated with a region. 
In this paper, we obtain closed region boundaries from segmentation and form 
boundary segments using corners and junctions, which are detected through local 
corner and junction detectors. A node i in the figure-ground segregation network 
represents a boundary segment, and Pi represents its probability being figural, which 
is set to 0.5 initially. Each node is laterally coupled with neighboring nodes on the 
closed boundary. The connection weight from node i to j, wig, is 1 and can be 
modified by T-junctions and local shape information. Each occluding boundary is 
represented by a pair of boundary segments of the involved regions. For example, 
in Fig. 2(a), nodes 1 and 5 form a boundary pair, where node 1 belongs to the 
white region and node 5 belongs to the black region. Node i updates its status by: 
dPi 
' d---=Iz  wki(Pk -- Pi) +/j(1 - Pi)  H(Qii) +/s(1 - Pi) exp(--) (1) 
Here N(i) is the set of neighboring nodes of i, and/, /g, and/B are parameters 
to determine the influences from lateral connections, junctions, and bias. J(i) is

Figure 2: (a) The figure-ground segregation network for Fig. l(b). Nodes 1, 2, 3 
and 4 belong to the white region; nodes 5, 6, 7, and 8 belong to the black region; 
and nodes 9 and 10, and nodes 11 and 12 belong to the left and right gray regions 
respectively. Solid lines represent excitatory coupling while dashed lines represent 
inhibitory connections. (b) Result after surface completion. Left and right gray 
regions are grouped together. 
the set of junctions that are associated with i and Qli is the junction strength of 
node i of junction 1. H(x) is given by H(x) = tanh(3(x - 8j)), where 3 controls 
the steepness and 0j is a threshold. 
In (1), the first term on the right reflects the lateral influences. When nodes are 
strongly coupled, they are more likely to be in the same status, either figure or 
background. The second term incorporates junction information. In other words, 
at a T-junction, segments that vary more smoothly are more likely to be figural. The 
third term is a bias, where Bi is the bias introduced to simulate human perception. 
The competition between paired nodes i and j is through normalization based on 
the assumption that only one of the paired nodes should be figural at a given time: 
p/(t+) _ Piti(Pit + p) and pt+l) __ p/(pi t q_ p). 
2.2 Incorporation of Gestalt Rules 
To generate behavior that is consistent with human perception, we incorporate 
grouping cues and some Gestalt grouping principles. As the network provides a 
generic model, additional grouping rules can also be incorporated. 
T-junctions T-junctions provide important cues for determining relative depths 
[7] [10]. In Williams and Hanson's model [10], T-junctions are imposed as 
topological constraints. Given a T-junction l, the initial strength for node i that is 
associated with I is: 
Qli = exp(-o( i,c( i) ) / KT ) 
1/2 YkN3(l) exp(--a(k,�())/Kr) ' 
where Kr is a parameter, Ng(1) is a set of all the nodes associated with junction l, 
c(i) is the other node in Na(1) that belongs to the same region as node i, and o(ij) 
is the angle between segments i and j. 
Non-accidentalness Non-accidentalness tries to capture the intrinsic relation- 
ships among segments [5]. In our system, an additional connection is introduced to 
node i if it is aligned well with a node j from the same region and j �' N(i) initially. 
The connection weight wig is a function of distance and angle between the involved 
ending points. This can be viewed as virtual junctions, resulting in virtual contours 
and conversion of a corner into a T-junction if involved nodes become figural. This 
corresponds to an organization criterion proposed by Geiger et al [3].

Shape information Shape information plays a central role in Gestalt principles 
and is incorporated through enhancing lateral connections. In this paper, we 
consider local symmetry. Let j and k be two neighboring nodes of i: 
wij = 1 + C exp(-lai j - otkil/K,) � exp(-(Lj/Lk + L/Lj - 2)/KL)), 
where C, K,, and KL are parameters and Lj is the length of segment j. Essentially 
the lateral connections are strengthened when two neighboring segments of i are 
symmetric. 
Preferences Human perceptual systems often prefer some organizations over oth- 
ers. Here we incorporated a well-known figure-ground segregation principle, called 
closeness. In other words, the system prefers filled regions over holes. In current 
implementation, we set Bi -- 1.0 if node i is part of a hole and otherwise Bi - O. 
2.3 Temporal Properties of the Network 
After we construct the figure-ground segregation network, each node is updated 
according to (1). Fig. 3 shows the temporal behavior of the network shown in Fig. 
2(a). The system approaches to a stable solution. For figure-ground segregation, we 
can binarize the status of each node using threshold 0.5. Thus the system generates 
the desired percept in a few iterations. The black region occludes other regions 
while gray regions occlude the white region. For example, Ps is close to I and thus 
segment 5 is figural, and P is close to 0 and thus segment I is in the background. 
2.4 Surface Completion 
After figure-ground segregation is resolved, surface completion and shape decompo- 
sition are implemented through diffusion [3]. Each boundary segment is associated 
with regional attributes such as the average intensity value because its ownership 
is known. Boundary segments are then grouped into diffusion groups based on sim- 
ilarities of their regional attribut
