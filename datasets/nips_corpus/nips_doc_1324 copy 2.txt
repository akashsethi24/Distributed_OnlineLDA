Abstract 
This paper describes a small, compact circuit that captures the 
temporal and adaptation properties both of the photoreceptor and 
of the laminar layers of the fly. This circuit uses only six transis- 
tors and two capacitors. It is operated in the subthreshold domain. 
The circuit maintains a high transient gain by using adaptation to 
the background intensity as a form of gain control. The adapta- 
tion time constant of the circuit can be controlled via an external 
bias. Its temporal filtering properties change with the background 
intensity or signal-to-noise conditions. The frequency response of 
the circuit shows that in the frequency range of I to 100 Hz, the 
circuit response goes from highpass filtering under high light levels 
to lowpass filtering under low light levels (i.e., when the signal-to- 
noise ratio is low). A chip with 20x20 pixels has been fabricated 
in 1.2um ORBIT CMOS nwell technology. 
1 BACKGROUND 
The first two layers in the fly visual system are the retina layer and the laminar 
layer. The photoreceptors in the retina synapse onto the monopolar cells in the 
laminar layer. The photoreceptors adapt to the background intensity, and use this 
adaptation as a form of gain control in maintaining a high response to transient 
signals. The laminar layer performs bandpass filtering under high background in- 
tensities, and reverts to lowpass filtering in the case of low background intensities 
where the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio is low. This adaptive filtering response in the 
temporal domain is analogous to the spatial center-surround response of the bipolar 
cells in the vertebrate retina.

The Delbriick silicon receptor circuit (Delbriick, 1994) modeled closely the step re- 
sponses and the adaptation responses of the biological receptors. By including two 
additional transistors, the retino-laminar (RL) circuit described here captures 
the properties of both the photoreceptor layer (i.e., the adaptation properties and 
phototransduction) and the cells in the laminar layer (i.e., the adaptive filtering). 
The time constant of the circuit is controllable via an external bias, and the adapta- 
tion behavior of the circuit over different background intensities is more symmetrical 
than that of Delbriick's photoreceptor circuit. 
2 CIRCUIT DESCRIPTION 
The RL circuit which has the basic form of Delbriick's receptor circuit is shown 
in Figure 1. I have replaced the adaptive element in his receptor circuit by a 
nonlinear resistor consisting of a pFET transistor, Q1. The implementation of a 
floating, voltage-controlled resistor has been described earlier by (Banu and Tsividis, 
1982). The bias for Q1, Vb, is generated by Qa and Q4. The conductance of Q 
is determined by the output voltage, I/i, and an external bias, Vm. We give a brief 
description of the circuit operation here; details are described in (Delbriick, 1994). 
The receptor node, , is clamped to the voltage needed to sink the current sourced

by Q6, which is biased by an external voltage, Vu. Changes in the photocurrent are 
amplified by the transistors, Q2 and Q6, resulting in a change in l(. This change in 
l( is capacitively coupled through the capacitive divider, consisting of (72 and (70, 
into Vp, so that Q5 supplies the extra increase in photocurrent. 
The feedback transistor, Qs, is operated in subthreshold so that V and l( is loga- 
rithmic in the photocurrent. A large change in the photocurrent resulting from a 
change in the background intensity, leads to a large change in the circuit output, 
l(. Significant current then flows through Q, thus charging or discharging Vp. 
3 PROPERTIES OF RL CIRCUIT 
The temporal responses and adaptation properties of this circuit are expounded 
in the following sections. In Section 3.1, we solve for the transfer function of the 
circuit and in Section 3.2, we describe the dependence of the conductance of Q 
on the background intensity. In Sections 3.3 and 3.4, we describe the temporal 
responses of this circuit, and compare the adaptation response of RL circuit with 
that of Delbrfick's circuit. 
3.1 TRANSFER FUNCTION 
We can solve for the transfer function of the RL circuit in Figure I by writing the 
KCL equations of the small-signal model shown in Figure 2. The transfer function,

The frequency response curves in Figure 3 are measured from the fabricated circuit 
over five decades of background intensity. We obtain the curves by using a sine- 
wave-modulated red LED source. The number next to each curve is the log intensity 
of the mean value; 0 log is the intensity of a red LED. We obtain the remaining 
curves by interposing neutral density filters between the LED source and the chip. 
Figure 3 shows that, in the range of I to 100 Hz, the circuit is a bandpass filter 
at high light levels, and reduces to a lowpass filter at low light levels. For each

DEPENDENCE OF CIRCUIT'S TIME CONSTANT ON 
BACKGROUND INTENSITY 
The cutoff frequencies of the circuit depend on the conductance, ga, of Q. Here, 
we analyze the dependence of g on the background intensity. Since Q is operated 
in subthreshold, the conductance depends on the current flowing through Q. The 
I-V relationship for Q1 can be written as

The input stimulus is a red LED driven by a square wave of contrast 0.18. The 
bottom curve corresponding to Delbrfick's receptor has been shifted down so that 
we can compare the two curves. The adaptation response of the RL circuit is more 
symmetrical than that of Delbrfick's circuit when the circuit goes from dark to light 
conditions and back. 
the surface potential of the channel of the transistor. Equation 3 shows that ga 
is proportional to the photocurrent, Iph, hence, the background intensity. A more 
intuitive way of understanding how ga changes with Iph is that the change in Vv 
with a fixed change in the output, I4, depends on the output level of V. The change 
in Vv is larger for a higher DC output, V, because of the increased body effect at 
Q4 due to its higher source voltage. The larger change in V leads to an increase in 
the conductance, ga. 
As Iph increases, ga increases, so the cutoff frequencies shift to the right, as seen in 
Figure 3. If we compare both the 0 curve and the -1 curve, we can see that the 
cutoff frequencies are approximately different by a factor of 10. Thus, the exponent 
of Iph, (1 - nnnp)/n,  1. Since the n values change with the current through the 
transistor, the exponent also changes. The different values of the exponent with 
Iph can be seen from the different amounts of shifts in the cutoff frequencies of the 
curves. 
3.3 TEMPORAL RESPONSES 
The adaptive temporal filtering of the circuit over five decades of background in- 
tensity can also be observed from the step response of the RL circuit to a square- 
wave-modulated LED of contrast 0.15, as shown in Figure 4. The data in Figure 
4 show that the time constant of the circuit increases as the light level decreases. 
The temporal responses observed in these circuits are comparable to the contrast 
responses recorded from the LMCs by Juusola and colleagues (Juusola et ed., 1995). 
3.4 ADAPTATION PROPERTIES 
The RL circuit also differs from Delbrfick's circuit in that the adaptation time 
constant can be set by an external bias. In the Delbrfick circuit, the adaptation t
