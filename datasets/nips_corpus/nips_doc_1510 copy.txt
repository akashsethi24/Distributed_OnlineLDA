Abstract 
Visual search is the task of finding a target in an image against a 
background of distractors. Unique features of targets enable them 
to pop out against the background, while targets defined by lacks of 
features or conjunctions of features are more difficult to spot. It is 
known that the ease of target detection can change when the roles 
of figure and ground are switched. The mechanisms underlying 
the ease of pop out and asymmetry in visual search have been 
elusive. This paper shows that a model of segmentation in V1 based 
on intracortical interactions can explain many of the qualitative 
aspects of visual search. 
1 Introduction 
Visual search is closely related to visual segmentation, and therefore can be used to 
diagnose the mechanisms of visual segmentation. For instance, a red dot can pop- 
out against a background of green distractor dots instantaneously, suggesting that 
only pre-attentive mechanisms are necessary (Treisman et al, 1990). On the other 
hand, it is much more difficult to search for a red 'X' among green 'X's and red 
'O's - the time it takes to detect the target's presence increases with the number of 
background distractors, suggesting some form of attentive serial search. Sometimes, 
the search times change when the role of the figure (target) and ground (distractors) 
are switched -- asymmetry in visual search. For instance, it is easier to find a longer 
bar in a background of shorter bars than vice-versa. 
It has been unclear which visual areas or neural mechanisms are responsible for 
the pop out and asymmetry in visual search. There are, however, psychophysi- 
cal theories (Treisman et al 1990, Treisman and Gormican 1988) which argue that 
visual inputs are coded in a number of primitive or basic feature dimensions: ori- 
entation, color, brightness, motion direction, disparity, line ends, line intersections, 
and closure. A target can pop-out preattentively if it has a feature in one of these 
dimensions, such as a particular color or orientation, which is absent in the distrac-

tors. Hence, a red dot pops out among green ones. However, red 'X' is difficult 
to spot among green 'X's and red 'O's because neither being red nor being 'X' is 
unique for the target, and therefore serial search is required. While a vertical line 
pops out of horizontal ones and vice versa without any search asymmetry, search 
asymmetry will arise when a single feature in which target and distractors differ is 
present in one of the two and absent or reduced in the other. Hence, a long line is 
more easily spotted among short lines than the reserve. This theory has been very 
helpful in understanding search phenomena. However, it has to make assumptions 
about what are the primitive feature dimensions, as well as what constitutes larger 
or smaller values along a given dimension. For instance, to explain that a curved 
line is more easily spotted among straight lines than the reverse, the theory has 
to define straightness as the default or standard, and curvaciousness as the devi- 
ation from this standard and thus an added feature. Empirically, other pairs of 
standard and deviant properties include vertical versus tilted, parallel versus con- 
vergent, short vs long lines, circle vs ellipse, and complete versus incomplete circles. 
The basis behind these assumptions are not completely clear. Other related theories 
have similar problems. For instance, Julesz's texton theory (Julesz 1981) for visual 
segmentation or pop out starts off by assuming a complete set of special features 
that constitute textons. 
This paper proposes and demonstrates in a model that pre-attentive mechanisms 
in V1 can qualitatively explain many of the phenomena of visual search. It is 
assumed that the ease of search is determined by the relative saliencies of the target 
and distractors. Intracortical interactions in V1 alter the saliencies of targets and 
distractors according to their own image features as well as those of the distractor 
or targets images that form the context. Hence, the relative saliency depends on 
the particular target-distractor pair involved. In particular, asymmetry is a natural 
consequence of contextual influences. 
2 The V1 model 
We use a V1 model of pre-attentive visual segmentation which has been shown to 
be able to detect and highlight smooth contours in noisy backgrounds and find 
boundaries between texture regions in images (Li 1998a, 1998b). Its behavior 
agrees with physiological observations (Knierim and van Essen 1992, Kapadia et 
al 1995). Without loss of generality, the model ignores color, motion, and stereo 
dimensions, includes mainly layer 2-3 orientation selective cells, and ignores the 
intra-hypercolumnar mechanism by which their receptive fields are formed. Inputs 
to the model are images filtered by the edge- or bar-like local receptive fields (RFs) 
of V1 cells.  The cells influence each other contextually via horizontal intra-cortical 
connections (Rockland and Lund 1983, Gilbert, 1992), transforming patterns of in- 
puts to patterns of cell responses. Fig. I shows the elements of the model and their 
interactions. At each location i there is a model V1 hypercolumn composed of K 
neuron pairs. Each pair (i, 0) has RF center i and preferred orientation 0 = kr/K 
for k - 1, 2, ...K, and is called (the neural representation of) an edge segment. 
Based on experimental data (White, 1989, Douglas and Martin 1990), each edge 
segment consists of an excitatory and an inhibitory neuron that are interconnected, 
and each model cell represents a collection of local cells of similar types. The exci- 
tatory cell receives the visual input; its output is used as a measure of the response 
or salience of the edge segment and projects to higher visual areas. The inhibitory 
cells are treated as interneurons. Based on observations by Gilbert, Lund and their 
colleagues (Rockland and Lund, 1983, Gilbert 1992) horizontal connections Jio,jo,

Figure 1: A: Visual inputs are sampled in a discrete grid of edge/bar detectors. 
Each grid point i has K neuron pairs (see C), one per bar segment, tuned to 
different orientations 0 spanning 180 �. Two segments at different grid points can 
interact with each other via monosynaptic excitation J (the solid arrow from one 
thick bar to anothe r) or disynaptic inhibition W (the dashed arrow to a thick 
dashed bar). See also C. B: A schematic of the neural connection pattern from the

J's contacts are shown by thin solid bars. W's are shown by thin dashed bars. The 
connection pattern is translation and rotation invariant. C: An input bar segment 
is directly processed by an interconnected pair of excitatory and inhibitory cells, 
each cell models abstractly a local group of cells of the same type. The excitatory 
cell receives visual input and sends output gx (xio) to higher centers. The inhibitory 
cell is an interneuron. Visual space is taken as having periodic boundary conditions.
