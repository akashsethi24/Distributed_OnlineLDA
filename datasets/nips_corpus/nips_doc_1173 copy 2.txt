Abstract 
A simple mathematical model for the large-scale circuitry of pri- 
mary visual cortex is introduced. It is shown that a basic cor- 
tical architecture of recurrent local excitation and lateral inhi- 
bition can account quantitatively for such properties as orien- 
tation tuning. The model can also account for such local ef- 
fects as cross-orientation suppression. It is also shown that non- 
local state-dependent coupling between similar orientation patches, 
when added to the model, can satisfactorily reproduce such ef- 
fects as non-local iso-orientation suppression, and non-local cross- 
orientation enhancement. Following this an account is given of per- 
ceptual phenomena involving object segmentation, such as pop- 
out, and the direct and indirect tilt illusions. 
i INTRODUCTION 
The edge detection mechanism in the primate visual cortex (V1) involves at least 
two fairly well characterized circuits. There is a local circuit operating at sub- 
hypercolumn dimensions comprising strong orientation specific recurrent excitation 
and weakly orientation specific inhibition. The other circuit operates between hy- 
percolumns, connecting cells with similar orientation preferences separated by sev- 
eral millimetres of cortical tissue. The horizontal connections which mediate this

circuit have been extensively studied. These connections are ideally structured to 
provide local cortical processes with information about the global nature of stim- 
uli. Thus they have been invoked to explain a wide variety of context dependent 
visual processing. A good example of this is the tilt illusion (TI), where surround 
stimulation causes a misperception of the angle of tilt of a grating. 
The interaction between such local and long-range circuits has also been inves- 
tigated. Typically these experiments involve the separate stimulation of a cells 
receptive field (the classical receptive field or center) and the immediate region 
outside the receptive field (the non-classical receptive field or surround). In the 
first part of this work we present a simple model of cortical center-surround inter- 
action. Despite the simplicity of the model we are able to quantitatively reproduce 
many experimental findings. We then apply the model to the TI. We are able to 
reproduce the principle features of both the direct and indirect TI with the model. 
2 PRINCIPLES OF CORTICAL OPERATION 
Recent work with voltage-sensitive dyes (Blasdel, 1992) augments the early work of 
Hubel  Wiesel (1962) which indicated that clusters of cortical neurons correspond- 
ing to cortical columns have similar orientation preferences. An examination of local 
field potentials (Victor et al., 1994) which represent potentials averaged over corti- 
cal volumes containing many hundreds of cells show orientation preferences. These 
considerations suggest that the appropriate units for an analysis of orientation se- 
lectivity are the localized clusters of neurons preferring the same orientation. This 
choice of a population model immediately simplifies both analysis and computation 
with the model. For brevity we will refer to elements or edge detectors, however 
these are to be understood as referring to localized populations of neurons with a 
common orientation preference. We view the cortex as a lattice of hypercolumns, 
in which each hypercolumn comprises a continuum of iso-orientation patches dis- 
tinguished by their preferred orientation b. All space coordinates refer to distances 
between hypercolumn centers. The population model we adopt throughout this 
work is a simplified form of the Wilson-Cowan equations. 
2.1 LOCAL MODEL 
Our local model is a ring (b = -90�to + 90 �) of coupled iso-orientation patches and 
inhibitors with the following characteristics 
� Weakly tuned orientation biased inputs to V1. These may arise either from 
slight orientation biases of lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) neurons or from 
converging thalamocortical afferents 
� Sharply tuned (space constant 7.5 �) recurrent excitation between iso- 
orientation populations 
� Broadly tuned inhibition to all iso-orientation populations with a cut-off 
of inhibition interactions at between 45 � and 60 � separation 
The principle constraint is that of a critical balance between excitatory and in- 
hibitory currents. Recent theoretical studies (Tsodyks  Sejnowski 1995; Vreeswijk 
 Sompolinsky 1996) have focused on this condition as an explanation for certain 
features of the dynamics of natural neuronal assemblies. These features include the 
irregular temporal firing patterns of cortical neurons, the sensitivity of neuronal 
assemblies in vivo to small fluctuations in total synaptic input and the distribu- 
tion of firing rates in cortical networks which is markedly skewed towards low mean

rates. Vreeswijk & Sompolinsky demonstrate that such a balance emerges naturally 
in certain large networks of excitatory and inhibitory populations. We implement 
this critical balance by explicitly tuning the strength of connection weights between 
excitatory and inhibitory populations so that the system state is subcritical to a 
bifurcation point with respect to the relative strength of excitation/inhibition. 
2.2 HORIZONTAL CONNECTIONS 
We distinguish three potential patterns of horizontal connectivity 
� connections between edge detectors along an axis parallel to the detectors 
preferred orientation (visuotopic connection) 
� connections along an axis orthogonal to the detectors preferred orientation, 
with or without visuotopic connections 
� radially symmetric connection to all detectors of the same orientation in 
surrounding hypercolumns 
Recent experimental work in the tree shrew (Fitzpatrick et al., 1996) and prelim- 
inary work in the macaque (Blasdel, personal communication) indicate that vi- 
suotopic connection is the predominant pattern of long-range connectivity. This 
connectivity pattern allows for the following reduction in dimension of the problem 
for certain experimental conditions. 
Consider the following experiment. A particular hypercolumn designated the cen- 
ter is stimulated with a grating at orientation  resulting in a response from the 
b-edge detector. The region outside the receptive area of this hypercolumn (in the 
surround) is also stimulated with a grating at some uniform orientation q result- 
ing in responses from -edge detectors at each hypercolumn in the surround. In 
order to study the interactions between center and surround, then to first order ap- 
proximation only the center hypercolumn and interaction with the surround along 
the  visuotopic axis (defined by the center) and the  visuotopic axis (once again 
defined by the center) need be considered. In fact, except when  =  the effect 
of the center on the surround will be negligible in view of the modulatory nature 
of the horizontal connections detailed above. Thus we can reduce the problem (a 
priori three dimensional - one angle and two space dimensions) to two dimensions 
(one angle and one space dimension) with respect to a fixed center. This reduc- 
tion is the key to providing a simple analysis of complex neurophysiological and 
psychophysical data. 
3 RESULTS 
3.1 CENTER-SURROUND INTERACTIONS 
Although, we have modeled the state-dependence of the horizontal connections, 
many of the center-surround experiments we wish to model have not taken this 
dependence explicitly into account. In general the surround has been found to 
be suppresslye on the center, which accords with the fact that the center is usually 
stimulated with high contrast stimuli. A typical example of the surround suppressive 
effect is shown in figure 1. 
The basic finding is that stimulation in the surround of a visual cortical cell's re- 
ceptive field generally results in a suppression of the cell's tuning response that 
is maximal for surround stimulation at the orientation of the cell's peak tuning

response and falls off with stimulation at other orientations in a characteristic man- 
ner. Further examples of surround suppression can be found in the paper of Sillito 
et al. (1995). Figure 2 depicts simulations in which long-range connections to lo- 
cal inhibitory populations are strong compared to connections to local excitatory 
populations. 
These experiments and simulations appear to conflict with the consistent experimen- 
tal finding that stimulating a hypercolumn with an orthogonal stimulus suppresses 
the response to the original stimulus. 
The relevant results can be summarised as follows: cross-orientation suppression 
(with orthogonal gratings) originates within the receptive field of most cells exam- 
ined and is a consistent finding in both complex and simple cells. The degree of 
suppression depends linearly on the size of the orthogonal grating up to a critical 
dimension which is smaller than the classical receptive field dimension. It is possible 
to suppress a response to the baseline firing rate by either increasing the size or the 
contrast of the orthogonal grating.
