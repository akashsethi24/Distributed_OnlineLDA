Abstract 
An novel class of locally excitatory, globally inhibitory oscillator 
networks is proposed. The model of each oscillator corresponds to a 
standard relaxation oscillator with two time scales. The network 
exhibits a mechanism of selective gating, whereby an oscillator 
jumping up to its active phase rapidly recruits the oscillators stimulated 
by the same pattern, while preventing others from jumping up. We 
show analytically that with the selective gating mechanism the network 
rapidly achieves both synchronization within blocks of oscillators that 
are stimulated by connected regions and desynchronization between 
different blocks. Computer simulations demonstrate the network's 
promising ability for segmenting multiple input patterns in real time. 
This model lays a physical foundation for the oscillatory correlation 
theory of feature binding, and may provide an effective computational 
framework for scene segmentation and figure/ground segregation. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
A basic attribute of perception is its ability to group elements of a perceived scene into 
coherent clusters (objects). This ability underlies perceptual processes such as 
figure/ground segregation, identification of objects, and separation of different objects, and 
it is generally known as scene segmentation or perceptual organization. Despite the fact 
200 DeLiang Wang, David Terman 
that humans perform it with apparent ease, the general problem of scene segmentation 
remains unsolved in the engineering of sensory processing, such as computer vision and 
auditory processing. 
Fundamental to scene segmentation is the grouping of similar sensory features and the 
segregation of dissimilar ones. Theoretical investigations of brain functions and feature 
binding point to the mechanism of temporal correlation as a representational framework 
(von der Malsburg, 1981; von der Malsburg and Schneider, 1986). In particular, the 
correlation theory of von der Malsburg (1981) asserts that an object is represented by the 
temporal correlation of the firing activities of the scattered cells coding different features 
of the object. A natural way of encoding temporal correlation is to use neural 
oscillations, whereby each oscillator encodes some feature (maybe just a pixel) of an 
object. In this scheme, each segment (object) is represented by a group of oscillators that 
shows synchrony (phase-locking) of the oscillations, and different objects are represented 
by different groups whose oscillations are desynchronized from each other. Let us refer to 
this form of temporal correlation as oscillatory correlation. The theory of oscillatory 
correlation has received direct experimental support from the cell recordings in the cat 
visual cortex (Eckhorn et al., 1988; Gray et al., 1989) and other brain regions. The 
discovery of synchronous oscillations in the visual cortex has triggered much interest 
from the theoretical community in simulating the experimental results and in exploring 
oscillatory correlation to solve the problems of scene segmentation. While several 
demonstrate synchronization in a group of oscillators using local (lateral) connections 
(K6nig and Schillen, 1991; Somers and Kopell, 1993; Wang, 1993, 1995), most of these 
models rely on long range connections to achieve phase synchrony. It has been pointed 
out that local connections in reaching synchrony may play a fundamental role in scene 
segmentation since long-range connections would lead to indiscriminate segmentation 
(Sporns et al., 1991; Wang, 1993). 
There are two aspects in the theory of oscillatory correlation: (1) synchronization within 
the same object; and (2) desynchronization between different objects. Despite intensive 
studies on the subject, the question of desynchronization has been hardly addressed. The 
lack of an efficient mechanism for desynchronization greatly limits the utility of 
oscillatory correlation to perceptual organization. In this paper, we propose a new class 
of oscillatory networks and show that it can rapidly achieve both synchronization within 
each object and alesynchronization between a number of simultaneously presented objects. 
The network is composed of the following elements: (1) A new model of a basic 
oscillator; (2) Local excitatory connections to produce phase synchrony within each 
object; (3) A global inhibitor that receives inputs from the entire network and feeds back 
with inhibition to produce desynchronization of the oscillator groups representing 
different objects. In other words, the mechanism of the network consists of local 
cooperation and global competition. This surprisingly simple neural architecture may 
provide an elementary approach to scene segmentation and a computational framework for 
perceptual organization. 
2 MODEL DESCRIPTION 
The building block of this network, a single oscillator i, is defined in the simplest form 
as a feedback loop between an excitatory unit x i and an inhibitory unit Yi:

where p denotes the amplitude of a Gaussian noise term. I i represents external 
stimulation to the oscillator, and S i denotes coupling from other oscillators in the 
network. The noise term is introduced both to test the robustness of the system and to 
actively desynchronize different input patterns. The parameter e is chosen to be small. 
In this case (1), without any coupling or noise, corresponds to a standard relaxation 
oscillator. The x-nullcline of (1) is a cubic curve, while the y-nullcline is a sigmoid 
function, as shown in Fig. 1. If I > 0, these curves intersect along the middle branch of 
the cubic, and (1) is oscillatory. The periodic solution alternates between the silent and 
active phases of near steady state behavior. The parameter ?'is introduced to control the 
relative times that the solution spends in these two phases. If I < 0, then the nullclines 
of (1) intersect at a stable fixed point along the left branch of the cubic. In this case the 
system produces no oscillation. The oscillator model (1) may be interpreted as a model of 
spiking behavior of a single neuron, or a mean field approximation to a network of 
excitatory and inhibitory neurons. 
The network we study here in particular is two dimensional. However, the results can 
easily be extended to other dimensions. Each oscillator in the network is connected to 
only its four nearest neighbors, thus forming a 2-D grid. This is the simplest form of 
local connections. The global inhibitor receives excitation from each oscillator of the 
grid, and in turn inhibits each oscillator. This architecture is shown in Fig. 2. The 
intuitive reason why the network gives rise to scene segmentation is the following. 
When multiple connected objects are mapped onto the grid, local connectivity on the grid 
will group together the oscillators covered by each object. This grouping will be reflected

by phase synchrony within each object. The global inhibitor is introduced for 
desynchronizing the oscillatory responses to different objects. We assume that the 
coupling term $i in (1) is given by

soo(x, o) = 1+ exp[-K(x-O)] (3) 
where Wik is a connection (synaptic) weight from oscillator k to oscillator i, and N(i) is 
the set of the neighoring oscillators that connect to i. In this model, N(i) is the four 
immediate neighbors on the 2-D grid, except on the boundaries where N(O may be either 
2 or 3 immediate neighbors. 0 x is a threshold (see the sigmoid function of Eq. 3) above 
which an oscillator can affect its neighbors. W z (positive) is the weight of inhibition 
from the global inhibitor z, whose activity is defined as 
� z) (4) 
where croo = 0 if x i < Ozx for every oscillator, and croo = 1 if x i > Ozx for at least one 
oscillator i. Hence 0zx represents a threshold. If the activity of every oscillator is below 
this threshold, then the global inhibitor will not receive any input. In this case z --> 0 
and the oscillators will not receive any inhibition. If, on the other hand, the activity of at 
least one oscillator is above the threshold 0zx then, the global inhibitor will receive 
input. In this case z--> 1, and each oscillator feels inhibition when z is above the 
threshold zx' The parameter q determines the rate at which the inhibitor reacts to such 
stimulation. 
In summary, once an oscillator is active, it triggers the global inhibitor. This then 
inhibits the entire network as described in Eq. 1. On the other hand, an active oscillator 
spreads its activation to its nearest neighbors, again through (1), and from them to its 
further neighbors. In the next section, we give a number of properties of this system. 
Besides boundaries, the oscillators on the grid are basically symmetrical. Boundary 
conditions may cause certain distortions to the stability of synchrous oscillations. 
Recently, Wang (1993) proposed a mechanism called dynamic normalization to ensure 
that each oscillator, whether it is in the interior or o
