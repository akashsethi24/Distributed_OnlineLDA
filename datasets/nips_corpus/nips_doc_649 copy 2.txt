Abstract 
A switching between apparently coherent (oscillatory) and stochastic 
episodes of activity has been observed in responses from cat and monkey 
visual cortex. We describe the dynamics of these phenomena in two paral- 
lel approaches, a phenomenological and a rather microscopic one. On the 
one hand we analyze neuronal responses in terms of a hidden state model 
(HSM). The parameters of this model are extracted directly from exper- 
imental spike trains. They characterize the underlying dynamics as well 
as the coupling of individual neurons to the network. This phenomenolog- 
ical model thus provides a new framework for the experimental analysis 
of network dynamics. The application of this method to multi unit ac- 
tivities from the visual cortex of the cat substantiates the existence of 
oscillatory and stochastic states and quantifies the switching behaviour 
in the assembly dynamics. On the other hand we start from the single 
spiking neuron and derive a master equation for the time evolution of the 
assembly state which we represent by a phase density. This phase density 
dynamics (PDD) exhibits costability of two attractors, a limit cycle, and 
a fixed point when synaptic interaction is nonlinear. External fluctuations 
can switch the bistable system from one state to the other. Finally we 
show, that the two approaches are mutually consistent and therefore both 
explain the detailed time structure in the data.

I INTRODUCTION 
A few years ago, oscillatory and synchronous neuronal activity was discovered in 
cat visual cortex [1-3]. These experiments backed earlier considerations about syn- 
chrony in neuronal activity as a mechanism to bind features, e.g., of an object in a 
visual scene [4]. They triggered broad experimental and theoretical investigations 
of detailed neuronal dynamics as a means for information processing and, in par- 
ticular, for feature binding. Many theoretical contributions tried to reproduce and 
explain aspects of the experimentally observed phenomena [5]. Motivated by the 
experiments, the models where particularly designed to exhibit spatial synchroniza- 
tion of permanent oscillatory responses upon stimulation by a common, connected 
stimulus like a bar. Most models consist of elements which exhibit a limit cycle 
after a simple Hopf bifurcation. 
The experimental data, however, contain many details which the present models do 
not yet completely incorporate. One of these details is the coexistence of regular 
and irregular episodes in the data, which interchange in an apparently stochastic 
manner. This interchange can be observed in the signals from a single electrode [6] 
as well as in the time-resolved correlation of the signals from two electrodes [7]. In 
this contribution we show, that the observed time structure reflects a switching in 
the dynamics of the underlying neuronal system. This will be demonstrated by two 
complementary approaches: 
On the one hand we present a new method for a quantitative analysis of the dynam- 
ical system underlying the measured spike trains. Our approach gives a quantitative 
description of the dynamical phenomena and furthermore explains the relation be- 
tween the collective excitation in the network which is not accessible experimentally 
(i.e. hidden) and the contributions of the single observed neurons in terms of transi- 
tion probability functions. These probabilities are the parameters of our Ansatz and 
can be estimated directly from multi unit activities (MUA) using the Baum-Welch- 
algorithm. Especially for the data from cat visual cortex we find that indeed there 
are two states dominating the dynamics of collective excitation, namely a state of 
repeated excitation and a state in which the observed neurons fire independently 
and stochastically. 
On the other hand using simple statistical considerations we derive a description 
for a local neuronal subpopulation which exhibits bistability. The dynamics of 
the subpopulation can either rest on a fixed point - corresponding to the irregular 
firing patterns - or can follow a limit cycle - corresponding to the oscillatory firing 
patterns. The subpopulation can alternate between both states under the influence 
of noise in the external excitation. It turns out that the dynamics of this formal 
model reproduces the observed local cortical signals in much detail. 
2 Excitability of Neurons and Neuronal Assemblies 
An abstract model of a neuron under external excitation e is given by its threshold 
dynamics. The state of the neuron is represented by its phase s, which is the 
time passed by since the last action potential (s = 0). The threshold t3 is high 
directly after a spike and falls off in time and the neuron can fire again when e 
exceeds t3. In case of noise or internal stochasticity, an excitability description of

the dynamics of the neuron is more adequate. It gives the probability PI to fire 
again in dependence of the state q5  with Pl(q5 ) = or(e- �(qSs)) and cr some sigmoid 
function. A monotonously falling threshold � then corresponds to a monotonously 
increasing excitability PI' Such a description neglects any memory in the neuron 
going beyond the last spike. In particular this means for an isolated neuron, that 
PI can be easily calculated from the inter-spike interval histogram (ISIH) Ph using 
the relation Ph(t) = Pl(t). (1 - fJ Pn(tt)dt'). In that case also the autocorrelation 
function can be calculated from Pn(t) via ((r) = Pn(r) + f Pn(r)((r- t)dt. 
The excitability formulation sketched above is not valid for a neuron which is em- 
bedded in a neuronal assembly. However, we may use this Ansatz of a renewal 
process to describe the activation dynamics of the whole assembly (see section 5). 
The phase q5 b = 0 here corresponds to the state of synchronous activity of many 
neurons in the assembly, which we call burst for convenience. Since the dynamics 
of the network can differ from the dynamics of the elements we expect the func- 
tion P}(q5 b) which now describes the burst excitability of the whole assembly to be 
different from,the spike excitability Pl(qSs) of the single neuron. 
A simple example for this is a system of integrate and fire neurons in which os- 
ciliatory and irregular phases emerge under fixed stimulus conditions([8, 9] and 
section 5). Contrary to the excitability of the single refractory element the burst 
excitability P) of the system has a maximum at q5 b = T which expresses the in- 
creased probability to burst again after the typical oscillation period T, i.e. the 
maximum represents a state o of oscillation. The assembly, however, can miss to 
burst around q5  = T with a probability Po--, and switch into a second state s 
in which the probability P,--,o to burst again is reduced to a constant level. The 
switching probabilities Po--, and P,--,o can be easily calculated from P). In this 
way the shape of P) distinguishes a system with an oscillatory state from a system 
which is purely refractory but which nevertheless can still have strong modulations 
in the autocorrelogram [13]. 
3 Hidden states and stochastic observables 
The single neuron in an assembly, however, need not be strictly coupled to the state 
of the assembly, i.e. a neuron may also spike for qb > 0 and it may not take part 
in a burst. This stochastic coupling to an underlying process suffices to destroy 
the equivalence of Ph and the autocorrelogram C(r) =< s(t)s(t + r) >t of the 
spike train s(t)  {0, 1} (Fig 1). We therefore include the probability Po,(c) ) to 
observe a spike when the assembly is in the state q5  into our description (Fig. 2). 
The unlikely case where the spike represents the burst corresponds to the choice 
Pob = 6b,o. 
4 Application to Experimental Data 
While our approach is quite general, we here concentrate on the measurements 
of Gray et al. [2] in cat visual cortex. Because our hidden state model has the 
structure of a hidden Markov model we can obtain all the parameters Pood(c)) and

peak around the main period at T = 19ms, which indicates a state of oscillation. 
For larger phases we see a reduced excitability which reveals a state of stochastic 
activity (Pob,(q5  > T) > 0). The spike observation probability Po,(q5) is peaked 
near the burst and is about constant elsewhere. This means that we can characterize 
the data by a stochastic switching between two dynamical states in the underlying 
system. Because of the stochastic coupling of the sing
