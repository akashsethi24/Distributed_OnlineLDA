Abstract 
This paper deals with an application of Neural Networks to satellite 
remote sensing observations. Because of the complexity of the 
application and the large amount of data, the problem cannot be solved 
by using a single method. The solution we propose is to build multi- 
modules NN architectures where several NN cooperate together. Such 
system suffer from generic problem for whom we propose solutions. 
They allow to reach accurate performances for multi-valued function 
approximations and probability estimations. The results are compared 
with six other methods which have been used for this problem. We 
show that the methodology we have developed is general and can be 
used for a large variety of applications.

1 INTRODUCTION 
Neural Networks have been used for many years to solve hard real world applications 
which involve large amounts of data. Most of the time, these problems cannot be solved 
with a unique technique and involve successive processing of the input data. 
Sophisticated NN architectures have thus been designed to provide good performances e.g. 
[Lecun et al. 90]. However this approach is limited for many reasons: the design of 
these architectures requires a lot of a priori knowledge about the task and is complicated. 
Such NN are difficult to train because of their large size and are dedicated to a specific 
problem. Moreover if the task is slightly modified, these NN have to be entirely 
redesigned and retrained. It is our feeling that complex problems cannot be solved 
efficiently with a single NN whatever sophisticated it is. A more fruitful approach is to 
use modular architectures where several simple NN modules cooperate together. This 
methodology is far more general and allows to easily build very sophisticated architectures 
which are able to handle the different processing steps which are necessary for example in 
speech or signal processing. These architectures can be easily modified to incorporate 
some additional knowledge about the problem or some changes in its specifications. 
We have used these ideas to build a multi-module NN for a satellite remote sensing 
application. This is a hard problem which cannot be solved by a single NN. The 
different modules of our architecture are thus dedicated to specific tasks and allow to 
perform successive processing of the data. This approach allows to take into account in 
successive steps different informations about the problem. Furthermore, errors which 
may occur at the output of some modules may be corrected by others which allows to 
reach very good performances. Making these different modules cooperate raises several 
problems which appear to be generic for these architectures. It is thus interesting to study 
different solutions for their design, training, and the efficient information exchanges 
between modules. In the present paper, we first briefly describe the geophysical problem 
and its difficulties, we then present the different modules of our architecture and their 
cooperation, we compare our results to those of several other methods and discuss the 
advantages of our method. 
2 THE GEOPHYSICAL PROBLEM 
Scatterometers are active microwave radars which accurately measure the power of 
transmitted and backscatter signal radiations in order to compute the normalized radar cross 
section (c0) of the ocean surface. The c 0 depends on the wind speed, the incidence angle 0 
(which is the angle between the radar beam and the vertical at the illuminated cell) and the 
azimuth angle (which is the horizontal angle Z between the wind and the antenna of the 
radar). The empirically based relationship between c;0 and the local wind vector can be 
established which leads to the determination of a geophysical model function. 
The model developed by A. Long gives a more precise form to this functional. It has 
been shown that for an angle of incidence 0, the general expression for c0 can be 
satisfactorily represented by a Fourrier series:

with U = A.v

Long's model specifies that A and /only depend on the angle of incidence 0, and that b 1 
and b 2 are a function of both the wind speed v and the angle of incidence 0 (Figure 1).

For now, the different parameters bl, b2 A and � used in this model are determined 
experimentally. 
Conversely it becomes possible to compute the wind direction by using several antenna 
with different orientations with respect to the satellite track. The geophysical model 
function (1) can then be inverted using the three measurements of c0 given by the three 
antennas, it computes wind vector (direction and speed). Evidence shows that for a given 
trajectory within the swath (Figure 1) i.e. (01,02,03) fixed, 0 i being the incidence angle of 
the beam linked to antenna i, the functional F is of the form presented in Fig.2 . 
In the absence of noise, the determination of the wind direction would be unique in most 
cases. Noise-free ambiguities arise due to the bi-harmonic nature of the model function 
with respect to Z- The functional F presents singular points. At constant wind speed F 
yields a Lissajous curve; in the singular points the direction is ambiguous with respect 
to the triplet measurements ((Jl,(J2,(J3) as it is seen in Fig. 2. At these points F yields 
two directions differing by 160 �. In practice, since the backscatter signal is noisy the 
number and the frequency of ambiguities is increased.

The problem is therefore how to set up an accurate (exact) wind map using the observed 
measurements (0,02,03). 
3 THE METHOD 
We propose to use multi-layered quasi-linear networks (MLP) to carry out this inversion 
phase. Indeed these nets are able of approximate complex non-linear functional relations; 
it becomes possible by using a set of measurements to determine F and to realize the 
inversion. 
The determination of the wind's speed and direction lead to two problems of different 
complexity, each of them is solved using a dedicated multi-modular system. The two 
modules are then linked together to build a two level architecture. To take into account 
the strong dependence of the measurements with respect to the trajectory, each module (or 
level ) consists of n distinct but similar systems, a specific system being dedicated to each 
satellite trajectory (n being the number of trajectories in a swath (Figure 1)). 
The first level will allow the determination of the wind speed at every point of the swath. 
The results obtained will then be supplied to the second level as supplementary data 
which allow to compute the wind direction. Thus, we propose a two-level architecture 
which constitutes an automatic method for the computation of wind maps (Figure 3). 
The computation is performed sequentially between the different levels, each one 
supplying the next with the parameters needed. 
Owing to the space variability of the wind, the measurements at a point are closely related 
to those performed in the neighbourhood. Taking into account this context must 
therefore bring important supplementary information to dealiase the ambiguities. At a 
point, the input data for a given system are therefore the measurements observed at that 
point and at it's eight closest neighbours. 
All the networks used by the different systems are MLP trained with the back-propagation 
algorithm. The successive modifications were performed using a second order Stochastic 
gradient: which is the approximation of the Levenberg-Marquardt rule.

One system is dedicated to a proper trajectory. As a result the networks used on the same 
level of the global architecture are of the same type; only the learning set numerical 
values change from one system to another. Each network learning set will therefore 
consist of the data mesured on its trajectory. We present here the results for the central 
trajectory, performances for the others are similar. 
3.1 THE NETWORK DECODING : FIRST LEVEL 
A system (S1) in the first level allows to compute the wind speed (in ms -1) along a 
trajectory. Because the function F 1 to be learned (signal - wind speed) is highly non- 
linear, each system is made of three networks (see Figure 3): R1 allows to decide the 
range of the wind speed (4 <_ v < 12 or 12 < v < 20); according to the R1 output an 
accurate value is computed using R2 for the first range and R3 for the other. The first 
level is built from 10 of these systems (one for each trajectory). 
Each network (R1, R2, R3) consists of four fully connected layers. For a given point, we 
have introduced the knowledge of the radar measurements at the neighbouring points. The
