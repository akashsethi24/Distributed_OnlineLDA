Abstract 
Stochastic fluctuations of voltage-gated ion channels generate current 
and voltage noise in neuronal membranes. This noise may be a criti- 
cal determinant of the efficacy of information processing within neural 
systems. Using Monte-Carlo simulations, we carry out a systematic in- 
vestigation of the relationship between channel kinetics and the result- 
ing membrane voltage noise using a stochastic Markov version of the 
Mainen-Sejnowski model of dendritic excitability in cortical neurons. 
Our simulations show that kinetic parameters which lead to an increase 
in membrane excitability (increasing channel densities, decreasing tem- 
perature) also lead to an increase in the magnitude of the sub-threshold 
voltage noise. Noise also increases as the membrane is depolarized from 
rest towards threshold. This suggests that channel fluctuations may in- 
terfere with a neuron's ability to function as an integrator of its synaptic 
inputs and may limit the reliability and precision of neural information 
processing. 
1 Introduction 
Voltage-gated ion channels undergo random transitions between different conformational 
states due to thermal agitation. Generally, these states differ in their ionic permeabilities 
and the stochastic transitions between them give rise to conductance fluctuations which 
are a source of membrane noise [1]. In excitable cells, voltage-gated channel noise can 
contribute to the generation of spontaneous action potentials [2, 3], and the variability of 
spike timing [4]. Channel fluctuations can also give rise to bursting and chaotic spiking 
dynamics in neurons [5, 6]. 
Our interest in studying membrane noise is based on the thesis that noise ultimately limits 
the ability of neurons to transmit and process information. To study this problem, we com- 
bine methods from information theory, membrane biophysics and compartmental neuronal 
modeling to evaluate ability of different biophysical components of a neuron, such as the 
synapse, the dendritic tree, the soma and so on, to transmit information [7, 8, 9]. These 
neuronal components differ in the type, density, and kinetic properties of their constituent 
ion channels. Thus, measuring the impact of these differences on membrane noise rep-

resents a fundamental step in our overall program of evaluating information transmission 
within and between neurons. 
Although information in the nervous system is mostly communicated in the form of action 
potentials, we first direct our attention to the study of sub-threshold voltage fluctuations for 
three reasons. Firstly, voltage fluctuations near threshold can cause variability in spike tim- 
ing and thus directly influence the reliability and precision of neuronal activity. Secondly, 
many computations putatively performed in the dendritic tree (coincidence detection, mul- 
tiplication, synaptic integration and so on) occur in the sub-threshold regime and thus are 
likely to be influenced by sub-threshold voltage noise. Lastly, several sensory neurons in 
vertebrates and invertebrates are non-spiking and an analysis of voltage fluctuations can be 
used to study information processing in these systems as well. 
Extensive investigations of channel noise were carried out prior to the advent of the patch- 
clamp technique in order to provide indirect evidence for the existence of single ion chan- 
nels (see [ 1 ] for an excellent review). More recently, theoretical studies have focused on the 
effect of random channel fluctuations on spike timing and reliability of individual neurons 
[4], as well as their effect on the dynamics of interconnected networks of neurons [5, 6]. 
In this paper, we determine the effect of varying the kinetic parameters, such as channel 
density and the rate of channel transitions, on the magnitude of sub-threshold voltage noise 
in an iso-potential membrane patches containing stochastic voltage-gated ion channels us- 
ing Monte-Carlo simulations. The simulations are based on the Mainen-Sejnowski (MS) 
kinetic model of active channels in the dendrites of cortical pyramidal neurons [10]. By 
varying two model parameters (channel densities and temperature), we investigate the rela- 
tionship between excitability and noise in neuronal membranes. By linearizing the channel 
kinetics, we derive analytical expressions which provide closed-form estimates of noise 
magnitudes; we contrast the results of the simulations with the linearized expressions to 
determine the parameter range over which they can be used. 
2 Monte-Carlo Simulations 
Consider an iso-potential membrane patch containing voltage-gated K + and Na+channels 
and leak channels, 
--7 dVm 
dt = gE (V - EE) + gN (V - ENd) + g� (V - E�) + hn (1) 
where C is the membrane capacitance and #K (gNa, gL) and EK (JNa, EL) denote the 
K + (Na + , leak) conductance and the K + (Na +, leak) reversal potential respectively. Current 
injected into the patch is denoted by Ira j, with the convention that inward current is nega- 
tive. The channels which give rise to potassium and sodium conductances switch randomly 
between different conformational states with voltage-dependent transition rates. Thus, #K 
and #va are voltage-dependent random processes and eq. 1 is a non-linear stochastic differ- 
ential equation. Generally, ion channel transitions are assumed to be Markovian [11] and 
the stochastic dynamics of eq. 1 can be studied using Monte-Carlo simulations of finite- 
state Markov models of channel kinetics. 
Earlier studies have carried out simulations of stochastic versions of the classical Hodgkin- 
Huxley kinetic model [12] to study the effect of conductance fluctuations on neuronal 
spiking [13, 2, 4]. Since we are interested in sub-threshold voltage noise, we consider 
a stochastic Markov version of a less excitable kinetic model used to describe dendrites of 
cortical neurons [10]. We shall refer to it as the Mainen-Sejnowski (MS) kinetic scheme. 
The K+ conductance is modeled by a single activation sub-unit (denoted by n) whereas 
the Na+conductance is comprised of three identical activation sub-units (denoted by m) 
and one inactivation sub-unit (denoted by/). Thus, the stochastic discrete-state Markov 
models of the K+and Na+channel have 2 and 8 states respectively (shown in Fig. 1). The

by (7K,7Na) and (r/K,r/va) respectively. Thus, gx and gv) are given by the products of 
the respective single channel conductances and the corresponding numbers of channels in 
the conducting states.

We performed Monte-Carlo simulations 
of the MS kinetic scheme using a fixed 
time step of At = 10 ttsec. During each 
step, the number of sub-units undergo- 
ing transitions between states i and j 
was determined by drawing a pseudo- 
random binomial deviate (bnldov sub- 
routine [14] driven by the ran2 subrou- 
tine of the 2 nd edition) with N equal 
to the number of sub-units in state i 
and p given by the conditional proba- 
bility of the transition between i and j. 
After updating the number of channels 
in each state, eq. 1 was integrated us- 
ing fourth order Runge-Kutta integration 
with adaptive step size control [ 14]. Dur- 
ing each step, the channel conductances 
new numbers of open channels. (See [4] 
Due to random channel transitions, the 
membrane voltage fluctuates around the 
steady-state resting membrane voltage 
Vrest. By varying the magnitude of 
the constant injected current Iinj, the 
steady-state voltage can be varied over a 
broad range, which depends on the chan- 
nel densities. The current required to 
maintain the membrane at a holding volt- 
age Vhota can be determined from the 
steady-state I-V curve of the system, as 
shown in Fig. 2. Voltages for which 
the slope of the I-V curve is negative 
cannot be maintained as steady-states. 
By injecting an external current to offset 
the total membrane current, a fixed point 
in the negative slope region can be ob- 
tained but since the fixed point is unsta- 
ble, any perturbation, such as a stochastic 
ion channel opening or closing, causes 
the system to be driven to the closest sta- 
ble fixed point. We measured sub-threshold voltage noise only for stable steady-state hold- 
ing voltages. A typical voltage trace from our simulations is shown in Fig. 3. To estimate 
the standard deviation of the voltage noise accurately, simulations were performed for a 
total of 492 seconds, divided into 60 blocks of 8.2 seconds each, for each steady-state 
value.
