ABSTRACT 
The brain represents the skin surface as a topographic map in the 
somatosensory cortex. This map has been shown experimentally to 
be modifiable in a use-dependent fashion throughout life. We 
present a neural network simulation of the competitive dynamics 
underlying this cortical plasticity by detailed analysis of receptive 
field properties of model neurons during simulations of skin co- 
activation, cortical lesion, digit amputation and nerve section. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
Plasticity of adult somatosensory cortical maps has been demonstrated experimentally 
in a variety of maps and species (Kass, et al., 1983; Wall, 1988). This report focuses 
on modelling primary somatosensory cortical plasticity in the adult monkey. 
We model the long-term consequences of four specific experiments, taken in pairs. 
With the first pair, behaviorally controlled stimulation of restricted skin surfaces (Jen- 
kins, et al., 1990) and induced cortical lesions (Jenkins and Merzenich, 1987), we 
demonstrate that Hebbian-type dynamics is sufficient to account for the inverse rela- 
tionship between cortical magnification (area of conical map representing a unit area 
of skin) and receptive field size (skin surface which when stimulated excites a cortical 
unit) (Sur, et al., 1980; Grajski and Merzenich, 1990). These results are obtained with 
several variations of the basic model. We conclude that relying solely on cortical 
magnification and receptive field size will not disambiguate the contributions of each 
of the myriad circuits known to occur in the brain. With the second pair, digit ampu- 
tation (Merzenich, et al., 1984) and peripheral nerve cut (without regeneration) (Mer- 
zenich, ï¿½t al., 1983), we explore the role of local excitatory connections in the model

cortex (Grajski, submitted ). 
Previous models have focused on the self-organization of topographic maps in general 
(Willshaw and von der Malsburg, 1976; Takeuchi and Amari, 1979; Kohonen, 1982; 
among others). Ritter and Schulten (1986) specifically addressed somatosensory plas- 
ticity using a variant of Kohonen's self-organizing mapping. Recently, Pearson, et al., 
(1987), using the framework of the Group Selection Hypothesis, have also modelled 
aspects of normal and reorganized somatosensory plasticity. 
Elements of the present study have been published elsewhere (Grajski and Merzenich, 
1990). 
2 THE MODEL 
2.1 ARCHITECTURE 
The network consists of three heirarchically organized two-dimensional layers shown 
in Figure 1A.

Figure 1: Network architecture. 
The divergence of projections from a single skin site to subcortex (SC) and its subse- 
quent projection to cortex (C) is shown at left: Skin (S) to SC, 5 x 5; SC to C, 7 x 7. 
S is partitioned into three 15 x 5 digits Left, Center and Right. The standard S 
stimulus used in all simulations is shown lying on digit Left. The projection from C 
to SC E and I cells is shown at right. Each node in the SC and C layers contains an 
excitatory (E) and inhibitory cell (I) as shown in Figure lB. In C, each E cell forms 
excitatory connections with a 5 x 5 patch of I cells; each I cell forms inhibitory con- 
54 Grajski and Merzenich 
nextions with a 7 x 7 path of E cells. In SC, these connections are 3 x 3 and 5 x 5, 
respectively. In addition, in C only, E cells form excitatory connections with a 5 by 5 
patch of E cells. The spatial relationship of E and I cell projections for the central 
node is shown at left (C E to E shown in light gray, C I to E shown in black). 
2.2 DYNAMICS 
The model neuron is the same for all E and I cells: an RC-time constant membrane 
which is alepolarized and (additively) hyperpolarized by linearly weighted connections:

u/x,r - membrane potential for unit i of type Y on layer X; v/x'r - firing rate for unit i 
of type Y on layer X;  - skin units are OFF (=0) or ON (=1); x,,, - membrane time 
constant (with respect to unit time); w,7 st(xe):p*0rr) - connection to unit i of post- 
synaptic type y on postsynaptic layer x from units of presynaptic type Y on presynap- 
tic layer X. Each summation term is normalized by the number of incoming connec- 
tions (corrected for planar boundary conditions) contributing to the term. Each unit 
converts membrane potential to a continuous-valued output value v via a sigmoidal 
function representing an average firing rate (13 = 4.0): 
vi = g (ui ) = 
1 1

2.3 SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY 
Synaptic strength is modified in three ways: a.) activity-dependent change; b.) passive 
decay; and c.) normalization. Activity-dependent and passive decay terms are as fol- 
lows: 
Aw O = '-'syn wij + otvi vj 
w O - connection from cell j to cell i; xo,,---0.01x,=0.005 - time constant for passive 
synaptic decay; cw-0.05, the maximum activity-dependent step change; vj,vi - pre- and 
post-synaptic output values, respectively. Further modification occurs by a multiplica- 
tive normalization performed over the incoming connections for each cell. The nor- 
malization is such that the summed total strength of incoming connections is R:

N i - number of incoming connections for cell i; w 0 - connection from cell j to cell i; 
R = 2.0 - the total resource available to cell i for redistribution over its incoming con- 
nections. 
2.4 
MEASURING CORTICAL MAGNIFICATION, RECEPTIVE FIELD 
AREA 
Cortical magnification is measured by mapping the network, e.g., noting which 3x3 
skin patch most strongly drives each cortical E cell. The number of cortical nodes 
driven maximally by the same skin site is the cortical magnification for that skin site. 
Receptive field size for a C (SC) layer E cell is estimated by stimulating all possible 
3x3 skin patches (169) and noting the peak response. Receptive field size is defined as 
the number of 3x3 skin patches which drive the unit at >50% of its peak response. 
3 SIMULATIONS 
3.1 FORMATION OF THE TOPOGRAPHIC MAP ENTAILS REFINEMENT 
OF SYNAPTIC PATTERNING 
The location of individual connections is fixed by topographic projection; initial 
strengths are drawn from a Gaussian distribution (Ix = 2.0, 2 = 0.2). Stand_ard-sized 
skin patches are stimulated in random sequence with no double-digit stimulation. 
(Mapping includes tests for double-digit receptive fields.) For each patch, the network 
is allowed to reach steady-state while the plasticity rule is ON. Synaptic strengths are 
then renormalized. Refinement continues until two conditions are met: a.) fewer than 
5% of all E cells change their receptive field location; and b.) receptive field areas (us- 
ing the 50% criterion) change by no more than +1 unit area for 95% of E cells. (See 
Figures 2 and 3 in Merzenich and Grajski, 1990; Grajski, submitted ). 
3.2 RESTRICTED SKIN STIMULATION GIVES INCREASED MAGNIFICA- 
TION, DECREASED RECEPTIVE FIELD SIZE 
Jenkins, et al., (1990) describe a behavioral experiment which leads to cortical soma- 
totopic reorganization. Monkeys are trained to maintain contact with a rotating disk 
situated such that only the tips of one or two of their longest digits are stimulated. 
Monkeys are required to maintain this contact for a specified period of time in order 
to receive food reward. Comparison of pre- and post-stimulation maps (or the latter 
with maps obtained after varying periods without disk stimulation) reveal up to nearly 
3-fold differences in cortical magnification and reduction in receptive field size for 
stimulated skin. 
We simulate the above experiment by extending the refinement process described 
above, but with the probability of stimulating a restricted skin region increased 5:1. 
(See Grajski and Merzenich (1990), Figure 4.) Figure 2 illustrates the change in size 
(left) and synaptic patterning (right) for a single representative cortical receptive field.

3.3 AN INDUCED, FOCAL CORTICAL LESIONS GIVES DECREASED 
MAGNIFICATION, INCREASED RECEPTIVE FIELD SIZE 
The inverse magnification rule predicts that a decrease in cortical magnification is ac- 
companied by an increase in receptive field areas. Jenkins, et al., (1987) confirmed 
this hypothesis by inducing focal cortical lesions in the representation of restricted 
hand surfaces, e.g. a single digit. Changes included: a.) a re-emergence of a represen- 
tation of the skin formerly represented in the now lesioned zone in the intact surround- 
ing cortex; b.) the new representation is at the expense of cortical magnification of 
skin originally represented in those regions; so that c.) large regions of the map con- 
tain neurons with abnormally large receptive fields. 
We simulate this experiment by eliminating the incoming and outgoing connections of 
the cortical layer region representing the middle digit. The refinement process 
described above is continued under these new conditions until topographic map and 
receptive field size measures converge. The re-emergence of represe
