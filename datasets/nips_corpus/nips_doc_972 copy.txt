Abstract 
Accumulating data from neurophysiology and neuropsychology 
have suggested two information processing roles for prefrontal cor- 
tex (PFC): 1) short-term active memory; and 2) inhibition. We 
present a new behavioral task and a computational model which 
were developed in parallel. The task was developed to probe both 
of these prefrontal functions simultaneously, and produces a rich 
set of behavioral data that act as constraints on the model. The 
model is implemented in continuous-time, thus providing a natural 
framework in which to study the temporal dynamics of processing 
in the task. We show how the model can be used to examine the be- 
havioral consequences of neuromodulation in PFC. Specifically, we 
use the model to make novel and testable predictions regarding the 
behavioral performance of schizophrenics, who are hypothesized to 
suffer from reduced dopaminergic tone in this brain area. 
I Introduction 
Prefrontal cortex (PFC) is an area of the human brain which is significantly ex- 
panded relative to other animals. There is general consensus that the PFC is cen- 
trally involved in higher cognitive activities such as planning, problem solving and 
language. Recently, the PFC has been associated with two specific information pro- 
cessing mechanisms: short-term active memory and inhibition. Active memory is 
the capacity of the nervous system to maintain information in the form of sustained 
activation states (e.g., cell firing) for short periods of time. This can be distin- 
guished from forms of memory that are longer in duration and are instantiated as

modified values of physiological parameters (e.g., synaptic strength). Over the last 
two decades, there have been a large number of neurophysiological studies focusing 
on the cellular basis of active memory in prefrontal cortex. These studies have re- 
vealed neurons in PFC that fire selectively to specific stimuli and response patterns, 
and that remain active during a delay between these. Investigators such as Fuster 
(1989) and Goldman-Rakic (1987) have argued from this data that PFC maintains 
temporary information needed to guide behavioral responses through sustained pat- 
terns of neural activity. This hypothesis is consistent with behavioral findings from 
both animal and human lesion studies, which suggest that PFC is required for tasks 
involving delayed responses to prior stimuli (Fuster, 1989; Stuss g Benson, 1986). 
In addition to its role in active memory, many investigators have focused on the 
inhibitory functions of PFC. It has been argued that PFC representations are re- 
quired to overcome reflexive or previously reinforced response tendencies in order 
to mediate a contextually appropriate - but otherwise weaker - response (Cohen &: 
Servan-Schreiber, 1992). Clinically, it has been observed that lesions to PFC are of- 
ten associated with a syndrome of behavioral disinhibition, in which patients act in 
impulsive and often socially inappropriate ways (Stuss &: Benson, 1986). This syn- 
drome has often been cited as evidence that PFC plays an important role inhibiting 
behaviors which are compelling but socially inappropriate. 
While the involvement of PFC in both active memory and inhibition is generally 
agreed upon, computational models can play an important role in providing mech- 
anisms by which to explain how these two information processing functions arise. 
There are several computational models now in the literature which have focused 
on either the active memory (Zipser, 1991), or inhibitory (Levine &: Pruiett, 1989) 
functions of PFC, or both functions together (Dehaene g Changeux, 1989; Co- 
hen &: Servan-Schreiber, 1992). These models have been instrumental in explaining 
the role of PFC in a variety of behavioral tasks (e.g., the Wisconsin Card Sort and 
Stroop). However, these earlier models are limited by their inability to fully cap- 
ture the dynamical processes underlying active memory and inhibition. Specifically, 
none of the simulations have been tightly constrained by the temporal parameters 
found in the behavioral tasks (e.g., durations of stimuli, delay periods, and response 
latencies). This limitation is not found solely in the models, but is also a feature of 
the behavioral tasks themselves. The tasks simulated were not structured in ways 
that could facilitate a dynamical analysis of processing. 
In this paper we address the limitations of the previous work by describing both a 
new behavioral task and a computational model of PFC. These have been developed 
in parallel and, together, provide a useful framework for exploring the temporal 
dynamics of active memory and inhibition and their consequences for behavior. We 
then go on to describe how this framework can be used to examine neuromodulatory 
effects in PFC, which are believed to play a critical role in both normal functioning 
and in psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia. 
2 Behavioral Assessment of Human PFC Function 
We have developed a task paradigm which incorporates two components central to 
the function of prefrontal cortex - short-term active memory and inhibition - and 
that can be used to study the dynamics of processing. The task is a variant of the 
continuous performance test (CPT), which is commonly used to study attention in

behavioral and clinical research. In a standard version of the task (the CPT-AX), 
letters are presented one at a time in the middle of a computer screen. Subjects are 
instructed to press the target button to the letter X (probe stimulus) but only when 
it is preceded by an A (the cue stimulus). In previous versions of the CPT, subjects 
only responded on target trials. In the present version of the task, a two response 
forced-choice procedure is employed; on non-A-X trials subjects are asked to press 
the non-target button. This procedure allows for response latencies to be evaluated 
on every trial, thus providing more information about the temporal dimensions of 
processing in the task. 
Two additional modifications were made to the standard paradigm in order to 
maximally engage PFC activity. The memory function of PFC is tapped by ma- 
nipulating the delay between stimuli. In the CPT-AX, the prior stimulus (cue or 
non-cue) provides the context necessary to decide how to respond to the probe let- 
ter. However, with a short delay (750 msec.), there is little demand on memory 
for the prior stimulus. This is supported by evidence that PFC lesions have been 
shown to have no effect on performance when there is only a short delay (Stuss & 
Benson, 1986). With a longer delay (5000 msec.), however, it becomes necessary to 
maintain a representation of the prior stimulus in order for it to be used as context 
for responding to the current one. The ability of the PFC to sustain contextual 
representations over the delay period can be determined behaviorally by comparing 
performance on short delay trials (50%) against those with long delays (50%). 
The inhibitory function of PFC is probed by introducing a prepotent response 
tendency that must be overcome to respond correctly. This tendency is introduced 
into the task by increasing the frequency of target trials (A followed by X). In the 
remaining trials, there are three types of distractors: 1) a cue followed by a non- 
target probe letter (e.g., A-Y); 2) a non-cue followed by the target probe letter (e.g., 
B-X); and a non-cue followed by a non-target probe letter (e.g., B-Y). Target trials 
occur 70% of the time, while each type of distractor trial occurs only 10% of the 
time. The frequency of targets promotes the development of a strong tendency to 
respond to the target probe letter whenever it occurs, regardless of the identity of 
the cue (since a response to the X itself is correct 7 out of 8 times). 
The ability to inhibit this response tendency can be examined by comparing accu- 
racy on trials when the target occurs in the absence of the cue (B-X trials), with 
those made when neither the cue nor target occurs (i.e., B-Y trials, which provide a 
measure of non-specific response bias and random responding). Trials in which the 
cue but not the target probe appears (A-Y trials) are also particularly interesting 
with respect to PFC function. These trials measure the cumulative influence of 
active representations of context in guiding responses. In a normally functioning 
system, context representations should stabilize and increase in strength as time 
progresses. Thus, it is expected that A-Y accuracy will tend to decrease for long 
delay trials relative to short ones. 
As mentioned above, the primary benefit of this paradigm is that it provides a 
framework in which to simultaneously probe the inhibitory and memory functions 
associated with PFC. This is supported by preliminary neuroimaging data from 
our laboratory (using PET) which suggests that PFC is, in fact, activated during 
performance of the task. Although it is simple in structure, the task also generates 
a rich set of behavioral data. There are four stimulus conditions crossed with two 
delay conditions for which both accuracy and reaction time performance can be
