Abstract 
We propose that the binding and segmentation of visual features 
is mediated by two complementary mechanisms; a low resolu- 
tion, spatial-based, resource-free process and a high resolution, 
temporal-based, resource-limited process. In the visual cortex, the 
former depends upon the orderly topographic organization in stri- 
ate and extrastriate areas while the latter may be related to ob- 
served temporal relationships between neuronal activities. Com- 
puter simulations illustrate the role the two mechanisms play in 
figure/ground discrimination, depth-from-occlusion, and the vivid- 
ness of perceptual completion. 
1 COMPLEMENTARY BINDING MECHANISMS 
The binding problem is a classic problem in computational neuroscience which 
considers how neuronal activities are grouped to create mental representations. For 
the case of visual processing, the binding of neuronal activities requires a mecha- 
nism for selectively grouping fragmented visual features in order to construct the 
coherent representations (i.e. objects) which we perceive. In this paper we argue for 
the existence of two complementary mechanisms for neural binding, and we show 
how such mechanisms may operate in the construction of intermediate-level visual 
representations.

Ordered cortical topography has been found in both striate and extrastriate areas 
and is believed to be a fundamental organizational principle of visual cortex. One 
functional role for this topographic mapping may be to facilitate a spatial-based 
binding system. For example, active neurons or neural populations within a cor- 
tical area could be grouped together based on topographic proximity while those 
in different areas could be grouped if they lie in rough topographic register. An 
advantage of this scheme is that it can be carried out in parallel across the visual 
field. However, a spatial-based mechanism will tend to bind overlapping or occluded 
objects which should otherwise be segmented. An alternative binding mechanism 
is therefore necessary for binding and segmenting overlapping objects and surfaces. 
Temporal binding is a second type of neural binding. Temporal binding differs 
from spatial binding in two essential ways; 1) it operates at high spatial resolutions 
and 2) it binds and segments in the temporal domain, allowing for the coexistence 
of multiple objects in the same topographic region. Others have proposed that 
temporal events, such as phase-locked firing or '7 oscillations may play a role in 
neural binding (yon der Malsburg, 1981; Gray and Singer, 1989, Crick and Koch, 
1990). For purposes of this discussion, we do not consider the specific nature of the 
temporal events underlying neural binding, only that the binding itself is temporally 
dependent. The disadvantage of operating in the temporal domain is that the 
biophysical properties of cortical neurons (e.g. membrane time constants) forces 
this processing to be resource-limited-only a small number of objects or surfaces 
can be bound and segmented simultaneously.

COMPUTING INTERMEDIATE-LEVEL VISUAL 
REPRESENTATIONS: DIRECTION OF FIGURE 
We consider how these two classes of binding can be used to compute context- 
dependent (non-local) characteristics about the visual scene. An example of a 
context-dependent scene characteristic is contour ownership or direction of figure. 
Direction of figure is a useful intermediate-level visual representation since it can 
be used to organize an image into a perceptual scene (e.g. infer relative depth and 
link segregated features). Figure 1A illustrates the relationship between contours 
and surfaces implied by direction of figure. 
We describe a model which utilizes both spatial and temporal binding to compute 
direction of figure (DOF). Prior to computing the DOF, the surface contours in 
the image are extracted. These contours are then temporally bound by a process 
we call contour binding (Finkel and Sajda, 1992). In the model, the temporal 
properties of the units are represented by a temporal binding value. We will not 
consider the details of this process except to say that units with similar temporal 
binding values are bound together while those with different values are segmented. 
In vivo, this temporal binding value may be represented by phase of neural firing, 
oscillation frequency, or some other specific temporal property of neuronal activity. 
The DOF is computed by circuitry which is organized in a columnar structure, 
shown in figure 2A. There are two primary circuits which operate to compute the 
direction of figure; one being a temporal-dependent/spatial-independent (TDSI) 
circuit selective to closure, the other a spatial-dependent/temporal-independent

(SDTI) circuit selective to similarity and proximity. There are also two secondary 
circuits which play a transient role in determining direction of figure. One is based 
on the observation that concave segments bounded by discontinuities are a cue for 
occlusion and ownership, while the other considers the direction of line endings 
as a potential cue. Figure lB summarizes the cues used to determine direction 
of figure. In this paper, we focus on the TDSI and SDTI circuits since they best 
illustrate the nature of the dual linding mechanisms. The perceptual consequences 
of attributing closure discrimination to temporal binding and similarity/proximity 
to spatial binding is illustrated in figure 3. 
2.1 TDSI CIRCUIT 
Figure 2B(i) shows the neural architecture of the TDSI mechanism. The activity 
of the TDSI circuit selective for a direction of figure a is computed by comparing 
the amount of closure on either side of a contour. Closure is computed by summing 
the temporal dependent inputs over all directions i; 
TDSI = $(ti)-- . $i

[x] = x) and s(ti) and s-8��(t.

activation of a unit along the direction i (For simulations i varies between 0 � and 
315 � by increments of 45�), At determines the range of temporal binding values 
over which the column will integrate input, and S2, is the activation threshold. The 
temporal dependence of this circuit implies that only those DOF columns having 
the same temporal binding value affect the closure computation. 
2.2 SDTI CIRCUIT 
Figure 2B(ii) illustrates the neural architecture of the SDTI mechanism. The SDTI 
circuit organizes elements in the scene based on proximity and similarity of 
orientation. Unlike the TDSI circuit which depends upon temporal binding, the 
SDTI circuit uses spatial binding to access information across the network. 
Activity is integrated from units with similar orientation tuning which lie in a 
direction orthogonal to the contour (i.e. from parallel line segments). The activity 
of the SDTI circuit selective for a direction of figure a is computed by comparing 
input from similar orientations on either side of a contour;
