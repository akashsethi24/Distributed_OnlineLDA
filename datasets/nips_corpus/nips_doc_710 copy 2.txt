ABSTRACT 
A variant of the encoder architecture, where units at the input and out- 
put layers represent nodes on a graph, is applied to the task of mapping 
locations to sets of neighboring locations. The degree to which the re- 
suiting internal (i.e. hidden unit) representations reflect global proper- 
ties of the environment depends upon several parameters of the learning 
procedure. Architectural bottlenecks, noise, and incremental learning of 
landmarks are shown to be important factors in maintaining topograph- 
ic relationships at a global scale. 
I INTRODUCTION 
The acquisition of spatial knowledge by exploration of an environment has been the sub- 
ject of several recent experimental studies, investigating such phenomena as the relation- 
ship between distance estimation and priming (e.g. McNamara et al., 1989) and the influ- 
ence of route information (McNamara et al., 1984). Clayton and Habibi (1991) have gath- 
ered data suggesting that temporal contiguity during exploration is an important factor in 
determining associations between spatially distinct sites. This data supports the notion 
that spatial associations are built by a temporal process that is active during exploration 
and by extension supports Hebb's (1949) neurophysiological postulate that temporal as- 
sociations underlie mechanisms of synaptic learning. Local spatial information acquired 
during the exploration process is continuously integrated into a global representation of 
the environment (cognitive map), which is typically arrived at by also considering global 
consxaints, such as low dimensionality, not explicitly represented in the local relation- 
ships.

2 NETWORK ARCHITECTURE AND TRAINING 
The goal of this network design is to reveal structure among the internal representations 
that emerges solely from integration of local spatial associations; in other words, to show 
how a network Ixained to learn only local spatial associations characteristic of an environ- 
ment can develop internal representations which capture global spatial properties. A vari- 
ant of the encoder architecture (Ackley et al., 1985) is used to associate each node on a 2- 
D graph with the set of its neighboring nodes, as defined by the arcs in the graph. This 2- 
D neighborhood mapping task is similar to the 1-D task explored by Wiles (1993) using 
an N-2-N architecture, which can be characterized in terms of a graph environment as a 
circular chain with broad neighborhoods. 
In the neighborhood mapping experiments described in the following, the graph nodes are 
visited at random: at each iteration, a Ixaining pair (node-neighborhood) is selected at ran- 
dom from the training set. As in the standard encoder task, the input patterns are all or-' 
thogonal, so that there is no structure in the input domain that the network could exploit 
in constructing the internal representations; the only information about the structure of 
the environment comes from the local associations that the network is shown during 
training. 
2.1 N-H-N NETWORKS 
The neighborhood mapping task was first studied using a strictly layered feed-forward N- 
H-N architecture, where N is the number of input and output units, corresponding to the 
number of nodes in the environment, and H is the number of units in the single hidden 
layer. Experiments were done using square grid environments with wrap-around (toroidal) 
and without wrap-around (bounded) at the edges. The resulting hidden unit representations 
reflect global properties of the environment to the extent that distances between them cor- 
relate with distances between corresponding points on the grid. These two distance mea- 
sures are plotted against one another in Figure 1 for toroidal and bounded environments.

2.2 N-2-H-N Networks 
A hidden layer with just two units forces representations into a 2-D space, which matches 
the dimensionality of the environment. Under this constraint, the image of the environ- 
ment in the 2-D space may reflect the topological structure of the environment. This con- 
jecture leads to a further conjecture that the 2-D representations will also reveal global re- 
lationships of the environment. Since the neighborhoods in a 2-D representation are not 
linearly separable regions, another layer (H-layer) is introduced between the two-unit layer 
and the output (see Figure 2). Thus, the network has a strictly layered feed-forward 
N-2-H-N architecture, where the N units at the input and output layers correspond to the 
N nodes in the environment, two units make up the topographic layer, and H is the num- 
ber of units chosen for the new layer (H is estimated according to the complexity of the 
graph). Responses for the hidden units (in both the T- and H-layers) are computed using 
the hyperbolic tangent (which ranges from -1 to +1), while the standard sigmoid (0 to +1) 
is used for the output units, to promote orthogonality between representations (Munro, 
1989). Instead of the squared error, the cross enU:opy function (Hinton, 1987) is used to 
avoid problems with low derivatives observed in early versions of the network.

3 RESULTS 
3.1 T-UNIT RESPONSES 
Neighborhood mapping experiments were done using bounded square grid environments 
and N-2-H-N networks. After training, the topographic unit activities corresponding to 
each of the N possible inputs are plotted, with connecting lines representing the arcs from 
1104 Ghiselli-Crippa and Munro 
the environment. Each axis in Figure 3 represents the activity of one of the T-units. 
These maps can be readily examined to study the relationship between their global struc- 
ture and the structure of the environment. The receptive fields of the T-units give an alter- 
native representation of the same data: the response of each T-unit to all N inputs is repre- 
sented by N circles arranged in the same configuration as the nodes in the grid environ- 
ment. Circle size is proportional to the absolute value of the unit activity; foled circles 
indicate negative values, open circles indicate positive values. The receptive field repre- 
sents the T-unit's sensitivity with respect to the environment.

The two 3x3 cases shown in Figure 3 illuslxate alternative solutions that are each locally 
consistent, but have different global structure. In the first case, it is evident how the first 
unit is sensitive to changes in the vertical location of the grid nodes, while the second 
unit is sensitive to their horizontal location. The axes are essentially rotated 45 degrees in 
the second case. Except for this rotation of the reference axes, both representations cap- 
tured the global structure of the 3x3 environment. 
3.2 NOISE IN THE HIDDEN UNITS 
While networks tended to form maps in the T-layer that reflect the global structure of the 
environment, in some cases the maps showed correspondences that were less obvious: 
i.e., the grid lines crossed, even though the network converged. A few techniques have 
proven valuable for promoting global correspondence between the topographic representa- 
tions and the environment, including Judd and Munro's (1993) inlxoduction of noise as 
pressure to separate representations. The noise is implemented as a small probability for

reversing the sign of individual H-unit outputs. As reported in a previous study 
(Ghiselli-Crippa and Munro, 1994), the presence of noise causes the network to develop 
topographic representations which are more separated, and therefore more robust, so that 
the correct output units can be activated even if one or more of the H-units provides an 
incorrect output. From another point of view, the noise can be seen as causing the net- 
work to behave as if it had an effective number of hidden units which is smaller than the 
given number H. The introduction of noise as a means to promote robust topographic 
representations can be appreciated by examining Figure 4, which illustrates the represen- 
tations of a 5x5 grid developed by a 25-2-20-25 network trained without noise (left) and 
with noise (middle) (the network was initialized with the same set of small random 
weights in all cases). Note that the representations developed by the network subject to 
noise are more separated and exhibit the same global structure as the environment. To 
avoid convergence problems observed with the use of noise throughout the whole training 
process, the noise can be introduced at the beginning of training and then gradually re- 
duced over time. 
A similar technique involves the use of low-level noise injected in the T-layer to directly 
promote the formation of well-separated representations. Either Gaussian or uniform 
noise directly added to the T-unit outputs gives comparable results. The use of noise in 
either hidden layer has a beneficial influence on the formation of gl
