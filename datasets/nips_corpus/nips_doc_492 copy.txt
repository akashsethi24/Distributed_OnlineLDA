ABSTRACT 
The dendritic trees of cortical pyramidal neurons seem ideally suited to 
perform local processing on inputs. To explore some of the implications 
of this complexity for the computational power of neurons, we simulated 
a realistic biophysical model of a hippocampal pyramidal cell in which a 
cold spot--a high density patch of inhibitory Ca-dependent K channels 
and a colocalized patch of Ca channels--was present at a dendritic 
branch point. The cold spot induced a nonmonotonic relationship be- 
tween the strength of the synaptic input and the probability of neuronal 
fn-ing. This effect could also be interpreted as an analog stochastic XOR. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
Cortical neurons consist of a highly branched dendritic tree that is electrically coupled to 
the soma. In a typical hippocampal pyramidal cell, over 10,000 excitatory synaptic inputs 
are distributed across the tree (Brown and Zador, 1990). Synaptic activity results in current 
flow through a transient conductance increase at the point of synaptic contact with the 
membrane. Since the primary means of rapid intraneuronal signalling is electrical, infor- 
mation flow can be characterized in terms of the electrical circuit defined by the synapses, 
the dendritic tree, and the soma. 
Over a dozen nonlinear membrane channels have been described in hippocampal pyrami- 
dal neurons (Brown and Zador, 1990). There is experimental evidence for a heterogeneous 
distribution of some of these channels in the dendritic tree (e.g. Jones et al., 1989). In the 
absence of these dendritic channels, the input-output function can sometimes be reasonably 
approximated by a modified sigmoidal model. Here we report that introducing a cold spot

at the junction of two dendritic branches can result in a fundamentally different, nonmono- 
tonic input-output function. 
2 MODEL 
The biophysical details of the circuit class defined by dendritic trees have been well char- 
acterized (reviewed in Rall, 1977; Jack et al., 1983). The fundamental circuit consists of a 
linear and a nonlinear component. The linear component can be approximated by a set of 
electrical compartments coupled in series (Fig. 1C), each consisting of a resistor and capac- 
itor in parallel (Fig. lB). The nonlinear component consists of a set of nonlinear resistors 
in parallel with the capacitance. 
The model is summarized in Fig. 1A. Briefly, simulations were performed on a 
3000-compartment anatomical reconstruction of a region CA1 hippocampal neuron (Clai- 
borne et al., 1992; Brown et al., 1992). All dendritic membrane was passive, except at the 
cold spot (Fig. 1A). At the soma, fast K and Na channels (cf. Hodgkin-Huxley, 1952) gen- 
erated action potentials in response to stimuli. The parameters for these channels were 
modified from Lytton and Sejnowski (1991; cf. Borg-Graham, 1991).

Fig. 1 The model. (A) The 3000-compartment electrical model used in these simulations was ob- 
tained from a 3-dimensional reconstruction of a hippocampal region CA1 pyramidal neuron (Clai- 
borne et al, 1992). Each synaptic pathway (A-D) consisted of an adjustable number of synapses 
at'rayed along the single branch indicated (see text). Random background activity was generated with 
a spatially uniform distribution of synapses firing according to Poisson statistics. The neuronal mem- 
brane was completely passive (linear), except at the indicated cold spot and at the soma. (B) In the 
nonlinear circuit associated with a patch a neuronal membrane containing active channels, each chan- 
nel is described by a voltage-dependent conductance in series with its an ionic bauer), (see text). In 
the present model the channels were spatially localized, so no single patch contained all of the non- 
linearities depicted in this hypothetical illustration. (i+ A dendritic segment is illustrated in which 
both electrical and Ca 2+ dynamics were modelled. C buffering, and both radial and longitudinal 
Ca 2+ diffusion were simulated.

We distinguished four synapfic pathways AoD (see Fig. 1A). Each pathway consisted of a 
population of synapses activated synchronously. The synapses were of the fast AMPA type 
(see Brown et. al., 1992). In addition, random background synapfic activity distributed uni- 
formly across the dendrific tree fired according to Poisson statistics. 
The cold spot consisted of a high density of a Ca-activated K channel, the AHP current 
(Lancaster and Nicoll, 1987; Lancaster et. al., 1991) colocalized with a low density patch 
of N-type Ca channels (Lytton and Sejnowski, 1991; cf. Borg:Graham, 1991). Upon local- 
ized depolarizafion in the region of the cold spot, influx of ca ':+ through e Ca channel re- 
sulted in a transient increase in the local [ca':+]. The model included ca z+ buffering, and 
both radial and longitudinal diffusion in the region of the cold spot. The increased [Ca 2+] 
activated the inhibitory AHP current. The interplay between the direct excitatory effect of 
synapfic input, and its inhibitory effect via the AHP channels formed the functional basis 
of the cold spot. 
3 RESULTS 
3.1 DYNAMIC BEHAVIOR 
Representative behavior of the model is illustrated in Fig. 2. The somatic potential is plot- 
ted as a function of time in a series of simulations in which the number of activated syn- 
apses in pathway A/B was increased from 0 to about 100. For the first 100 msec of each 
simulation, background synaptic activity generated a noisy baseline. At t = 100 msec, the 
indicated number of synapses fired synchronously five times at 100 Hz. Since the back- 
ground activity was noisy, the outcome of the each simulation was a random process. 
The key effect of the cold spot was to impose a limit on the maximum stimulus amplitude 
that caused fh-ing, resulting in a window of stimulus strengths that triggered an action po- 
tential. In the absence of the cold spot a greater synaptic stimulus invariably increased the 
likelihood that a spike Fired. This limit resulted from the relative magnitude of the AHP

stimulus intensity. At t = 100 msec, a synapfic stimulus consisting of 5 pulses was acfivitated. The 
noisy baseline resulted from random synapfic input. A single action potential resulted for input in- 
tensifies within a range determined by the kinetics of the cold spot.

current threshold to the threshold for somatic spiking. The AHP current required a rela- 
tively high level of activity for its activation. This AHP current threshold reflected the 
sigmoidal voltage dependence of N-type Ca current activation (V/2 = -28 rnV), since only 
as the dendritic voltage approached V/2 did dendrific [Ca 2+] rise enough to activate the 
AHP current. Because V/2 was much higher than the threshold for somatic spiking (about 
-55 rnV under current clamp), there was a window of stimulus strengths sufficient to trigger 
a somatic action potential but insufficient to activate the AHP current. Only within this 
window of between about 20 and 60 synapses (Fig. 2) did an action potential occur. 
3.2 LOCAL NON-MONOTONIC RESPONSE FUNCTION 
Because the background activity was random, the outcome of each simulation (e.g. Fig. 2) 
represented a sample of a random process. This random process can be used to define many 
different random variables. One variable of interest is whether a spike fired in response to 
a stimulus. Although this measure ignores the dynamic nature of neuronal activity, it was 
still relatively informative because in these simulations no more than one spike fired per 
experiment. 
Fig. 3A shows the dependence of firing probability on stimulus strength. It was obtained 
by averaging over a population of simulations of the type illustrated in Fig. 2. In the ab- 
sence of AHP current (dotted line), the f'Lring probability was a sigmoidal function of activ- 
ity. In its presence, the f'u-'ing probability was a smooth nonmonotonic function of the 
activity (solid line). The fu'ing probability was maximum at about 35 synapses, and oc- 
curred only in the range between about 10 and 80 synapses. The statistics illustrated in Fig. 
3A quantfly the nonmonotonicity that is implied by the single sample shown in Fig. 2. 
Spikes required the somatic Hodgkin-Huxley-like Na and K channels. To a first approxi- 
marion, the effect of these channels was to convert a continuous variable the somatic volt- 
age into a discrete variable the presence or absence of a spike. Although this 
approximation ignores the complex interactions between the soma and the cold spot, it is 
useful for a qualitative analysis. The nonmonotonic dependence of somatic activity on syn-
