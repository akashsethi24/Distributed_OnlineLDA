Abstract 
Several regions of the rat brain contain neurons known as head-direc- 
tion cells, which encode the animal's directional heading during spatial 
navigation. This paper presents a biophysical model of head-direction 
cell activity, which suggests that a thalamocortical circuit might com- 
pute the rat's head direction by integrating the angular velocity of the 
head over time. The model was implemented using the neural simulator 
NEURON, and makes testable predictions about the structure and func- 
tion of the rat head-direction circuit. 
1 HEAD-DIRECTION CELLS 
As a rat navigates through space, neurons called head-direction cells encode the animai's 
directional heading in the horizontal plane (Ranck, 1984; Taube, Muller, & Ranck, 1990). 
Head-direction cells have been recorded in several brain areas, including the postsubicu- 
lum (Ranck, 1984) and anterior thalamus (Taube, 1995). A variety of theories have pro- 
posed that head-direction cells might play an important role in spatial learning and 
navigation (Brown & Sharp, 1995; Burgess, Recce, & O'Keefe, 1994; McNaughton, 
Knierim, & Wilson, 1995; Wan, Touretzky, & Redish, 1994; Zhang, 1995). 
1.1 BASIC FIRING PROPERTIES 
A head-direction cell fires action potentials only when the rat's head is facing in a particu- 
lar direction with respect to the static surrounding environment, regardless of the animal's 
location within that environment. Head-direction cells are not influenced by the position 
of the rat's head with respect to its body, they are only influenced by the direction of the

head with respect to the stationary reference frame of the spatial environment. Each head- 
direction cell has its own directional preference, so that together, the entire population of 
cells can encode any direction that the animal is facing. 
Figure I shows an example of a head-direction cell's directional tuning curve, which plots 
the firing rate of the cell as a function of the rat's momentary head direction. The tuning 
curve shows that this cell fires maximally when the rat's head is facing in a preferred 
direction of about 160 degrees. The cell fires less rapidly for directions close to 160 
degrees, and stops firing altogether for directions that are far from 160 degrees. 
1.2 THE VELOCITY INTEGRATION HYPOTHESIS 
McNaughton, Chen, & Markus (1991) have proposed that head-direction cells might rely 
on a process of dead-reckoning to calculate the rat's current head direction, based on the 
previous head direction and the angular velocity at which the head is turning. That is, 
head-direction cells might compute the directional position of the head by integrating the 
angular velocity of the head over time. This velocity integration hypothesis is supported 
by three experimental findings. First, several brain regions that are associated with head- 
direction cells contain angular velocity cells, neurons that fire in proportion to the angular 
head velocity (McNaughton et al., 1994; Sharp, in press). Second, some head-direction 
cells in postsubiculum are modulated by angular head velocity, such that their peak firing 
rate is higher if the head is turning in one direction than in the other (Taube et al., 1990). 
Third, it has recently been found that head-direction cells in the anterior thalamus, but not 
the postsubiculum, anticipate the future direction of the rat's head (Blair & Sharp, 1995). 
1.3 ANTICIPATORY HEAD-DIRECTION CELLS 
Blair and Sharp (1995) discovered that head-direction cells in the anterior thalamus shift 
their directional preference to the left during clockwise turns, and to the right during coun- 
terclockwise turns. They showed that this shift occurs systematically as a function of head 
velocity, in a way that allows these cells anticipate the future direction of the rat's head. 
To illustrate this, consider a cell that fires whenever the head will be facing a specific 
direction, 0, in the near future. How would such a cell behave? There are three cases to 
consider. First, imagine that the rat's head is turning clockwise, approaching the direction 
0 from the left side. In this case, the anticipatory cell must fire when the head is facing to 
the left of 0, because being to the left of 0 and turning clockwise predicts arrival at 0 in the 
near future. Second, when the head is turning counterclockwise and approaching 0 from 
the right side, the anticipatory cell must fire when the head is to the right of 0. Third, if the 
head is still, then the cell should only fire if the head is presently facing 0. 
In summary, an anticipatory head direction cell should shift its directional preference to 
the left during clockwise turns, to the right during counterclockwise turns, and not at all 
when the head is still. This behavior can be formalized by the equation 
Ix(v) = 0 - v'r, [ 1] 
154 H.T. BLAIR 
where g denotes the cell's preferred present head direction, v denotes the angular velocity 
of the head, 0 denotes the future head direction that the cell anticipates, and 'c is a constant 
time delay by which the cell's activity anticipates arrival at 0. Equation I assumes that g 
is measured in degrees. which increase in the clockwise direction, and that v is positive for 
clockwise head turns. and negative for counterclockwise head tums. Blair & Sharp (1995) 
have demonstrated that Equation I provides a good approximation of head-direction cell 
behavior in the anterior thalamus. 
1.3 ANTICIPATORY TIME DELAY () 
Initial reports suggested that head-direction cells in the anterior thalamus anticipate the 
future head direction by an average time delay of : = 40 msec, whereas postsubicular cells 
encode the present head direction, and therefore anticipate by : = 0 msec (Blair & 
Sharp, 1995; Taube & Muller, 1995). However, recent evidence suggests that individual 
neurons in the anterior thalamus may be temporally tuned to anticipate the rat's future 
head-direction by different time delays between 0-100 msec, and that postsubicular cells 
may lag behind the present head-direction by about 10 msec (Blair & Sharp, 1996). 
2 A BIOPHYSICAL MODEL 
This section describes a biophysical model that accounts for the properties of head-direc- 
tion cells in postsubiculum and anterior thalamus, by proposing that they might be con- 
nected to form a thalamocortical circuit. The next section presents simulation results from 
an implementation of the model, using the neural simulator NEURON (Hines, 1993). 
2.1 NEURAL ELEMENTS 
Figure 2 illustrates a basic circuit for computing the rat's head-direction. The circuit con- 
sists of five types of cells: 1) Present Head-Direction (PHD) Cells encode the present 
direction of the rat's head, 2) Anticipator), Head-Direction (AHD) Cells encode the future 
direction of the rat's head, 3)Angular-Velocity (AV) Cells encode the angular velocity of 
the rat's head (the CLK AV Cell is active during clockwise turns, and the CNT AV Cell is 
active during counterclockwise turns), 4) the Angular Speed (AS) Cell fires in inverse pro- 
portion to the angular speed of the head, regardless of the turning direction (that is, the AS 
Cell rites at a lower rate during fast tums, and at a higher rate during slow turns), 5) Angu- 
lar-Velocity Modulated Head-Direction (AVHD) Cells are head-direction cells that fire

only when the head is turning in one direction and not the other (the CLK AVHD Cell fires 
in its preferred direction only when the head is turning clockwise, and the CNT AVHD 
Cell fires in its preferred direction only when the head turns counterclockwise). 
2.2 FUNCTIONAL CHARACTERISTICS 
In the model, AHD Cells directly excite their neighbors on either side, but indirectly 
inhibit these same neighbors via the AVHD Cells, which act as inhibitory interneurons. 
AHD Cells also send excitatory feedback connections to themselves (omitted from Figure 
2 for clarity), so that once they become active, they remain active until they are turned off 
by inhibitory input (the rate of firing can also be modulated by inhibitory input). When 
the rat is not turning its head, the cell representing the current head direction rites con- 
stantly, both exciting and inhibiting its neighbors. In the steady-state condition (i.e., when 
the rat is not turning its head), lateral inhibition exceeds lateral excitation, and therefore 
activity does not spread in either direction through the layer of AHD Cells. However, 
when the rat begins turning its head, some of the AVHD Cells are turned off, allowing 
activity to spread in one direction. For example, during a clockwise head turn, the CLK 
AV Cell becomes active, and inhibits the layer of CNT AVHD Cells. As a result, AHD 
Cells stop inhibiting their right neighbors, so activity spreads to the right through the layer 
of AHD Cells. Because AHD Cells continue to inhibit their neighbors to the left, activity 
is shut down in the leftward direction, in the wake of the activity spreading to the right. 
The speed of propagation through the AHD layer is governed by the AS Cell. During 
slow head turns, the AS Cell fires at a high rate, strongly inhibiting the AHD Cells, and 
thereby slowing
