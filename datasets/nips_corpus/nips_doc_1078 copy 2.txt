Abstract 
Binaural coincidence detection is essential for the localization of 
external sounds and requires auditory signal processing with high 
temporal precision. We present an integrate-and-fire model of spike 
processing in the auditory pathway of the barn owl. It is shown that 
a temporal precision in the microsecond range can be achieved with 
neuronal time constants which are at least one magnitude longer. 
An important feature of our model is an unsupervised Hebbian 
learning rule which leads to a temporal fine tuning of the neuronal 
connections.

Temporal Coding in the Submillisecond Range: Model of Barn Owl Auditory Pathway 125 
1 Introduction 
Owls are able to locate acoustic signals based on extraction of interaural time dif- 
ference by coincidence detection [1, 2]. The spatial resolution of sound localization 
found in experiments corresponds to a temporal resolution of auditory signal pro- 
cessing well below one millisecond. It follows that both the firing of spikes and their 
transmission along the so-called time pathway of the auditory system must occur 
with high temporal precision. 
Each neuron in the nucleus magnocellularis, the second processing stage in the 
ascending auditory pathway, responds to signals in a narrow frequency range. Its 
spikes are phase locked to the external signal (Fig. la) for frequencies up to 8 
kHz [3]. Axons from the nucleus magnocellularis project to the nucleus laminaris 
where signals from the right and left ear converge. Owls use the interaural phase 
difference for azimuthal sound localization. Since barn owls can locate signals with a 
precision of one degree of azimuthal angle, the temporal precision of spike encoding 
and transmission must be at least in the range of some 10 its. 
This poses at least two severe problems. First, the neural architecture has to be 
adapted to operating with high temporal precision. Considering the fact that the 
total delay from the ear to the nucleus magnocellularis is approximately 2-3 ms [4], 
a temporal precision of some 10 us requires some fine tuning, possibly based on 
learning. Here we suggest that Hebbian learning is an appropriate mechanism. Sec- 
ond, neurons must operate with the necessary temporal precision. A firing precision 
of some 10 us seems truly remarkable considering the fact that the membrane time 
constant is probably in the millisecond range. Nevertheless, it is shown below that 
neuronal spikes can be transmitted with the required temporal precision. 
2 Neuron model 
We concentrate on a single frequency channel of the auditory pathway and model 
a neuron of the nucleus magnocellularis. Since synapses are directly located on the 
soma, the spatial structure of the neuron can be reduced to a single compartment. 
In order to simplify the dynamics, we take an integrate-and-fire unit. Its membrane 
potential changes according to 
d u 
u- +I(t) (1) 
dt ro 
where I(t) is some input and r0 is the membrane time constant. The neuron fires, 
if u(t) crosses a threshold 0 = 1. This defines a firing time to. After firing u is reset 
to an initial value u0 = 0. Since auditory neurons are known to be fast, we assume 
a membrane time constant of 2 ms. Note that this is shorter than in other areas of 
the brain, but still a factor of 4 longer than the period of a 2 kHz sound signal. 
The magnocellular neuron receives input from several presynaptic neurons I _< k _< 
K. Each input spike at time t generates a current pulse which decays exponentially 
with a fast time constant rr = 0.02 ms. The magnitude of the current pulse depends 
on the coupling strength J}. The total input is 
I(t) = y. J} exp( t - t ) O(t - t) 
rr 
where O(x) is the unit step function and the sum runs over all input spikes.

Fig. 1. Principles of phase locking and learning. a) The stimulus consists of a sound 
wave (top). Spikes of auditory nerve fibers leading to the nucleus magnocellularis 
are phase-locked to the periodic wave, that is, they occur at a preferred phase in 
relation to the sound, but with some jitter r. Three examples of phase-locked 
spike trains are indicated. b) Before learning (left), many auditory input fibers 
converge to a neuron of the nucleus magnocellularis. Because of axonal delays 
which vary between different fibers, spikes arrive incoherently even though they 
are generated in a phase locked fashion. Due to averaging over several incoherent 
inputs, the total postsynaptic potential (bottom left) of a magnocellular neuron 
follows a rather smooth trajectory with no significant temporal structure. After 
learning (right) most connections have disappeared and only a few strong contacts 
remain. Input spikes now arrive coherently and the postsynaptic potential exhibits 
a clear oscillatory structure. Note that firing must occur during the rising phase of 
the oscillation. Thus output spikes will be phase locked.

All input signals belong to the same frequency channel with a carrier frequency of 
2 kHz (period T - 0.5 ms), but the inputs arise from different presynaptic neurons 
(1 _ k _ K). Their axons have different diameter and length leading to a signal 
transmission delay Ae which varies between 2 and 3 ms [4]. Note that a delay as 
small as 0.25 ms shifts the signal by half a period. 
Each input signal consists of a periodic spike train subject to two types of noise. 
First, a presynaptic neuron may not fire regularly every period but, on average, 
every n th period only where n  1/(tT) and t is the mean firing rate of the neuron. 
For the sake of simplicity, we set n - 1. Second, the spikes may occur slightly too 
early or too late compared to the mean delay A. Based on experimental results, we 
assume a typical shift a - :E0.05 ms [3]. Specifically we assume in our model that 
inputs from a presynaptic neuron k arrive with the probability density 
P(tl)- V( - exp -ff . (S) 
where Ae is the axonal transmission delay of input k (Fig. 1). 
3 Temporal tuning through learning 
We assume a developmental period of unsupervised learning during which a fine 
tuning of the temporal characteristics of signal transmission takes place (Fig. lb). 
Before learning the magnocellular neuron receives many inputs (K - 50) with weak 
coupling (Je - 1). Due to the broad distribution of delays the t.otal input (2) has, 
apart from fluctuations, no temporal structure. After learning, the magnocellular 
neuron receives input from two or three presynaptic neurons only. The connections 
to those neurons have become very effective; cf. Fig. 2.

Fig. 2. Learning. We plot the number of synaptic contacts (y-azis) for each delay 
A (z-azis). (a) At the beginning, the neuron has contacts to 50 presynaptic neurons 
with delays 2ms _ A _ 3ms. (b) and (c) During learning, some presynaptic neurons 
increase their number of contacts, other contacts disappear. (d) After learning, 
contacts to three presynaptic neurons with delays 2.25, 2.28, and 2.8 ms remain. 
The remaining contacts are very strong.

The constant Jk measures the total coupling strength between a presynaptic neuron 
k and the postsynaptic neuron. Values of Jk larger than one indicate that several 
synapses have been formed. It has been estimated from anatomical data that a 
fully developed magnocellular neuron receives inputs from as few as 1-4 presynaptic 
neurons, but each presynaptic axon shows multiple branching near the postsynaptic 
soma and makes up to one hundred synaptic contacts on the soma of the magnocel- 
lular neuron[5]. The result of our simulation study is consistent with this finding. In 
our model, learning leads to a final state with a few but highly effective inputs. The 
remaining inputs all have the same time delay modulo the period T of the stimulus. 
Thus, learning leads to reduction of the number of input neurons contacts with a 
nucleus magnocellularis neuron. This is the fine tuning of the neuronal connections 
necessary for precise temporal coding (see below, section 4).

Fig. 3. (a) Time window of learning W(x). Along the x-axis we plot the time 
difference between presynaptic and postsynaptic .fling x = ti t -t . The window 
function W(x) has a positive and a negative phase. Learning is most effective, if 
the postsynaptic spike is late by 0.08 ms (inset). (b) Postsynaptic potential e(x). 
Each input spike evoked a postsynaptic potential which decays with a time constant 
of 2 ms. Since synapses are located directly at the soma, the rise time is very 
fast (see inset). Our learning scenario requires that the rise time of e(x) should be 
approximately equal to the time x where W(x) has its maximum. 
In our model, temporal tuning is achieved by a variant of Hebbian learning. In 
standard Hebbian learning, synaptic weights are changed if pre- and postsynaptic 
activity occurs simultaneously. In the context of temporal coding by spikes, the
