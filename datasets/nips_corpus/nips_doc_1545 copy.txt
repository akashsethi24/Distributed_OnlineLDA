Abstract 
The ARTMAP-FD neural network performs both identification 
(placing test patterns in classes encountered during training) and 
familiarity discrimination (judging whether a test pattern belongs 
to any of the classes encountered during training). The perfor- 
mance of ARTMAP-FD is tested on radar pulse data obtained in 
the field, and compared to that of the nearest-neighbor-based NEN 
algorithm and to a k ) I extension of NEN. 
I Introduction 
The recognition process involves both identification and familiarity discrimination. 
Consider, for example, a neural network designed to identify aircraft based on their 
radar reflections and trained on sample reflections from ten types of aircraft A... J. 
After training, the network should correctly classify radar reflections belonging to 
the familiar classes A... J, but it should also abstain from making a meaningless 
guess when presented with a radar reflection from an object belonging to a different, 
unfamiliar class. Familiarity discrimination is also referred to as novelty detection, 
a reject option, and recognition in partially exposed environments. 
ARTMAP-FD, an extension of fuzzy ARTMAP that performs familiarity discrimi- 
nation, has shown its effectiveness on datasets consisting of simulated radar range 
profiles from aircraft targets [1, 2]. In the present paper we examine the perfor- 
mance of ARTMAP-FD on radar pulse data obtained in the field, and compare it

to that of NEN, a nearest-neighbor-based familiarity discrimination algorithm, and 
to a k > 1 extension of NEN. 
2 Fuzzy ARTMAP 
Fuzzy ARTMAP [3] is a self-organizing neural network for learning, recognition, 
and prediction. Each input a learns to predict an output class K. During training, 
the network creates internal recognition categories, with the number of categories 
determined on-line by predictive success. Components of the vector a are scaled 
so that each aie [0, 1] (i - 1...M). Complement coding [4] doubles the number 
of components in the input vector, which becomes A -- (a, aC), where the i t' 
component of a c is a -- (1-ai). With fast learning, the weight vector w 3 records the 
largest and smallest component values of input vectors placed in the jth category. 
The 2M-dimensional vector wj may be visualized as the hyperbox /j that just 
encloses all the vectors a that selected category j during training. 
Activation of the coding field F2 is determined by the Weber law choice function 
Tj(A) =1 A A wj I /(o+ I wj I), where (P A Q)i -- min(Pi, Qi) and ] P 1= 
2M 
Yi= [ Pi 1. With winner-take-all coding, the F2 node J that receives the largest 
F1 - F2 input Tj becomes active. Node J remains active if it satisfies the matching 
criterion: [ AAwj [ / [ A [ = [ AAws [ /M > p, where p  [0, 1] is the dimensionless 
vigilance parameter. Otherwise, the network resets the active F2 node and searches 
until J satisfies the matching criterion. If node J then makes an incorrect class 
prediction, a match tracking signal raises vigilance just enough to induce a search, 
which continues until either some F2 node becomes active for the first time, in 
which case J learns the correct output class label k(J) = K; or a node J that has 
previously learned to predict K becomes active. During testing, a pattern a that 
activates node J is predicted to belong to the class K = k(J). 
3 ARTMAP-FD 
Familiarity measure. During testing, an input pattern a is defined as familiar 
when a familiarity function �(A) is greater than a decision threshold . Once a 
category choice has been made by the winner-take-all rule, fuzzy ARTMAP ignores 
the size of the input Tj. In contrast, ARTMAP-FD uses Tj to define familiarity, 
taking 
T(A) [ A^w, I 
qS(A) = TjMA x = I Wa I ' (1) 
where T MAx =1 wa I /(a+ I wj 1). This maximal value of T; is attained by each 
input a that lies in the hyperbox Ra, since I A A wa [=1 w; I for these points. 
An input that chooses category J during testing is then assigned the maximum 
familiarity value 1 if and only if a lies within Rj. 
Familiarity discrimination algorithm. ARTMAP-FD is identical to fuzzy 
ARTMAP during training. During testing, �(A) is computed after fuzzy ARTMAP 
has yielded a winning node J and a predicted class K = k(d). If 0(A) > % 
ARTMAP-FD predicts class K for the input a. If b(A) < -, a is regarded as 
belonging to an unfamiliar class and the network makes no prediction. 
Note that fuzzy ARTMAP can also abstain from classification, when the baseline 
vigilance parameter/5 is greater than zero during testing. Typically /5 = 0 during 
training, to maximize code compression. In radar range profile simulations such

as those described below, fuzzy ARTMAP can perform familiarity discrimination 
when t5 > 0 during both training and testing. However, accurate discrimination 
requires that t5 be close to 1, which causes category proliferation during training. 
Range profile simulations have also set p - 0 during both training and testing, but 
with the familiarity measure set equal to the fuzzy ARTMAP match function: 
(A) = I A ^wJ I (2) 
M 
This approach is essentially equivalent to taking g = 0 during training and t5 > 0 
during testing, with t5 = 7. However, for a test set input a  R j, the function 
defined by (2) sets �(A) =[ wa [ /M, which may be large or small although a is 
familiar. Thus this function does not provide as good familiarity discrimination as 
the one defined by (1), which always sets cS(A) = 1 when a  Ra. Except as noted, 
all the simulations below employ the function (1), with t5 = 0. 
Sequential evidence accumulation. ART-EMAP (Stage 3) [5] identifies a test 
set object's class after exposure to a sequence of input patterns, such as differing 
views, all identified with that one object. Training is identical to that of fuzzy 
ARTMAP, with winner-take-all coding at F2. ART-EMAP generally employs dis- 
tributed F2 coding during testing. With winner-take-all coding during testing as 
well as training, ART-EMAP predicts the object's class to be the one selected by the 
largest number of inputs in the sequence. Extending this approach, ARTMAP-FD 
accumulates familiarity measures for each predicted class K as the test set sequence 
is presented. Once the winning class is determined, the object's familiarity is de- 
fined as the average accumulated familiarity measure of the predicted class during 
the test sequence. 
4 Familiarity discrimination simulations 
Since familiarity discrimination involves placing an input into one of two sets, fa- 
miliar and unfamiliar, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) formalism can 
be used to evaluate the effectiveness of ARTMAP-FD on this task. The hit rate 
H is the fraction of familiar targets the network correctly identifies as familiar and 
the false alarm rate F is the fraction of unfamiliar targets the network incorrectly 
identifies as familiar. An ROC curve is a plot of H vs. F, parameterized by the 
threshold ? (i.e., it is equivalent to the two curves F(-/) and H(7)). The area under 
the ROC curve is the c-index, a measure of predictive accuracy that is independent 
of both the fraction of positive (familiar) cases in the test set and the positive-case 
decision threshold 7. 
An ARTMAP-FD network was trained on simulated radar range profiles from 18 
targets out of a 36-target set (Fig. la). Simulations tested sequential evidence 
accumulation performance for 1, 3, and 100 observations, corresponding to 0.05, 
0.15, and 5.0 sec. of observation (smooth curves, Fig. lb). As in the case of 
identification [6], a combination of multiwavelength range profiles and sequential 
evidence accumulation produces good familiarity discrimination, with the c-index 
approaching I as the number of sequential observations grows. 
Fig. lb also demonstrates the importance of the proper choice of familiarity mea- 
sure. The jagged ROC curve was produced by a familiarity discrimination simula- 
tion identical to that which resulted in the 100-sequential-view smooth curve, but 
using the match function (2) instead of � as given by (1).

5 Familiarity threshold selection 
When a system is placed in operation, one particular decision threshold -/= F must 
be chosen. In a given application, selection of F depends upon the relative cost 
of errors due to missed targets and false alarms. The optimal F corresponds to a 
point on the parameterized ROC curve that is typically close to the upper left-hand 
corner of the unit square, to maximize correct selection of familiar targets (H) while
