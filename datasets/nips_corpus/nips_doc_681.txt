Abstract 
Several research group are inl)hmcnl. ing alalog integrated circuit

circuit nodels have taken several k)nns, including vicico format 
for monitor display, simple scanned out. put for oscilloscope display 
and parallel analog outl3uts suitable for da. ta-acquisition systems.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Several researchers have implemented computational models of biological auditory 
processing, with the goal of incorporating these models into a speech recognition 
system (for a recent review, see (Jankowski, 1992)). These projects have shown the 
promise of the biological approach, sometimes shmving clear performance advan- 
tages over traditional methods. 
The application of these COml)utftional models is limited by their large compu- 
tation and communication req,irement:3, Analog VLSI implementations of these 
neural models may relieve this co,putat. ional burden; several VLSI research groups 
have efforts in this area, and worki,g integrated circuit models of ninny popular 
representations presently cxist. A review of those models is presented in (Lazzaro, 
1991). In this paper, we present an interface method (Mahowald, 1992; Sivilotti, 
1991) that addresses the commtmications iss,es between analog VLSI auditory im- 
plementations and digital processors. 
2. COMMUNICATIONS IN NEURAL SYSTEMS 
Biological neurons con,municate long distances using a pulse representation. Com- 
munications engineers have developed several schemes for communicating on a wire 
using pulses as a[omic units. In these schemes, naximally using the communica- 
tions bandwidth of a wire implies tho mean rate of pulses on the wire is a significan 
fraction of the maxinmm pulse rat,e allowed on the wire. 
Using this criterion, neural systcns use wires wn-y imtficiently. In nost parts of 
brain, most of the wires are esse,tia. lly inac[ive nos[ of lie time. If neural systems 
are not organized to Fully utilize tim available bandwidth of each wire, what does 
neural communication ol)t,inizc? Evidccc suggests that energy conservation is an 
important issue for nmral syst,ens. A sinph' slrat.cgy for energy conservation is 
the reduction of the total nnbcr oF l>lscs i the representat. iot. Many possible 
coding strategies satist, this ewrgy requiretent.

distinctly non-biological aplroach.

3. THE EVENT-ADDRESS PROTOCOL 
The unique characteristics of energy-efficient codes define the remaining off-chip 
communications problem. In the spiking he. ton protocol, the height and width of 
the spike carries no information; the neuron imparts new information only at the 
moment a spike begins. This moment occurs asynchronously; there is no global clock 
synchrouizing the output units. One way of completely specifying the information 
in the output units is an event list,, a tabulation of the precise time each output 
unit begins a new spike. �% can use this specification as a basis for an off-chip 
communications systen, that sends an event-list message off-chip at, the moment an 
outpnt neuron begins a new spike. An ewnt-list message includes the identification 
of the output unit,, and the time of firing. A performance analysis of this protocol 
can be found in (Lazzaro et al., 1992). 
Note that an explicit timest. amp for each e,try in the event list is not. necessary, if 
communication latency between the sending chip and the receiver is a constant. In 
this case, the sender si,nply co,nmu,icates, upo, onset of a spike fi'om an output, the 
identity of the output mit; the receiver can appe, d a locally generated timestamp 
to complete the event. If simplified in this man,mr, we refer to the event-list protocol 
as the event-address protocol. 
We have designed a working systen that computes a model of auditory nerve re- 
sponse, in real time, using analog VLSI processing. This system takes as input 
an analog sound source, a(I uses the event-list representation to comnunicate the 
model output to the host computer.

4. SYSTEMS IMPLEMENTATION 
Figure 1 is a block diagram of this system. A single VLSI chip computes the auditory 
model response; an array of spiking neuron circuits is the final representation of the 
model. This chip also implements the event-address protocol, using asynchronous 
arbitration circuits. The chip produces a parallel binary encoding of the model 
output, as an asynchronous stream of event addresses. These on-chip operations 
are shown inside the dashed rectangle in Figure 1, labelled Chip Architecture. 
Additional digital processing completes the custom hardware in the system. This 
hardware transforms the event-address protocol into an event-list protocol, by 
adding a time lnarker for each event (16 bit time markers with 20ps resolution). 
In addition, the hardware implements the bus interface to the host computer, in 
conjunction with a commercial interface board. The commercial interface board 
supports 10 MBytes/second asynchronous data transfers between our custom hard- 
ware and the host computer, and includes 8 KBytcs of data. buffers. Our display 
software produces a real-time graphical display of the auditory model response, 
using the X window system. 
5. VLSI CIRCUIT DETAILS 
Figure 2 shows a block diagram of the chip. The analog input signal connects 
to circuits that perform analog processing, Illat are fully described and referenced 
in (Lazzaro et al., 1993). The output of this analog processing is represented by 
150 spiking neurons, arranged in a 30 by 5 array. These are the output units of 
the chip; the event-address protocol communicates the activity of these units off 
chip. At the onset of a spike from an output unit, the array position of the spiking 
unit, encoded as a binary number, appears on the output bus. The asynchronous 
output bus is shown in Figure 2 as the data signals marked Encoded X Output 
(column position) and Encoded Y Output (row position), and the acknowledge 
and request control signals A and R. 
We implemented the event-address protocol as an asynchronous arbitration protocol 
in two dimensions. In this sclenc, an output uil, can access two request lines, 
one associated with its row and one associated with its column. Using a wire-OR 
signalling protocol, any outi)tt. unit on a particular row or colmnn may assert the 
request line. Each request line is paired with an acknowledge line, driven by the 
arbitration circuitry outside the array. Row and columu wires for acknowledge and 
request are explicitly shown il Figure 2, as the lines that form a grid inside the 
output unit array. 
At the onset of a spike, an outprat unit asserts its row request line, and waits for 
a reply on its row a.cktowledge liltc. An a.synchronous arbitratiou system, marked 
in Figure 2 as Y Arbitration Tree, assures only one output row is acknowledged. 
After row acknowledgement, tile output unit asserts its column request line, and 
waits for a reply on its column acknowledge line. The arbitration system is shown 
in detail in Figure 2; four two-input arbiter circuits, shown as rectangles marked 
with the letter A, are connected as a tree t.o arbitrate among the 5 column inputs.
