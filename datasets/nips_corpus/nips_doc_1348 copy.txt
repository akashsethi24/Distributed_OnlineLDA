Abstract 
We describe the design, fabrication and test results of an analog CMOS 
VLSI neural network prototype chip intended for phase-based machine 
vision algorithms. The chip implements an image filtering operation 
similar to Gabor-filtering. Because a Gabor filter's output is complex 
valued, it can be used to define a phase at every pixel in an image. This 
phase can be used in robust algorithms for disparity estimation and bin- 
ocular stereo vergence control in stereo vision and for image motion 
analysis. The chip reported here takes an input image and generates two 
outputs at every pixel corresponding to the real and imaginary parts of 
the output. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
Gabor filters are used as preprocessing stages for different tasks in machine vision and 
image processing. Their use has been partially motivated by findings that two dimensional 
Gabor filters can be used to model receptive fields of orientation selective neurons in the 
visual cortex (Daugman, 1980) and three dimensional spatio-temporal Gabor filters can be 
used to model biological image motion analysis (Adelson, 1985). 
A Gabor filter has a complex valued impulse response which is a complex exponential 
modulated by a Gaussian function. In one dimension,

where Oxo and o are real constants corresponding to the angular frequency of the com- 
plex exponential and the standard deviation of the Gaussian.

The phase of the complex valued filter output at a given pixel is related to the location of 
edges and other features in the input image near that pixel. Because translating the image 
input results in a phase shift in the Gabor output, several authors have developed phase- 
based approaches to disparity estimation (Westelius, 1995) and binocular vergence con- 
trol (Theimer, 1994) in stereo vision and image motion analysis (Fleet, 1992). Barron et. 
al.'s comparison (Barron, 1992) of algorithms for optical flow estimation indicates that 
Fleet's algorithm is the most accurate among those tested. 
The remainder of this paper describes the design, fabrication and test results of a prototype 
analog VLSI continuous time neural network which implements a complex valued filter 
similar to the Gabor. 
2 NETWORK AND CIRCUIT ARCHITECTURE 
The prototype implements a Cellular Neural Network (CNN) architecture for Gabor-type 
image filtering (Shi, 1996). It consists of an array of neurons, called cells, each corre- 
sponding to one pixel in the image to be processed. Each cell has two outputs Vr(rt ) and 
vi(rt ) which evolve over time according to the equation 
i(n)J sintOo cos 
L-sino.)xo costOo j Lvi(n + I 
where 3. > 0 and t0 o  [0, 2] are real constants and u(n) is the input image. The feed- 
back from neighbouring cells' outputs enables information to be spread globally through- 
out the array. This network has a unique equilibrium point where the outputs correspond to 
the real and imaginary parts of the result of filtering the image with a complex valued dis- 
crete space convolution kernel which can be approximated by 
g(n) =  I1_ . 
The Gaussian function of the Gabor filter has been replaced by (3./2) e --Ig . The larger 3. 
is, the narrower the impulse response and the larger the bandwidth. Figure 1 shows the 
real (a) and imaginary (b) parts of g(n) for 3. = 0.3 and tOxo = 0.93. The dotted lines 
show the function which modulates the complex exponential.

In the circuit implementation of this CNN, each output corresponds to the voltage across a 
capacitor. We selected the circuit architecture in Figure 2 because it was the least sensitive 
to the effects of random parameter variations among those we considered (Hui, 1996). In 
the figure, resistor labels denote conductances and trapezoidal blocks represent transcon- 
ductance amplifiers labelled by their gains.

The circuit implementation also gives good intuitive understanding of the CNN's opera- 
tion. Assume that the input image is an impulse at pixel n. In the circuit, this corresponds 
to setting the current source 3,2u(n) to 3`2 amps and setting the remaining current sources 
to zero. If the gains and conductances were chosen so that 3, = 0.3 and mxo = 0.93, then 
the steady state voltages across the lower capacitors would follow the spatial distribution 
shown in Figure 1 (a) where the center peak occurs at cell n and the voltages across the 
upper capacitors would follow the distribution shown in Figure l(b). To see how this 
would arise in the circuit, consider the current supplied by the source 3,2u(n). Part of the 
current flows through the conductance G O pushing the voltage Vr(n ) positive. As this 
voltage increases, the two resistors with conductance G 1 cause a smoothing effect which 
pulls the voltages Vr(rt- 1) and Vr(n + 1) up towards Vr(n ) . Current also flows through 
the diagonal resistor with conductance G 2 pulling vi(n + 1) positive as well. At the same 
time, the transconductance amplifier with input Vr(n ) draws current from node vi(n- 1) 
pushing vi(n - 1) negative. The larger G2, the more the voltages at nodes vi(n - 1) and 
v(n + 1) are pushed negative and positive. On the other hand, the larger G 1 , the greater 
the smoothing between nodes. Thus, the larger the ratio

the higher the spatial frequency mxo at which the impulse response oscillates. 
3 DESIGN OF CMOS BUILDING BLOCKS 
This section describes CMOS transistor circuits which implement the transconductance 
amplifiers and resistors in Figure 2. It is not necessary to implement the capacitors explic- 
itly. Since the equilibrium point of the CNN is unique, the parasitic capacitances of the cir- 
cuit are sufficient to ensure the circuit operates correctly. 
3.1 .TRANSCONDUCTANCE AMPLIFIER 
The transconductance amplifiers can be implemented using the circuit shown in 
Figure 3(a). For Vin -- VGD, the output current is approximately lou t = ,J/ssVin where 
[, = g,Cox (IV/L) and (W/L) is the width/length ratio of the differential pair. The 
transistors in the current mirrors are assumed to be matched. Using cascoded current mir-

3.2 RESISTORS 
Since the convolution kernels implemented are modulated sine and cosine functions, the 
nodal voltages Ve(n ) and Vo(n ) can be both positive and negative with respect to the 
ground potential. The resistors in the circuit must be floating and exhibit good linearity 
and invariance to common mode offsets for voltages around the ground potential. Many 
MOS resistor circuits require bias circuitry implemented at every resistor. Since for image 
processing tasks, we are interested in maximizing the number of pixels processed, elimi- 
nating the need for bias circuitry at each cell will decrease its area and in turn increase the 
number of cells implementable within a given area. 
Figure 3(b) shows a resistor circuit which satisfies the requirements above. This circuit is 
essentially a CMOS transmission gate with adjustable gate voltages. The global bias cir- 
cuit which generates the gate voltages in the CMOS resistor is shown on the left. The gate 
bias voltages Va and Va2 are distributed to each resistor designed with the same value. 
Both transistors M n and Mp operate in the conduction region where (Enz, 1995)

and V,, and V,, are nonlinear functions of the gate and threshold voltages. The sizing of 
the NMOS and PMOS transistors can be chosen to decrease the effect of the nonlinearity

due to the (V o + Vs)/2 terms. The conductance of the resistors can be adjusted using 
Ibias ' 
3.3 LIMITATIONS 
Due to the physical constraints of the circuit realizations, not all values of , and tOxo can 
be realized. Because the conductance values are non-negative and the OTA gains are non- 
positive both G 1 and G 2 must be non-negative. This implies that rOxo must lie between 0 
and /2. Because the conductance G O is non-negative, ,2 >_ 2 + 2coSrOxo + sint0xo. 
Figure 4 shows the range of center frequencies tOxo (normalized by  ) and relative band- 
widths (2,/tOxo) achievable by this realization. Not all bandwidths are achievable for 
(Oxo < 2atan0.5 -- 0.3.

4 TEST RESULTS 
The circuit architecture and CMOS building blocks described above were fabricated using 
the Orbit 2gm n-well process available through MOSIS. In this prototype, a 13 cell one 
dimensional array was fabricated on a 2.2mm square die. The value of t0xo is fixed at 
2 atan0.5 -- 0.927 by transistor sizing. This is the smallest spatial frequency for which all 
bandwidths can be obtained. In addition, G O = ,2 for this value of tOxo. The width of the 
impulse response is adjustable by changing the externally supplied bias current shown in
