Abstract 
Most theoretical and empirical studies of population codes make 
the assumption that underlying neuronal activities is a unique and 
unambiguous value of an encoded quantity. However, population 
activities can contain additional information about such things as 
multiple values of or uncertainty about the quantity. We have pre- 
viously suggested a method to recover extra information by treat- 
ing the activities of the population of cells as coding for a com- 
plete distribution over the coded quantity rather than just a single 
value. We now show how this approach bears on psychophys- 
ical and neurophysiological studies of population codes for mo- 
tion direction in tasks involving transparent motion stimuli. We 
show that, unlike standard approaches, it is able to recover mul- 
tiple motions from population responses, and also that its output 
is consistent with both correct and erroneous human performance 
on psychophysical tasks. 
A population code can be defined as a set of units whose activities collectively 
encode some underlying variable (or variables). The standard view is that popu- 
lation codes are useful for accurately encoding the underlying variable when the 
individual units are noisy. Current statistical approaches to interpreting popula- 
tion activity reflect this view, in that they determine the optimal single value that 
explains the observed activity pattern given a particular model of the noise (and 
possibly a loss function). 
In our work, we have pursued an alternative hypothesis, that the population en- 
codes additional information about the underlying variable, including multiple 
values and uncertainty. The Distributional Population Coding (DPC) framework 
finds the best probability distribution across values that fits the population activity 
(Zemel, Dayan, & Pouget, 1998). 
The DPC framework is appealing since it makes clear how extra information can 
be conveyed in a population code. In this paper, we use it to address a particu-

lar body of experimental data on transparent motion perception, due to Treue and 
colleagues (Hol & Treue, 1997; Rauber & Treue, 1997). These transparent motion 
experiments provide an ideal test of the DPC framework, in that the neurophysio- 
logical data reveal how the population responds to multiple values in the stimuli, 
and the psychophysical data describe how these values are actually decoded, pu- 
tatively from the population response. We investigate how standard methods fare 
on these data, and compare their performance to that of DPC. 
1 RESPONSES TO MULTIPLE MOTIONS 
Many investigators have examined neural and behavioral responses to stimuli 
composed of two patterns sliding across each other. These often create the im- 
pression of two separate surfaces moving in different directions. The general neu- 
rophysiological finding is that an MT cell's response to these stimuli can be char- 
acterized as the average of its responses to the individual components (van Wezel 
et al., 1996; Recanzone et al., 1997). As an example, Figure 1 shows data obtained 
from single-cell recordings in MT to random dot patterns consisting of two distinct 
motion directions (Treue, personal communication). Each plot is for a different rel- 
ative angle (A0) between the two directions. A plot can equivalently be viewed 
as the response of an population of MT cells having different preferred directions 
to a single presentation of a stimulus containing two directions. If A0 is large, the 
activity profile is bimodal, but as the directional difference shrinks, the profile be- 
comes unimodal. The population response to a A0 = 30 � motion stimulus is merely 
a wider version of the response to a stimulus containing a single direction of mo- 
tion. However, this transition from a bimodal to unimodal profiles in MT does not 
apparently correspond to subjects' percepts; subjects can reliably perceive both 
motions in superimposed transparent random patterns down to an angle of 10 � 
(Mather & Moulden, 1983). If these MT activities play a determining role in mo- 
tion perception, the challenge is to understand how the visual system can extract

2 ENCODING & DECODING 
Statistical population code decoding methods begin with the knowledge, collected 
over many experimental trials, of the tuning function fi(O) for each cell i, deter- 
mined using simple stimuli (e.g., ones containing uni-directional motion). Fig- 
ure 2A cartoons the framework used for standard decoding. Starting on the bot- 
tom left, encod'mg consists of taking a value 0 to be coded and representing it by 
the noisy activities ri of the elements of a population code. In the simulations de- 
scribed here, we have used a population of 200 model MT cells, with ttming func- 
tions defined by random sampling within physiologically-determined ranges for 
the parameters: baseline b, amplitude a and width or. The encoding model comes 
from the MT data: for a single motion, (ri[O) -- fi(O) = bi +ai x exp[-(O-0i) 2/2cri2], 
1 
while for two motions, <rilOl,02) =  [fi(01) + fi(02)]. The noise is taken to be in- 
dependent and Poisson. 
Standard Bayesian decoding starts with the activities r = {ri } and generates a dis- 
tribution v[Olr ]. Under the model with Poisson noise,

This method thus provides a multiplicative kernel density estimate, tending to 
produce a sharp distribution for a single motion direction 0. A single estimate 
can be extracted from T'[01r ] using a loss function. 
For this method to decode successfully when there are two motions in the input 
(0 and 02), the extracted distribution must at least have two modes. Standard 
Bayesian decoding fails to satisfy this requirement. First, if the response profile 
r is unimodal (cf. the 30 � plot in Figure 1), convolution with unimodal kernels 
{log fi(O)} produces a unimodal logV[0[r], peaked about the average of the two

directions. The additive kernel density estimate, an alternative distributional de- 
coding method proposed by Anderson (1995), suffers from the same problem, and 
also fails to be adequately sharp for single value inputs. 
Surprisingly, the standard Bayesian decoding method also fails on bimodal re- 
sponse profiles. If the baseline response bi -- 0, then T'[0[r] is Gaussian, with 
mean Y,i riOi/Ei' ri, and variance 1/Ei ri/cri2 (Snippe, 1996; Zemel et al., 1998). 
If bi > 0, then, for the extracted distribution to have two modes in the appropriate 
positions, log[T'[0x [r]/T'[02 l r]] must be small. However, the variance of this quan- 
tity is i(ri) (log[fi(Ox)/fi(02)]) 2, which is much greater than 0 unless the tuning 
curves are so flat as to be able to convey only little information about the stimuli. 
Intuitively, the noise in the rates causes  ri log fi (0) to be greater around one of 
the two values, and exponentiating to form T'[0[r] selects out this one value. Thus 
the standard method can only extract one of the two motion components from the 
population responses to transparent motion. 
The distributional population coding method (Figure 2B) extends the standard en- 
coding model to allow r to depend on general v[0]: 
(1) 
Bayesian decoding takes the observed activities r and produces probability distri- 
butions over probability distributions over 0, v[12(0)It]. For simplicity, we decode 
using an approximate form of maximum likelihood in distributions over 0, finding 
^ 
the 7 r (0) that maximizes L [T'(0)[r] --, Y4 ri log [fi(O) * T>(0)] -- ag IT>(0)] where the 
smoothness term g[] acts as a regularizer. 
The distributional encoding operation in Equation 1 is quite straightforward - by 
design, since this represents an assumption about what neural processing prior to 
(in this case) MT performs. However, the distributional decoding operation that 
we have used (Zemel et al., 1998) involves complicated and non-neural opera- 
tions. The idea is to understand what information in principle may be conveyed 
by a population code under this interpretation, and then to judge actual neural 
operations in the light of this theoretical optimum. DPC is a statistical cousin of 
so-called line-element models, which attempt to account for subjects' performance 
in cases like transparency using the output of some fixed number of direction- 
selective mechanisms (Williams et al., 1991). 
3 DECODING MULTIPLE MOTIONS 
We have applied our model to simulated MT response patterns r generated via 
the DPC encoding model (Equation 1). For multiple motion stimuli, with v(0) = 
(6(0 - 01) + 6(0 - 02))/2, this encoding model produces the observed
