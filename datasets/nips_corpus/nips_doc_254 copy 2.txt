ABSTRACT 
The existence of modularity in the organization of nervous systems 
(e.g. cortical columns and olfactory glomeruli) is well known. We 
show that localized activity patterns in a layer of cells, collective 
excitations, can induce the formation of modular structures in the 
anatomical connections via a Hebbian learning mechanism. The 
networks are spatially homogeneous before learning, but the spon- 
taneous emergence of localized collective excitations and subse- 
quently modularity in the connection patterns breaks translational 
symmetry. This spontaneous symmetry breaking phenomenon is 
similar to those which drive pattern formation in reaction-diffusion 
systems. We have identified requirements on the patterns of lateral 
connections and on the gains of internal units which are essential 
for the development of modularity. These essential requirements 
will most likely remain operative when more complicated (and bi- 
ologically realistic) models are considered.

I Modularity in Nervous Systems 
Modular organization exists throughout the nervous system on many different spa- 
tial scales. On the very small scale, synapses appear to be clustered on dendrites. 
On the very large scale, the brain as a whole is composed of many anatomically 
and functionally distinct regions. At intermediate scales, the scales of networks and 
maps, the brain exhibits columnar structures. 
The purpose of this work is to suggest possible mechanisms for the development 
of modular structures at the intermediate scales of networks and maps. The best 
known modular structure at this scale is the column. Many modality- specific 
variations of columnar organization are known, for example orientation selective 
columns, ocular dominance columns, color sensitive blobs, somatosensory barrels, 
and olfactory glomeruli. In addition to these anatomically well-established struc- 
tures, other more speculative modular anatomical structures may exist. These 
include the frontal eye fields of association cortex whose modular structure is in- 
ferred only from electrophysiology and the hypothetical existence of minicolumns 
and possibly neuronal groups. 
Although a complete biophysical picture of the development of modular structures 
is still unavailable, it is well established that electrical activity is crucial for the 
development of certain modular structures such as complex synaptic zones and oc- 
ular dominance columns (see Kalil 1989 and references therein). It is also generally 
conjectured that a Hebb-like mechanism is operative in this development. These 
observations form a basis for our operating hypothesis described below. 
2 Operating Hypothesis and Modeling Approach 
Our hypothesis in this work is that localized activity patterns in a layer of cells 
induce the development of modular anatomical structure within the layer. We 
further hypothesize that the emergence of localized activity patterns in a layer is 
due to the properties of the intrinsic network dynamics and does not necessarily 
depend upon the system receiving localized patterns of afferent activity. 
Our work therefore has two parts. First, we show that localized patterns of ac- 
tivity on a preferred spatial scale, collective excitations, spontaneously emerge in 
homogeneous networks with appropriate lateral connectivity and cellular response 
properties when driven with arbitrary stimulus (see Moody 1990). Secondly, we 
show that these collective excitations induce the formation of modular structures 
in the connectivity patterns when coupled to a Hebbian learning mechanism. 
The emergence of collective excitations at a preferred spatial scale in a homogeneous 
network breaks translational symmetry and is an example of spontaneous symmetry 
breaking. The Hebbian learning freezes the modular structure into the anatomy. 
The time scale of collective excitations is short, while the Hebbian learning process 
occurs over a longer time scale. The spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism is 
similar to that which drives pattern formation in reaction-diffusion systems (Turing 
1952, Meinhardt 1982). Reaction-diffusion models have been applied to pattern for-

mation in both biological and physical systems. One of the best known applications 
is to the development of zebra stripes and leopard spots. Also, a network model 
with dynamics exhibiting spontaneous symmetry breaking has been proposed by 
Cowan (1982) to explain geometrical visual hallucination patterns. 
Previous work by Pearson et al. (1987) demonstrated empirically that modularity 
emerged in simulations of an idealized but rather complex model of somatosensory 
cortex. The Pearson work was purely empirical and did not attempt to analyze 
theoretically why the modules developed. It provided an impetus, however, for our 
developing the theoretical results which we present here and in Moody (1990). 
Our work is thus intended to provide a possible theoretical foundation for the de- 
velopment of modularity. We have limited our attention to simple models which 
we can analyze mathematically in order to identify the essential requirements for 
the formation of modules. To convince ourselves that both collective excitations 
and the consequent development of modules are somewhat universal, we have con- 
sidered several different network models. All models exhibit collective excitations. 
We believe that more biologically realistic (and therefore more complicated) models 
will very likely exhibit similar behaviors. 
This paper is a substantially abbreviated version of Chernjavsky and Moody (1990). 
3 Network Dynamics: Collective Excitations 
The analysis of network dynamics presented in this section is adapted from Moody 
(1990). Due to space limitations, we present here a detailed analysis of only the 
simplest model which exhibits collective excitations. 
All network models which we consider possess a single layer of receptor cells which 
provide input to a single internal layer of laterally-connected cells. Two general 
classes of models are considered (see figure 1): additive models and shunting in- 
hibition models. The additive models contain a single population of internal cells 
which make both lateral excitatory and inhibitory connections. Both connection 
types are additive. The shunting inhibition models have two populations of cells 
in the internal layer: excitatory cells which make additive synaptic axonal contact 
with other cells and inhibitory cells which shunt the activities of excitatory cells.

The additive models are further subdivided into models with linear internal units 
and models with nonlinear (particularly sigmoidal) internal units. The shunting 
inhibition models have linear excitatory units and sigmoidal inhibitory units. We 
have considered two variants of the shunting models, those with and without lateral 
excitatory connections. 
For simplicity and tractability, we have limited the use of nonlinear response func- 
tions to at most one cell population in all models. More elaborate network models 
could make greater use of nonlinearity, a greater variety of cell types (eg. disin- 
hibitory cells), and use more ornate connectivity patterns. However, such additional 
structure can only add richness to the network behavior and is not likely to remove 
the collective excitation phenomenon. 
3.1 Dynamics for the Linear Additive Model 
To elucidate the fundamental requirements for the spontaneous emergence of col- 
lective excitations, we now focus on the minimal model which exhibits the phe- 
nomenon, the linear additive model. This model is exactly solvable. 
As we will see, collective excitations will emerge provided that the appropriate 
lateral connectivity patterns are present and that the gains of the internal units are 
suciently high. These basic requirements will carry over to the nonlinear additive 
and shunting models. 
The network relaxation equations for the linear additive model are:

where R i and E i are the activities (firing rates) of the jth receptor and internal

cells respectively, V/ is the somatic potential of the i tn internal cell, W'if! and 
W? are the afferent and lateral connections respectively, and 'd is the dynamical 
relaxation time. The somatic potentials and firing rates of the internal units are 
linearly related by Ei - (Vi - 0)/ where 0 is an offset or threshold and e-i is the 
gain. 
The steady state solutions of the network equations can be solved exactly by refor- 
mulating the problem in the continuum limit (i -+ x):
