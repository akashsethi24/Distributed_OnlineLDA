Abstract 
This paper outlines a dynamic theory of development and adap- 
tation in neural networks with feedback connections. Given in- 
put ensemble, the connections change in strength according to an 
associative learning rule and approach a stable state where the 
neuronal outputs are decorrelated. We apply this theory to pri- 
mary visual cortex and examine the implications of the dynamical 
decorrelation of the activities of orientation selective cells by the 
intracortical connections. The theory gives a unified and quantita- 
tive explanation of the psychophysical experiments on orientation 
contrast and orientation adaptation. Using only one parameter, we 
achieve good agreements between the theoretical predictions and 
the experimental data. 
I Introduction 
The mammalian visual system is very effective in detecting the orientations of lines 
and most neurons in primary visual cortex selectively respond to oriented lines and 
form orientation columns [1]. Why is the visual system organized as such? We

believe that the visual system is self-organized, in both long term development and 
short term adaptation, to ensure the optimal information processing. 
Linsker applied Hebbian learning to model the development of orientation selectiv- 
ity and later proposed a principle of maximum information preservation in early 
visual pathways [2]. The focus of his work has been on the feedforward connections 
and in his model the feedback connections are isotropic and unchanged during the 
development of orientation columns; but the actual circuitry of visual cortex in- 
volves extensive, columnar specified feedback connections which exist even before 
functional columns appear in cat striate cortex [3]. 
Our earlier research emphasized the important role of the feedback connections in 
the development of the columnar structure in visual cortex. We developed a the- 
oretical framework to help understand the dynamics of Hebbian learning in feed- 
back networks and showed how the columnar structure originates from symmetry 
breaking in the development of the feedback connections (intracortical, or lateral 
connections within visual cortex) [4]. 
Figure 1 illustrates our theoretical predictions. The intracortical connections break 
symmetry and develop strip-like patterns with a characteristic wave length which 
is comparable to the developed intracortical inhibitory range and the LGN-cortex 
afferent range (left). The feedforward (LGN-cortex) connections develop under the 
influence of the symmetry breaking development of the intracortical connections. 
The developed feedforward connections for each cell form a receptive field which 
is orientation selective and nearby cells have similar orientation preference (right). 
Their orientations change in about the same period as the strip-like pattern of the 
intracortical connections. 
Figure 1: The results of the development of visual cortex with feedback colmections. The 
simulated cortex colmists of 48 x 48 neurons, each of which connects to 5 x 5 other cortical 
neurons (left) and receives inputs from 7 x 7 LGN neurons (right). In this figure, white 
indicates positive connections and black indicates negative connections. One can see that 
the change of receptive field's orientation (right) is highly correlated with the strip-like 
pattern of intracortical connections (left). 
Many aspects of our theoretical predictions agree qualitatively with neurobiologi- 
cal observations in primary visual cortex. Another way to test the idea of optimal 
Associative Correlation Dynamics 927 
information processing or any self-organization theory is through quantitative psy- 
chophysical studies. The idea is to look for changes in perception following changes 
in input environments. The psychophysical experiments on orientation illusions 
offer some opportunities to test our theory on orientation selectivity. 
Orientation illusions are the effects that the perceived orientations of lines are af- 
fected by the neighboring (in time or space) oriented stimuli, which have been 
observed in many psychophysical experiments and were attributed to the inhibitory 
interactions between channels tuned to different orientations [5]. But there is no uni- 
fied and quantitative explanation. Neurophysiological evidences support our earlier 
computational model in which intracortical inhibition plays the role of gain-control 
in orientation selectivity [6]. But in order for the gain-control mechanism to be 
effective to signals of different statistics, the system has to develop and adapt in 
different environments. 
In this paper we examine the implication of the hypothesis that the intracortical 
connections dynamically decorrelate the activities of orientation selective cells, i.e., 
the intracortical connections are actively adapted to the visual environment, such 
that the output activities of orientation selective cells are decorrelated. The dynam- 
ics which ensures such decorrelation through associative learning is outlined in the 
next section as the theoretical framework for the development and the adaptation 
of intracortical connections. We only emphasize the feedback connections in the 
following sections and assume that the feedforward connections developed orienta- 
tion selectivities based on our earlier works. The quantitative comparisons of the 
theory and the experiments are presented in section 3. 
2 Associative Decorrelation Dynamics 
There are two different kinds of variables in neural networks. One class of variables 
represents the activity of the nerve cells, or neurons. The other class of variables 
describes the synapses, or connections, between the nerve cells. A complete model 
of an adaptive neural system requires two sets of dynamical equations, one for each 
class of variables, to specify the evolution and behavior of the neural system. 
The set of equations describing the change of the state of activity of the neurons is 
d� 
a d'--- Vi+ETijVj+Ii (1) 
in which a is a time constant, Tij is the strength of the synaptic connection from 
neuron j to neuron i, and Ii is the additional feedforward input to the neuron besides 
those described by the feedback connection matrix T/1. A second set of equations 
describes the way the synapses change with time due to neuronal activity. The 
learning rule proposed here is 
B dTj 
dt = (� - V[)Ij (2) 
in which B is a time constant and V[ is the feedback learning signal as described 
in the following. 
The feedback learning signal V/ is generated by a Hopfield type associative memory 
network: V/' = ]]j T[j V, in which T[ is the strength of the associative connection 
928 Dawei W. Dong 
from neuron j to neuron i, which is the recent correlation between the neuronal 
activities � and 1 determined by Hebbian learning with a decay term [4] 
B' dTitj 
dt= -% + �1 (3) 
in which B' is a time constant. The V/' and T[j are only involved in learning and 
do not directly affect the network outputs. 
It is straight forward to show that when the time constants B >> B' >> a, the 
dynamics reduces to 
dT= (1- < VV ' >) < VI ' > (4) 
B dt 
where bold-faced quantities are matrices and vectors and <> denotes ensemble 
average. It is not difficult to show that this equation has a Lyapunov or energy 
function 
L = Tr(1- < VV T >)(1- < VV ' >)T (5) 
which is lower bounded and satisfies 
dL dL 
< 0 and 
dt - dt 
Thus the dynamics is stable. 
lated, 
dTij 
=0 - d--'-=0 for alli, j (6) 
When it is stable, the output activities are decorre- 
< vv r >= 1 (7) 
The above equation shows that this dynamics always leads to a stable state where 
the neuronal activities are decorrelated and their correlation matrix is orthonormal. 
Yet the connections change in an associative fashion equation (2) and (3) are 
almost Hebbian. That is why we call it associative decorrelation dynamics. From in- 
formation processing point of view, a network, self-organized to satisfy equation (7), 
is optimized for Gaussian input ensembles and white output noises [7]. 
Linear First Order Analysis 
In applying our theory of associative decorrelation dynamics to visual cortex to 
compare with the psychophysical experiments on orientation illusions, the linear 
first-order approximation is used, which is 
T=T�+ST, T�=O, 5To(-<IIT> 
V=V �+Sv, V �=I, 5V=TI (8) 
where it is assumed that the input correlations are small. It is interesting to notice 
that the linear first-order approximation leads to anti-Hebbian feedback connec- 
tions: Tij  - < Iilj > which is guarantteed to be stable around T = 0 [8]. 
3 Quantitative Predictions of Orientation Illusions 
The basic phenomena of orientation illusions are demonstrated in figure 2 (left). 
On the top, is the effect of orientation contrast (also called tilt illusion): within the 
two surrounding circles there are tilted lines; the orientation of a center rectangle 
Associative Correlation Dynamics 929 
appears rotated to the opposite side of its surrounding tilt. Both the two rectan- 
gles and the one without surround (at the left-center of this figure) are, in fact, 
exactly same. On the bottom, is the effect of orientation adaptation (also called 
tilt aftereffect): if one fixates at the small circle in one of the two big circles with 
tilted lines for 20 seconds or so and then look at the rectangle without surround, 
the orientation of the lines of the rectangle appears tilted to the opposite side. 
These two effects of orientation illusions are both in the direction of repulsion: the 
apparent orientation of a line is changed to increase its difference from the inducing 
line. Careful experimental measurements also reve
