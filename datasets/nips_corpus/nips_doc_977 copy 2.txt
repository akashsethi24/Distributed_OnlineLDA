Abstract 
We implement and study a computational model of Stevens' [1992] 
theory of the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. This theory hypoth- 
esizes that the onset of schizophrenia is associated with reactive 
synaptic regeneration occurring in brain regions receiving degener- 
ating temporal lobe projections. Concentrating on one such area, 
the frontal cortex, we model a frontal module as an associative 
memory neural network whose input synapses represent incoming 
temporal projections. We analyze how, in the face of weakened 
external input projections, compensatory strengthening of internal 
synaptic connections and increased noise levels can maintain mem- 
ory capacities (which are generally preserved in schizophrenia). 
However, These compensatory changes adversely lead to sponta- 
neous, biased retrieval of stored memories, which corresponds to 
the occurrence of schizophrenic delusions and hallucinations with- 
out any apparent external trigger, and for their tendency to con- 
centrate on just few central themes. Our results explain why these 
symptoms tend to wane as schizophrenia progresses, and why de- 
layed therapeutical intervention leads to a much slower response.

1 Introduction 
There has been a growing interest in recent years in the use of neural models to inves- 
tigate various brain pathologies and their cognitive and behavioral effects. Recent 
published examples of such studies include models of cortical plasticity following 
stroke, Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia, and cognitive and behavioral explo- 
rations of aphasia, acquired dyslexia and affective disorders (reviewed in [1, 2]). 
Continuing this line of study, we present a computational account linking specific 
pathological synaptic changes that are postulated to occur in schizophrenia, and 
the emergence of schizophrenic delusions and hallucinations. The latter symptoms 
denote persistent, unrealistic, psychotic thoughts (delusions) or percepts (halluci- 
nations) that may at times flood the patient in an overwhelming, stressful manner. 
The wealth of data gathered concerning the pathophysiology of schizophrenia sup- 
ports the involvement of both the frontal and the temporal lobes. On the one 
hand, there are atrophic changes in the hippocampus and parahippocampal areas 
including neuronal loss and gliosis. On the other hand, neurochemical and morpho- 
metric studies testify to an expansion of various receptor binding sites and increased 
dendritic branching in the frontal cortex of schizophrenics. Stevens has recently pre- 
sented a theory linking these temporal and frontal findings, claiming that the onset 
of schizophrenia is associated with reactive anomalous sprouting and synaptic re- 
organization taking place in the projection sites of degenerating temporal neurons, 
including (among various cortical and subcortical structures) the frontal lobes [3]. 
This paper presents a computational study of Stevens' theory. Within the frame- 
work of a memory model of hippocampal-frontal interaction, we show that the 
introduction of the 'microscopic' synaptic changes that underlie Stevens' hypothe- 
sis can help preserve memory function but results in specific 'pathological' changes 
in the 'macroscopic' behavior of the network. A small subset of the patterns stored 
in the network are now spontaneously retrieved at times, without being cued by any 
specific input pattern. This emergent behavior shares some of the important char- 
acteristics of schizophrenic delusions and hallucinations, which frequently appear in 
the absence of any apparent external trigger, and tend to concentrate on a limited 
set of recurrent themes [4]. Memory capacities are fairly preserved in schizophren- 
ics, until late stages of the disease [5]. In Section 2 we present our model. The 
analytical and numerical results obtained are described in Section 3, followed by 
our conclusions in Section 4. 
2 The Model 
As illustrated in Figure 1, we model a frontal module as an associative memory 
attractor neural network, receiving its input memory cues from decaying exter- 
nal input fibers (representing the degenerating temporal projections). The net- 
work's internal connections, which store the memorized patterns, undergo synaptic 
strengthening changes that model the reactive synaptic regeneration within the 
frontal module. The effect of other diffuse external projections is modeled as back- 
ground noise. A frontal module represents a macro-columnar unit that has been 
suggested as a basic functional building block of the neocortex [6]. The assumption 
that memory retrieval from the frontal cortex is invoked by the firing of incoming

temporal projections is based on the notion that temporal structures have an im- 
portant role in establishing long-term memory in the neocortex and in the retrieval 
of facts and events (e.g., [7]).

Figure 1: A schematic illustration of the model. A frontal module is modeled 
as an attractor neural network whose neurons receive inputs via three kinds of 
connections: internal connections from other frontal neurons, external connections 
from temporal lobe neurons, and diffuse external connections from other cortical 
modules, modeled as noise. 
The attractor network we use is a biologically-motivated variant of Hopfield's ANN 
model, proposed by Tsodyks & Feigel'man [8]. Each neuron i is described by a 
binary variable $i = {1,0) denoting an active (firing) or passive (quiescent) state, 
respectively. M = cN distributed memory patterns  are stored in the network. 
The elements of each memory pattern are chosen to be i (0) with probability p 
(1-p) respectively, with p << 1. All N neurons in the network have a fixed uniform 
threshold 0. 
In its initial, undamaged state, the weights of the internal synaptic connections are 
M 
co Z(, i _ P)(J - P)' (1) 
Wij= 
/=1 
where co = 1. The post-synaptic potential (input field) hi of neuron i is the sum of 
internal contributions from other neurons and external projections Fi e 
hi(t) = Z wijsj(t - 1)+ 
(2) 
The updating rule for neuron i at time t is given by

Si(t) = O, otherwise

where G is the sigmoid function G(x) = 1/(1 +exp(-x/T)), and T denotes the noise 
level. The activation level of the stored memories is measured by their overlaps 
with the current state of the network, defined by 
N 
i E(_p)Si(t) ' 
rn(t) = p(1 - p)N i=1 
(4) 
Stimulus-dependent retrieval is modeled by orienting the field F* with one of the 
memorized patterns (the cued pattern, say ix), such that 
Fi e -- e.x i , (e  0) . (5) 
Following the presentation of an external input cue, the network state evolves until 
it converges to a stable state. The network parameters are tuned such that in its 
initial, undamaged state it correctly retrieves the cued patterns (e0 = 0.035, co = 1, 
T = 0.005). 
We also examine the network's behavior in the absence of any specific stimulus. The 
network may either continue to wander around in a state of random low baseline 
activity, or it may converge onto a stored memory state. We refer to the latter 
process as spontaneous retrieval. 
Our investigation of Stevens' work proceeds in two stages. First we examine and an- 
alyze the behavior of the network when it undergoes uniform synaptic changes that 
represent the pathological changes occurring in accordance with Stevens' theory. 
These include the weakening of external input projections (e ) and the increase in 
the internal projections (c ]') and noise levels (T ]'). In the second stage, we add 
the assumption that the internal synaptic compensatory changes have an additional 
Hebbian activity-dependent component, and examine the effect of the rule 
W,j(t) = W,j(t - l) + (, - p)(j - p) , (6) 
where  is 1 (0) only if neuron k has been consecutively firing (quiescent) for the 
last r iterations, and ? is a constant. 
3 Results 
We now show some simulation and analytic results, examining the effects of the 'mi- 
croscopic' pathological changes, taking place in accordance with Stevens' theory, on 
the 'macroscopic' behavior of the network. The analytical results presented have 
been derived by calculating the magnitude of randomly formed initial 'biases', and 
comparing their effect on the network's dynamics versus the effect of externally pre- 
sented input cues. This comparison is performed by formulating a corresponding 
overlap master equation, whose fixed point dynamics are investigated via phase- 
plane analysis, as described in [9]. First, we study whether the reactive synaptic 
changes (occurring in both internal and external, diffuse synapses) are really com- 
pensatory, i.e., to what extent can they help maintaining memory capacities in the 
face of degenerating external input synapses. As illustrated in Figure 2, we find that 
increased noise levels can (up to some degree) preserve memory retrieval in the face 
of decreased external input strength. Increased synaptic strengthening preserves
