Abstract 
The goal of perception is to extract invariant properties of the underly- 
ing world. By computing contrast at edges, the retina reduces incident 
light intensities spanning twelve decades to a twentyfold variation. In one 
stroke, it solves the dynamic range problem and extracts relative reflec- 
tivity, bringing us a step closer to the goal. We have built a contrast- 
sensitive silicon retina that models all major synaptic interactions in the 
outer-plexiform layer of the vertebrate retina using current-mode CMOS 
circuits: namely, reciprocal synapses between cones and horizontal cells, 
which produce the antagonistic center/surround receptive field, and cone 
and horizontal cell gap junctions, which determine its size. The chip has 
90 x 92 pixels on a 6.8 x 6.9mm die in 2pm n-well technology and is fully 
functional. 
I INTRODUCTION 
Retinal cones use both intracellular and extracellular mechanisms to adapt their 
gain to the input intensity level and hence remain sensitive over a large dynamic 
range. For example, photochemical processes within the cone modulate the pho- 
tocurrents while shunting inhibitory feedback from the network adjusts its mem- 
brane conductance. Adaptation makes the light sensitivity inversely proportional 
to the recent input level and the membrane conductance proportional to the back- 
ground intensity. As a result, the cone's membrane potential is proportional to the 
ratio between the input and its spatial or temporal average, i.e. contrast. We have

developed a contrast-sensitive silicon retina using shunting inhibition. 
This silicon retina is the first to include variable inter-receptor coupling, allowing 
one to trade-off resolution for enhanced signal-to-noise ratio, thereby revealing 
low-contrast stimuli in the presence of large transistor mismatch. In the vertebrate 
retina, gap junctions between photoreceptors perform this function [5]. At these 
specialized synapses, pores in the cell membranes are juxtaposed, allowing ions 
to diffuse directly from one cell to another [6]. Thus, each receptor's response is a 
weighted average over a local region. The signal-to-noise ratio increases for features 
larger than this region--in direct proportion to the space constant [5]. 
Our chip achieves a four-fold improvement in density over previous designs [2]. 
We use innovative current-mode circuits [7] that provide very high functionality 
while faithfully modeling the neurocircuitry. A bipolar phototransistor models the 
photocurrents supplied by the outer-segment of the cone. We use a novel single- 
transistor implementation of gap junctions that exploits the physics of MOS tran- 
sistors. Chemical synapses are also modeled very efficiently with a single device. 
Mahowald and Mead's pioneering silicon retina [2] coded the logarithm of contrast. 
However, a logarithmic encoding degrades the signal-to-noise ratio because large 
signals are compressed more than smaller ones. Mead et. al. have subsequently 
improved this design by including network-level adaptation [4] and adaptive pho- 
toreceptors [3, 4] but do not implement shunting inhibition. Our silicon retina was 
designed to encode contrast directly using shunting inhibition. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The neurocircuitry of the 
distal retina is described in Section 2. Diffusors and the contrast-sensitive sili- 
con retina circuit are featured in Section 3. We show that a linearized version of 
this circuit computes the regularized solution for edge detection. Responses from a 
one-dimensional retina showing receptive field organization and contrast sensitiv- 
ity, and images from the two-dimensional chip showing spatial averaging and edge 
enhancement are presented in Section 4. Section 5 concludes the paper.

2 THE RETINA 
The outer plexiform layer of the retina produces the well-known antagonistic cen- 
ter/surround receptive field organization first described in detail by Kuttter in the 
cat [11]. The functional neurocircuitry, based on the red cone system in the tur- 
tle [10, 8, 6], is shown in Figure 1. Cones and horizontal cells are coupled by gap 
junctions, forming two syncytia within which signals diffuse freely. The gap junc- 
tions between horizontal cells are larger in area (larger number of elementary pores), 
so signals diffuse relatively far in the horizontal cell syncytium. On the other hand, 
signals diffuse poorly in the cone syncytium and therefore remain relatively strong 
locally. When light falls on a cone, its activity increases and it excites adjacent hor- 
izontal cells which reciprocate with inhibition. Due to the way signals spread, the 
excitation received by nearby cones is stronger than the inhibition from horizontal 
cells, producing net excitation in the center. Beyond a certain distance, however, 
the reverse is true and so there is net inhibition in the surround. 
The inhibition from horizontal cells is of the shunting kind and this gives rise to 
to contrast sensitivity. Horizontal cells depolarize the cones by closing chloride 
channels while light hyperpolarizes them by closing sodium channels [9, 1]. The 
cone's membrane potential is given by 
V = gv,,Ev,, + gDV. 
gv,, + gc + gD

where the conductances are proportional to the number of channels that are open 
and voltages are referred to the reversal potential for chloride. gD and V, et describe 
the effect of gap junctions to neighboring cones. Since the horizontal cells pool 
signals over a relatively large area, got will depend on the background intensity. 
Therefore, the membrane voltage will be proportional to the ratio between the 
input, which determines gN,, and the background.

In the subthreshold region of operation, a MOS transistor mimics the behavior of a 
gap junction. Current flows by diffusion: the current through the channel is linearly 
proportional to the difference in carrier concentrations across it [2]. Therefore, the 
channel is directly analogous to a porous membrane and carrier concentration is the 
analog of ionic species concentration. In conformity with the underlying physics, we 
call transistors in this novel mode of operation diffusors. The gate modulates the 
carrier concentrations at the drain and the source multiplicatively and therefore sets 
the diffusivity. In addition to offering a compact gap junction with electronically 
adjustable 'area,' the diffusor has a large dynamic range--at least five decades. 
A current-mode diffusor circuit is shown in Figure 2a. The currents through the 
diode-connected well devices M1 and M2 are proportional to the carrier concen- 
trations at either end of the diffusor Ma. Consequently, the diffusor current is pro- 
portional to the current difference between M1 and M2. Starting with the equation 
describing subthreshold conduction [2, p. 36], we obtain an expression for the cur- 
rent IpQ in terms of the currents Ip and IQ, the reference voltage Vre! and the bias 
voltage V/: 
For simplicity, voltages and currents are in units of V- = kT/q, and I0, the zero 
bias current, respectively; all devices are assumed to have the same  and I0. The 
ineffectiveness of the gate in controlling the channel potential, measured by   0.?5, 
introduces a small nonideality. There is a direct analogy between this circuit and 
the resistive circuit shown in Figure 2b for which leo = (ff,/ffl)(IQ- Is,). The 
currents in these circuits are identical if G=/G1 = exp(Vz - Vrel) and  = 1. 
Increasing Vz or reducing Ve! has the same effect as increasing G= or reducing 
Chemical synapses are also modeled using a single MOS transistor. Synaptic inputs 
to the turtle cone have a much higher resistance, typically 0.6Gf or more [1], 
than the input conductance of a cone in the network which is 50M or less [8]. 
Thus the synaptic inputs are essentially current sources. This also holds true for 
horizontal cells which are even more tightly coupled. Accordingly, chemical synapses 
are modeled by a MOS transistor in saturation. In this regime, it behaves like 
current source driving the postsynapse controlled by a voltage in the presynapse. 
The same applies to the light-sensitive input supplied by the cone outer-segment; 
its peak conductance is about 0.4GF in the tiger salamander [9]. Therefore, the 
cone outer-segment is modeled by a bipolar phototransistor, also in saturation, 
which produces a current proportional to incident light intensity. 
Shunting inhibition is not readily realized in silicon because the 'synapses' are cur- 
rent sources. However, to first order, we achieve the same effect by modulating the 
gap junction diffusitivity gD (see Equation 1). In the silicon retina circuit, we set 
VL globally for a given diffusitivity and control V,,e! locally to implement shunting 
inhibition. 
A one-dimensional version of the current-mode silicon retina circuit is shown in 
Figure 3. This is a direct mapping of the neurocircuitry of the outer-plexiform 
layer (shown in Figure 1) onto silicon using one transistor per chemical synapse/gap 
junction.
