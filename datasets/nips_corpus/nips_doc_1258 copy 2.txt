Abstract 
We study the spatiotemporal correlation in natural time-varying 
images and explore the hypothesis that the visual system is con- 
cerned with the optimal coding of visual representation through 
spatiotemporal decorrelation of the input signal. Based on the 
measured spatiotemporal power spectrum, the transform needed to 
decorrelate input signal is derived analytically and then compared 
with the actual processing observed in psychophysical experiments. 
1 Introduction 
The visual system is concerned with the perception of objects in a dynamic world. 
A significant fact about natural time-varying images is that they do not change ran- 
domly over space-time; instead image intensities at different times and/or spatial 
positions are highly correlated. We measured the spatiotemporal correlation func- 
tion - equivalently the power spectrum - of natural images and we find that it is 
non-separable, i.e., coupled in space and time, and exhibits a very interesting scaling 
behaviour. When expressed as a function of an appropriately scaled frequency vari- 
able, the spatiotemporal power spectrum is given by a simple power-law. We point 
out that the same kind of spatiotemporal coupling and scaling exists in human vi- 
sual sensitivity measured in psychophysical experiments. This poses the intriguing 
question of whether there is a quantitative relationship between the power spectrum 
of natural images and visual sensitivity. We answer this question by showing that 
the latter can be predicted from measurements of the power spectrum.

2 Spatioternporal Coupling and Scaling 
Interest in properties of time-varying images dates back to the early days of develop- 
ment of the television [1]. But systematic studies have not been possible previously 
primarily due to technical obstacles, and our knowledge of the regularities of time- 
varying images has so far been very limited. 
Figure 1: Natural time-varying images are highly correlated in space and time. Shown on 
the top are two frames of a motion scene separated by thirty three milliseconds. These 
two frames are highly repetitive, in fact the light intensities of most corresponding pixels 
are similar. Shown on the bottom are light increase (on the left) and light decrease (on 
the right) between the above two snapshots indicated by greyscale of pixels (white means 
no change). One can immediately see that only a small portion of the image changes 
significantly over this time scale. Our methods have been described previously [3]. To 
summerize, more than one thousand segments of videos on 8ram video tape (NTSC format 
RGB) are digitized to 8 bits greyscale using a Silicon Graphics Video board with default 
factory settings. Two types of segments are analyzed. The first are segments from movies 
on video tapes (e.g. Raiders of the Lost Ark, Uncommon Valor). The second type of 
segments that we analyzed are videos made by the authors. The scene of the moving egret 
shown here is taken at Central Park in New York City. 
We have systematically measured the two point correlation matrix or covariance 
matrix of 10 � x 10 � x 2s (horizontalx vertical x temporal digitized to 64 x 64 x 64) seg- 
ments of natural time-varying images by averaging over 1049 movie segments. An 
example of two consecutive frames from a typical segment is given in Figure 1. The 
Fourier transform of the correlation matrix, or the power spectrum, turns out to 
be a non-separable function of spatial and temporal frequencies and exhibits an 
interesting scaling behaviour. From our measurements (see Figure 2) we find 
where f, is a scaled frequency which is simply the spatial frequency f scaled by 
G(w/.f), a function of the ratio of temporal and spatial frequencies, i.e., f, - 
G(w/.f).f. This behaviour is revealed most clearly by plotting the power spectrum 
as a function of f for fixed w/f ratio: the curves for different w/f ratios are just a 
horizontal shift from each other.

Figure 2: Spatiotemporal power spectra of natural time-varying images. (A) plotted as a 
function of spatial frequency for three temporal frequencies (0.9, 3, 10) Hz; (B) plotted for 
three velocities -- ratios of temporal and spatial frequencies -- (0.8, 2.3, 7) degree/second. 
There are some important conclusions that can be drawn from this measurement. First, 
it is obvious that the power spectrum cannot be separated into pure spatial and pure 
temporal parts; space and time are coupled in a non-trivial way. The power spectrum at 
low temporal frequency decreases more rapidly with increasing spatial frequency. Second, 
underlying this data is an interesting scaling behaviour which can be easily seen from the 
curves for constant w/f ratios: each curve is simply shifted horizontally from each other in 
the log-log plot. Thus curves for constant w/f ratio overlap with each other when shifted 
by an amount of G(w/f), i.e., when plotted against a scaled frequency fw = G(w/f)f. 
The similar spario-temporal coupling and scaling for hunam visual sensitivity is shown in 
Figure 3. 
Interestingly, the human visual system seems to be designed to take advantage 
of such regularity in natural images. The spatiotemporal contrast sensitivity of 
human K(f, w), i.e., the visual responses to a sinewave grating of spatial frequency 
f modulated at temporal frequency w, exhibits the same kind of spatiotemporal 
coupling and scaling (see Figure 3), 
K(f,w) = 
Again, when the contrast sensitivity curves are plotted as a function of f for fixed 
w/f ratios, the curves have the same shape and are only shifted from each other [2].

of spatial frequency for two temporal frequencies (2, 13) Hz; (B) plotted for two w/f 
ratios (0.15, 3) degree/second. The solid lines in both A and B are the empirical fits. 
The experimental data points and empirical fitting curves are from reference [2]. First, 
it can be seen that the human visual sensitivity curve is band-pass filter at low temporal 
frequency and approaches low-pass filter for higher temporal frequency. The space and 
time are coupled. Second, it is clear that the curves for different w/f ratios have the same 
shape and are only shifted horizontally from each other in the log-log plot. Again, curves 
for constant w/f ratio overlap with each other when shifted by an amount of G(w/f), 
i.e., when plotted against a scaled frequency fw = G(w/f)f. The similar behaviour of 
spatiotemporal coupling and scaling for the power spectra of natural images is shown in 
Figure 2.

3 Relative Motion of Visual Scene 
Why does the human visual sensitivity have the same spatiotemporal coupling and 
scaling as natural images? 
The intuition underlying the spatiotemporal coupling and scaling of natural images 
is that when viewing a real visual scene the natural eye and/or body movements 
translate the entire scene across the retina and every spatial Fourier component 
of the scene moves at the same velocity. Thus it is reasonable to assume that 
for constant velocity, i.e., w/f ratio, the power spectrum show the same universal 
behaviour. This assumption is tested quantitatively in the following. 
Our measurements reveal that the spatiotemporal power spectrum has a simple 
form 
R(fw)  
which is shown in Figure 6A. This behaviour can be accounted for if the dominant 
component in the temporal signal comes from motion of objects with static power 
spectra of Rs (f) f-2. The static power spectra for the same collection of images is 
measured by treating frames as snapshots (Figure 4A); the measurement confirmed 
the above assumption and is in agreement with earlier works on the statistical 
properties of static natural images [5, 6, 7]. 
It is easy to derive that for a rotationally symmetric static spectrum Rs (f) = K/f  
(K is a constant), the spatiotemporal power spectrum of moving images is 
K p(), (1) 
R(f, m) = 
where P() is the function of velocity distribution, which is shown as the solid curve 
in Figure 4B (measured independently from the optical flows between frames).

which the data of Figure 2 for the power spectrum were replotted as a function of w/f 
after multiplication by fs __ all the data points fall on the P(v) curve. 
In summary, the measured spatiotemporal power spectrum is dominated by images

Spatiotemporal Coupling/Scaling of Natural Images & Visual Sensitivity 863 
Based on the assumption that the visual system is optimized to transmit information 
from natural scenes, we have derived and pointed out in references [3, 4] that the 
spatiotemporal contrast sensitivity K is a function of the power spectrum R, and 
thus the spatiotemporal coupling and scaling of R of natural images translates 
directly t
