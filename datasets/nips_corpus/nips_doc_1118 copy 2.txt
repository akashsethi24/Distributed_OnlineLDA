Abstract 
We report on our development of a high-performance system for 
neural network and other signal processing applications. We have 
designed and implemented a vector microprocessor and pack- 
aged it as an attached processor for a conventional workstation. 
We present performance comparisons with commercial worksta- 
tions on neural network backpropagation training. The SPERT-II 
system demonstrates significant speedups over extensively hand- 
optimization code running on the workstations. 
I Introduction 
We are working on pattern recognition problems using neural networks with a large 
number of parameters. Because of the large computational requirements of our area 
of research, we set out to design an integrated circuit that would serve as a good 
building block for our systems. Initially we considered designing extremely special- 
ized chips, as this would maximize performance for a particular algorithm. However, 
the algorithms we use undergo considerable change as our research progresses. Still, 
we needed to provide some specialization if our design was to offer significant im- 
provement over commercial workstation systems. Competing with workstations is

a challenge to anyone designing custom programmable processors, but as will be 
shown in this paper, one can still provide a performance advantage by focusing on 
one general class of computation. 
Our solution was to design a vector microprocessor, TO, optimized for fixed-point 
computations, and to package this as an inexpensive workstation accelerator board. 
In this manner, we gain a considerable performance/cost advantage for neural net- 
work and other signal processing algorithms, while leveraging the commercial work- 
station environment for software development and I/O services. 
In this paper, we focus on the neural network applications of the SPERT-II system. 
We are also investigating other applications in the areas of human-machine interface 
and multimedia processing, as we believe vector microprocessors show promise in 
providing the flexible, cost-effective, high-performance computing required. 
Section 2 discusses the design of the hardware, followed in Section 3 by a discussion 
of the software environment we are developing and a discussion of related systems 
in Section 4. In Section 5 we discuss how we map a backpropagation training task 
to the system and in Section 6 we compare the resulting performance with two 
commercial workstation systems. 
2 SPERT-II System 
SPERT-II is a double slot SBus card for use in Sun compatible workstations and is 
shown in Figure 1. The board contains a TO vector microprocessor and its memory, 
a Xilinx FPGA device for interfacing with the host, and various system support 
devices.

2.1 The TO vector microprocessor 
Development of the TO vector microprocessor follows our earlier work on the original 
SPERT VLIW/SIMD neuro-microprocessor (Wawrzynek, 1993). The most signifi- 
cant change we have made to the architecture is to move to a vector instruction set 
architecture (ISA), based on the industry standard MIPS RISC scalar ISA (Kane, 
1992) extended with vector coprocessor instructions. The resulting ISA, which we 
call Torrent, offers important advantages over our previous design. We gain access to 
existing software tools for the MIPS architecture, including optimizing C compilers, 
assemblers, linkers, and debuggers. VLIW machines expose details of the hardware 
implementation at the instruction set level, and so must change instruction sets

hen scaling to higher degrees of on-chip parallelism. In contrast, vector ISAs pro- 
vide a simple abstraction of regular data parallelism that enables different hardware 
implementations to make different trade-offs between cost and performance while 
remaining software compatible. Compared with the VLIW/SIMD design, the vector 
ISA reduces requirements on instruction cache space and fetch bandwidth. It also 
makes it easier to write optimized library routines in assembly language, and these 
library routines will still run well on future devices with greater on-chip parallelism. 
In the design of the TO vector microprocessor, the main technique we employ to 
improve cost-performance over a commercial general purpose processor is to inte- 
grate multiple fixed-point datapaths with a high-bandwidth memory system. Fast 
digital arithmetic units, multipliers in particular, require chip area proportional to 
the square of the number of operand bits. In modern microprocessors and digital 
signal processors a single floating-point unit takes up a significant portion of the chip 
area. High-precision arithmetic units also requires high memory bandwidth to move 
large operands. However, for a wide class of problems, full-precision floating-point, 
or even high-precision fixed-point arithmetic, is not needed. Studies by ourselves 
and others have shown that for error back-propagation training of neural networks, 
16-bit weights and 8-bit activation values provide similar training performance to 
IEEE single-precision floating-point (Asanovid, 1991). 
However, fast fixed-point multiply-adds alone are not sufficient to increase perfor- 
mance on a wide range of problems. Other components of a complete application 
may dominate total compute time if only multiply-add operations are accelerated. 
Our processor integrates a fast general-purpose RISC core, and includes general 
purpose operations in its vector instruction set to obtain a balanced design. 
The TO processor is a complete single chip implementation of the Torrent archi- 
tecture. It was fabricated in Hewlett-Packard's CMOS26B process using 1.0ttm 
scalable CMOS design rules and two layers of metal. The die measures 16.75mm x 
16.75mm, and contains 730,701 transistors. TO runs at an internal clock rate of 
40MHz. 
The main components of TO are the MIPS-II compatible RISC CPU with an on- 
chip instruction cache, a vector unit coprocessor, a 128-bit wide external memory 
interface, and an 8-bit wide serial host interface (TSIP) and control unit. The 
external memory interface supports up to 4 GB of memory over a 128-bit wide data 
bus. The current SPERT-II board uses 16, 4 Mb SRAM parts to provide 8 MB of 
main memory. 
At the core of the TO processor is a MIPS-II compatible 32-bit integer RISC pro- 
cessor with a 1 KB instruction cache. The system coprocessor provides a 32-bit 
counter/timer and registers for host synchronization and exception handling. 
The vector unit contains a vector register file with 16 vector registers, each holding 
32 elements of 32 bits each, and three vector functional units, VP0, VP1, and 
VMP. VP0 and VP1 are vector arithmetic functional units. With the exception of 
multiplies, that must execute in VP0, either pipeline can execute any arithmetic 
operation. The multipliers perform 16-bit x 16-bit multiplies producing 32-bit 
results. All other arithmetic, logical and shift functions operate on 32 bits. VMP 
is the vector memory unit, and it handles all vector load/store operations, scalar 
load/store operations, and the vector insert/extract operations. 
All three vector functional units are composed of 8 parallel pipelines, and so can 
each produce up to 8 results per cycle. The TO memory interface has a single 
memory address port, therefore non-unit stride and indexed memory operations are 
limited to a rate of one element per cycle.

The elements of a vector register are striped across all 8 pipelines. With the max- 
imum vector length of 32, a vector functional unit can accept a new instruction 
every 4 cycles. TO can saturate all three vector functional units by issuing one 
instruction per cycle to each, leaving a single issue slot every 4 cycles for the scalar 
unit. In this manner, TO can sustain up to 24 operations per cycle. Several im- 
portant library routines, such as matrix-vector and matrix-matrix multiplies, have 
been written which achieve this level of performance. All vector pipeline hazards 
are fully interlocked in hardware, and so instruction scheduling is only required to 
improve performance, not to ensure correctness. 
3 SPERT-II Software Environment 
The primary design goal for the SPERT-II software environment was that it should 
appear as similar as possible to a conventional workstation environment. This 
should ease the task of porting existing workstation applications, as well as provide 
a comfortable environment for developing new code. 
The Torrent instruction set architecture is based on the MIPS-II instruction set, 
with extra coprocessor instructions added to access the vector unit functionality. 
This compatibility allows us to base our software environment on the GNU tools 
which already include support for MIPS based machines. We have ported the 
gee C/C++ compiler, modified the gdb symbolic debugger to debug TO programs 
remotely from the host, enhanced the gas assembler to understand the new vector 
instructions and to schedule code to avoid interlocks, and we also employ the GNU 
linker and other library management util
