Abstract 
Based on computational principles, the concept of an internal 
model for adaptive control has been divided into a forward and an 
inverse model. However, there is as yet little evidence that learning 
control by the CNS is through adaptation of one or the other. Here 
we examine two adaptive control architectures, one based only on 
the inverse model and other based on a combination of forward and 
inverse models. We then show that for reaching movements of the 
hand in novel force fields, only the learning of the forward model 
results in key characteristics of performance that match the kine- 
matics of human subjects. In contrast, the adaptive control system 
that relies only on the inverse model fails to produce the kinematic 
patterns observed in the subjects, despite the fact that it is more 
stable. Our results provide evidence that learning control of novel 
dynamics is via formation of a forward model. 
I Introduction 
The concept of an internal model, a system for predicting behavior of a controlled 
process, is central to the current theories of motor control (Wolpert et al. 1995) and 
learning (Shadmehr and Mussa-Ivaldi 1994). Theoretical studies have proposed 
that internal models may be divided into two varieties: forward models, which 
simulate the causal flow of a process by predicting its state transition given a motor 
command, and inverse models, which estimate motor commands appropriate for a 
desired state transition (Miall and Wolpert, 1996). This classification is relevant for 
adaptive control because based on computational principles, it has been proposed 
that learning control of a nonlinear system might be facilitated if a forward model 
of the plant is learned initially, and then during an off-line period is used to train 
an inverse model (Jordan and Rumelhart, 1992). While there is no experimental 
evidence for this idea in the central nervous system, there is substantial evidence

that learning control of arm movements involves formation of an internal model. 
For example, practicing arm movements while holding a novel dynamical system 
initiates an adaptation process which results in the formation of an internal model: 
upon sudden removal of the force field, after-effects are observed which match the 
expected behavior of a system that has learned to predict and compensate for the 
dynamics of the imposed field (Shadmehr and Brashers-Krug, 1997). However, the 
computational nature of this internal model, whether it be a forward or an inverse 
model, or a combination of both, is not known. 
Here we use a computational approach to examine two adaptive control architec- 
tures: adaptive inverse model feedforward control and adaptive forward-inverse 
model feedback control. We show that the two systems predict different behaviors 
when applied to control of arm movements. While adaptation to a force field is 
possible with either approach, the second system with feedback control through an 
adaptive forward model, is far less stable and is accompanied with distinct kinematic 
signatures, termed near path-discontinuities. We observe remarkably similar in- 
stability and near path-discontinuities in the kinematics of 16 subjects that learned 
force fields. This is behavioral evidence that learning control of novel dynamics is 
accomplished with an adaptive forward model of the system. 
2 Adaptive Control using Internal Models 
Adaptive control of a nonlinear system which has large sensory feedback delays, 
such as the human arm, can be accomplished by using two different internal model 
architectures. The first method uses only an adaptive inverse dynamics model to 
control the system (Shadmehr and Mussa-Ivaldi, 1994). The adaptive controller 
is feedforward in nature and ignores delayed feedback during the movement. The 
control system is stable because it relies on the equilibrium properties of the muscle 
and the spinal reflexes to correct for any deviations from the desired trajectory. 
The second method uses a rapidly adapting forward dynamics model and delayed 
sensory feedback in addition to an inverse dynamics model to control arm move- 
ments (Miall and Wolpert, 1996). In this case, the corrections to deviations from 
the desired trajectory are a result of a combination of supraspinal feedback as well 
as spinal/muscular feedback. Since the two methods rely on different internal model 
and feedback structures, they are expected to behave differently when the dynamics 
of the system are altered. 
The Mechanical Model of the Human Arm 
For the purpose of simulating arm movements with the two different control archi- 
tectures, a reasonably accurate model of the human arm is required. We model the 
arm as a two joint revolute arm attached to six muscles that act in pairs around 
the two joints. The three muscle pairs correspond to elbow joint, shoulder joint 
and two joint muscles and are assumed to have constant moment arms. Each mus- 
cle is modeled using a Hill parametric model with nonlinear stiffness and viscosity 
(Soechting and Flanders, 1997). The dynamics of the muscle can be represented by 
a nonlinear state function fM, such that, 
(1) 
where, Ft is the force developed by the muscle, N is the neural activation to the 
muscle, and x,, , are the muscle length and velocity. The passive dynamics 
related to the mechanics of the two-joint revolute arm can be represented by 
such that, 
 = fz>(T,x,.)= D-(x)[T-C(x,.). + J'F] (2)

where, / is the hand acceleration, T is the joint torque generated by the muscles, 
x,  are the hand position and velocity, D and C are the inertia and the coriolis 
matrices of the arm, J is the Jacobian for hand position and joint angle, and Fx is 
the external dynamic interaction force on the hand. 
Under the force field environment, the external force Fx acting on the hand is 
equal to B2, where B is a 2x2 rotational viscosity matrix. The effect of the force 
field is to push the hand perpendicular to the direction of movement with a force 
proportional to the speed of the hand. The overall forward plant dynamics of the 
arm is a combination of fM and fD and can be represented by the function fp, 
(a) 
Adaptive Inverse Model Feedforward Control 
The first control architecture uses a feedforward controller with only an adaptive 
inverse model. The inverse model computes the neural activation to the muscles 
for achieving a desired acceleration, velocity and position of the hand. It can be 
represented as the estimated inverse, f-l, of the forward plant dynamics, and maps 
the desired position xd, velocity 2d, and acceleration/a of the hand, into descending 
neural commands Nc. 
Nc = f-l(/a,xa,a) (4) 
Adaptation to novel external dynamics occurs by learning a new inverse model of the 
altered external environment. The error between desired and actual hand trajectory 
can be used for training the inverse model. When the inverse model is an exact 
inverse of the forward plant dynamics, the gain of the feedforward path is unity and 
the arm exactly tracks the desired trajectory. Deviations from the desired trajectory 
occur when the inverse model does not exactly model the external dynamics. Under 
that situation, the spinal reflex corrects for errors in desired (x,d, 2,a) and actual 
(x,, 2,) muscle state, by producing a corrective neural signal NR based on a linear 
feedback controller with constants K and K2.

Adaptive Forward-Inverse Model Feedback Control 
The second architecture provides feedback control of arm movements in addition 
to the feedforward control described above. Delays in feedback cause instability, 
therefore, the system relies on a forward model to generate updated state estimates 
of the arm. An estimated error in hand trajectory is given by the difference in 
desired and estimated state, and can be used by the brain to issue corrective neural 
signals to the muscles while a movement is being made. The forward model, written
