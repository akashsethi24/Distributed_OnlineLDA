Abstract 
The basic paradigm for learning in neural networks is 'learning from 
examples' where a training set of input-output examples is used to 
teach the network the target function. Learning from hints is a gen- 
eralization of learning from examples where additional information 
about the target function can be incorporated in the same learning 
process. Such information can come from common sense rules or 
special expertise. In financial market applications where the train- 
ing data is very noisy, the use of such hints can have a decisive 
advantage. We demonstrate the use of hints in foreign-exchange 
trading of the U.S. Dollar versus the British Pound, the German 
Mark, the Japanese Yen, and the Swiss Franc, over a period of 32 
months. We explain the general method of learning from hints and 
how it can be applied to other markets. The learning model for 
this method is not restricted to neural networks. 
I INTRODUCTION 
When a neural network learns its target function from examples (training data), 
it knows nothing about the function except what it sees in the data. In financial 
market applications, it is typical to have limited amount of relevant training data, 
with high noise levels in the data. The information content of such data is modest, 
and while the learning process can try to make the most of what it has, it cannot 
create new information on its own. This poses a fundamental limitation on the 
412 Yaser S. Abu-Mostafa 
learning approach, not only for neural networks, but for all other models as well. It 
is not uncommon to see simple rules such as the moving average outperforming an 
elaborate learning-from-examples system. 
Learning from hints (Abu-Mostafa, 1990, 1993) is a value-added feature to learning 
from examples that boosts the information content in the data. The method allows 
us to use prior knowledge about the target function, that comes from common sense 
or expertise, along with the training data in the same learning process. Different 
types of hints that may be available in a given application can be used simulta- 
neously. In this paper, we give experimental evidence of the impact of hints on 
learning performance, and explain the method in some detail to enable the readers 
to try their own hints in different markets. 
Even simple hints can result in significant improvement in the learning performance. 
Figure 1 shows the learning performance for foreign exchange (FX) trading with 
and without the symmetry hint (see section 3), using only the closing price history. 
The plots are the Annualized Percentage Returns (cumulative daily, unleveraged, 
transaction cost included), for a sliding one-year test window in the period from 
April 1988 to November 1990, averaged over the four major FX markets with more 
than 150 runs per currency. The error bar in the upper left corner is 3 standard de- 
viations long (based on 253 trading days, assuming independence between different 
runs). The plots establish a statistically significant differential in performance due 
to the use of hints. This differential holds for all four currencies.

Since the goal of hints is to add information to the training data, the differential 
in performance is likely to be less dramatic if we start out with more informative 
training data. Similarly, an additional hint may not have a pronounced effect if

we have already used a few hints in the same application. There is a saturation in 
performance in any market that reflects how well the future can be forecast from the 
past. (Believers in the Efficient Market Hypothesis consider this saturation to be at 
zero performance). Hints will not make us forecast a market better than whatever 
that saturation level may be. They will, however, enable us to approach that level 
through learning. 
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 characterizes the notion of very noisy 
data by defining the '50% performance range'. We argue that the need for extra 
information in financial market applications is more pronounced than in other pat- 
tern recognition applications. In section 3, we discuss our method for learning from 
hints. We give examples of different types of hints, and explain how to represent 
hints to the learning process. Section 4 gives result details on the use of the sym- 
metry hint in the four major FX markets. Section 5 provides experimental evidence 
that it is indeed the information content of the hint, rather than the incidental 
regularization effect, that results in the performance differential that we observe. 
2 FINANCIAL DATA 
This section provides a characterization of very noisy data that applies to the finan- 
cial markets. For a broad treatment of neural-network applications to the financial 
markets, the reader is referred to (Abu-Mostafa et al, 1994).

Figure 2: Illustration of the nature of noise in financial markets 
Consider the market as a system that takes in a lot of information (fundamentals, 
news events, rumors, who bought what when, etc.) and produces an output  (say 
up/down price movement for simplicity). A model, e.g., a neural network, attempts 
414 Yaser S. Abu-Mostafa 
to simulate the market (figure 2), but it takes an input x which is only a small 
subset of the information. The 'other information' cannot be modeled and plays 
the role of noise as far as x is concerned. The network cannot determine the target 
output  based on z alone, so it approximates it with its output//. It is typical that 
this approximation will be correct only slightly more than half the time.

What makes us consider z 'very noisy' is that t and  agree only  + e of the time 
(50% performance range). This is in contrast to the typical pattern recognition 
application, such as optical character recognition, where//and  agree 1 - e of the 
time (100% performance range). It is not the poor performance per se that poses 
a problem in the 50% range, but rather the additional difficulty of learning in this 
range. Here is why. 
In the 50% range, a performance of  + e is good, while a performance of - - 
e is disastrous. During learning, we need to distinguish between good and gad 
hypotheses based on a limited set of N examples. The problem with the 50% range 
is that the number of bad hypotheses that look good on N points is huge. This is 
in contrast to the 100% range where a good performance is as high as 1 - e. The 
number of bad hypotheses that look good here is limited. Therefore, one can have 
much more confidence in a hypothesis that was learned in the 100% range than 
one learned in the 50% range. It is not uncommon to see a random trading policy 
making good money for a few weeks, but it is very unlikely that a random character 
recognition system will read a paragraph correctly. 
Of course this problem would diminish if we used a very large set of examples, 
because the law of large numbers would make it less and less likely that t and  can 
agree  + e of the time just by 'coincidence'. However, financial data has the other 
problem of non-stationarity. Because of the continuous evolution in the markets, 
old data may represent patterns of behavior that no longer hold. Thus, the relevant 
data for training purposes is limited to fairly recent times. Put together, noise and 
non-stationarity mean that the training data will not contain enough information 
for the network to learn the function. More information is needed, and hints can 
be the means of providing it. 
3 HINTS 
In this section, we give examples of different types of hints and discuss how to 
represent them to the learning process. We describe a simple way to use hints 
that allows the reader to try the method with minimal effort. For a more detailed 
treatment, please see (Abu-Mostafa, 1993). 
As far as our method is concerned, a hint is any property that the target function 
is known to have. For instance, consider the symmetry hint in FX markets as it 
applies to the U.S. Dollar versus the German Mark (figure 3). This simple hint 
asserts that if a pattern in the price history implies a certain move in the market, 
then this implication holds whether you are looking at the market from the U.S. 
Dollar viewpoint or the German Mark viewpoint. Formally, in terms of normalized 
prices, the hint translates to invariance under inversion of these prices. 
Is the symmetry hint valid? The ultimate test for this is how the learning perfor- 
mance is affected by the introduction of the hint. The formulation of hints is an art. 
Financial Applications of Learning from Hints 415 
We use our experience, common sense, and analysis of the market to come up with 
a list of what we believe to be valid properties of this market. We then represent 
these hints in a canonical form as we will see shortly, and proceed to incorporate 
them in the learning process. The improvement in performance will only be as good 
as the hints we put in.

The canonical representation of hints is a more systematic task. The first step in 
representing a hint is to choose a way of generating 'virtual examples' of the hint. 
For illustration, suppose that the hint asserts that the target function . is an odd 
function of the input. An example of this hint would have the form .0(-x) = 
for a particular input x. One can generate as many virtual examples as needed by 
picking different inputs. 
After a hint is represented by virtual e
