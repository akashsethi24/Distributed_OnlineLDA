Abstract 
In consideration of attention as a means for goal-directed behav- 
ior in non-stationary environments, we argue that the dynamics of 
attention should satisfy two opposing demands: long-term main- 
tenance and quick transition. These two characteristics are con- 
tradictory within the linear domain. We propose the near saddle- 
node bifurcation behavior of a sigmoidal unit with self-connection 
as a candidate of dynamical mechanism that satisfies both of these 
demands. We further show in simulations of the 'bug-eat-food' 
tasks that the near saddle-node bifurcation behavior of recurrent 
networks can emerge as a functional property for survival in non- 
stationary environments. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
Most studies of attention have focused on the selection process of incoming sensory 
cues (Posner et al., 1980; Koch et al., 1985; Desimone et al., 1995). Emphasis was 
placed on the phenomena of causing different percepts for the same sensory stimuli. 
However, the selection of sensory input itself is not the final goal of attention. We 
consider attention as a means for goal-directed behavior and survival of the animal. 
In this view, dynamical properties of attention are crucial. While attention has 
to be maintained long enough to enable robust response to sensory input, it also 
has to be shifted quickly to a novel cue that is potentially important. Long-term 
maintenance and quick transition are critical requirements for attention dynamics.

Dynamics of Attention as Near Saddle-node Bifurcation Behavior 39 
We investigate a possible neural mechanism that enables those dynamical charac- 
teristics of attention. 
First, we analyze the dynamics of a network of sigmoidal units with self-connections. 
We show that both long-term maintenance and quick transition can be achieved 
when the system parameters are near a saddle-node bifurcation point. Then, we 
test if such a dynamical mechanism can actually be helpful for an autonomously 
behaving agent in simulations of a 'bug-eat-food' task. The result indicates that 
near saddle-node bifurcation behavior can emerge in the course of evolution for 
survival in non-stationary environments. 
2 NEAR SADDLE-NODE BIFURCATION BEHAVIOR 
When a pulse-like input is given to a linear system, the rising and falling phases 
of the response have the same time constants. This means that long-term mainte- 
nance and quick transition cannot be simultaneously achieved by linear dynamics. 
Therefore, it is essential to consider a nonlinear dynamical mechanism to achieve 
these two demands. 
2.1 DYNAMICS OF A SELF-RECURRENT UNIT 
First, we consider the dynamics of a single sigmoidal unit with the self-connection 
weight a and the bias b. 
y(t + l) = F(ay(t)+b), (1) 
1 
F(x) = 1 +exp(-x)' (2) 
The parameters (a, b) determine the qualitative behavior of the system such as the 
number of fixed points and their stabilities. As we change the parameters, the 
qualitative behavior of the system may suddenly change. This is referred to as 
bifurcation (Guckenheimer, et al., 1983). A typical example is a saddle-node 
bifurcation in which a pair of fixed points, one stable and one unstable, emerges. 
In our system, this occurs when the state transition curve y(t + 1)- F(ay(t)+b)is 
tangent to y(t + 1) = y(t). Let y* be this point of tangency. We have the following 
condition for saddle-node bifurcation. 
F(ay* + b) = y* (3) 
dF(ay+b) l = 1 (4) 
dy y_y. 
These equations can be solved, by noting F'(x) = F(x)(1 - F(x)), as 
1 
a = (5) 
y*(1- y*) 
1 
b = F-(y *) -ay* = F-(y *) 1 - y* (6) 
By changing the fixed point value y* between 0 and 1, we can plot a curve in the 
parameter space (a, b) on which saddle-node bifurcation occurs, as shown in Figure 
1 (left). A pair of a saddle point and a stable fixed point emerges or disappears 
when the parameters pass across the cusp like curve (cases 2 and 4). The system 
has only one stable fixed point when the parameters are outside the cusp (case 1) 
and three fixed points inside the cusp (case 3).

An interesting behavior can be seen when the parameters are just outside the cusp, 
as shown in Figure 2 (left). The system has only one fixed point near y -- 0, but 
once the unit is activated (y _ 1), it stays on for many time steps and then goes 
back to the fixed point quickly. Such a mechanism may be useful in satisfying the 
requirements of attention dynamics: long-term maintenance and quick transition. 
2.2 NETWORK OF SELF-RECURRENT UNITS 
Next, we consider the dynamics of a network of the above self-recurrent units. 
yi(t + 1)- F[ayi(t) + b+ y cijyj(t) + diui(t)], (7) 
j ,j i 
where a is the self connection weight, b is the bias, cij is the cross connection weight, 
and di is the input connection weight, and ui(t) is the external input. The effect of 
lateral and external inputs is equivalent to the change in the bias, which slides the 
sigmoid curve horizontally without changing the slope. 
For example, one parameter set of the bifurcation at y* - 0.9 is a = 11.11 and 
b _ -7.80. Let b: -7.90 so that the unit has a near saddle-node bifurcation 
behavior when there is no lateral or external inputs. For a fixed a = 11.11, as we 
increase b, the qualitative behavior of the system appears as case 3 in Figure 1, and

then, it changes again at b _ -3.31, where the fixed point at y 
bifurcation point, appears as case 4 in Figure 1. Therefore, if the 
enough, i.e. -j,ji cijyj + diuj > -3.31 - (-7.90) _ 4.59, the 
at y - 0.1 disappears and the state jumps up to the upper fixed 
- 0.1, or another

point near y - 1 
quickly turning the unit on. If the lateral connections are set properly, this can 
in turn suppress the activation of other units. Once the external input goes away, 
as we see in Figure 2 (left), the state stays on for a long time until it returns to 
the fixed point near y - 0. 
3 EVOLUTION OF NEAR BIFURCATION DYNAMICS 
In the above section, we have theoretically shown the potential usefulness of near 
saddle-node bifurcation behavior for satisfying demands for attention dynamics. We 
further hypothesize that such behavior is indeed useful in animal behaviors and can 
be found in the course of learning and evolution of the neural system. 
To test our hypothesis, we simulated a 'bug-eat-food' task. Our purpose in this 
simulation was to see whether the attention dynamics discussed in the previous 
section would help obtain better performance in a non-stationary environment. We 
used evolutionary programming (Fogel et al, 1990) to optimize the performance of 
recurrent networks and feedforward networks. 
3.1 THE BUG AND THE WORLD 
In our simulation, a simple creature traveled around a non-stationary environment. 
In the world, there were a certain number of food items. Each item was fixed at a 
certain place in the world but appeared or disappeared in a stochastic fashion, as 
determined by a two-state Markov system. In order to survive, A creature looked 
for food by traveling the world. The amount of food a creature found in a certain 
time period was the measure of its performance. 
A creature had five sensory inputs, each of which detected food in the sector of 45 
 where rj was the 
degrees (Figure 3, right). Its output level was given by j r-;, 
distance to the j-th food item within the sector. Note that the format of the input 
contained information about distance and also that the creature could only receive 
the amount of the input but could not distinguish each food from others. 
For the sake of simplicity, we assumed that the creature lived in a grid-like world. 
On each time step, it took one of three motor commands: L' turn left (45 degrees),

different Markov transition matrices of food appearance and with different food 
densities. A creature got the food when it reached the food, whether it was visible 
or invisible. When a creature ate a food item, a new food item was placed randomly. 
The size of the world was 10x10 and both ends were connected as a torus. 
A creature was composed of two layers: visual layer and motor layer (Figure 3,

dynamics were given by Equation (7). The self-connection a, t
