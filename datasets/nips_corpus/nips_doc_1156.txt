Abstract 
Recently Sillito and coworkers (Nature 378, pp. 492, 1995) demon- 
strated that stimulation beyond the classical receptive field (cRF) 
can not only modulate, but radically change a neuron's response to 
oriented stimuli. They revealed that patch-suppressed cells when 
stimulated with contrasting orientations inside and outside their 
cRF can strongly respond to stimuli oriented orthogonal to their 
nominal preferred orientation. Here we analyze the emergence of 
such complex response patterns in a simple model of primary vi- 
sual cortex. We show that the observed sensitivity for orientation 
contrast can be explained by a delicate interplay between local 
isotropic interactions and patchy long-range connectivity between 
distant iso-orientation domains. In particular we demonstrate that 
the observed properties might arise without specific connections be- 
tween sites with cross-oriented cRFs. 
I Introduction 
Long range horizontal connections form a ubiquitous structural element of intra- 
cortical circuitry. In the primary visual cortex long range horizontal connections 
extend over distances spanning several hypercolumns and preferentially connect 
cells of similar orientation preference [1, 2, 3, 4]. Recent evidence suggests that

their physiological effect depends on the level of postsynaptic depolarization; act- 
ing exitatory on weakly activated and inhibitory on strongly activated cells [5, 6]. 
This differental influence possibly underlies perceptual phenomena as 'pop out' and 
'fill in' [9]. Previous modeling studies demonstrated that such differential interac- 
tions may arise from a single set of long range excitatory connections terminating 
both on excitatory and inhibitory neurons in a given target column [7, 8]. By and 
large these results suggest that long range horizontal connections between columns 
of like stimulus preference provide a central mechanism for the context dependent 
regulation of activation in cortical networks. 
Recent experiments by Sillito et al. suggest, however, that lateral connections 
in primary visual cortex can also induce more radical changes in receptive field 
organization [10]. Most importantly this study shows that patch-suppressed cells 
can respond selectively to orientation contrast between center and surround of a sti- 
mulus even if they are centrally stimulated orthogonal to their preferred orientation. 
$illito et al. argued, that these response properties require specific connections 
between orthogonally tuned columns for which, however, presently there is only 
weak evidence. 
Here we demonstrate that such nonclassical receptive field properties might instead 
arise as an emergent property of the known intracortical circuitry. We investigate a 
simple model for intracortical activity dynamics driven by weakly orientation tuned 
afferent excitation. The cortical actitvity dynamics is based on a continous firing 
rate description and incorporates both a local center-surrond type interaction and 
long range connections between distant columns of like orientation preference. The 
connections of distant orientation columns are assumed to act either excitatory or 
inhibitory depending on the activation of their target neurons. It turns out that this 
set of interactions not only leads to the emergence of patch-suppressed cells, but 
also that a large fraction of these cells exhibits a selectivity for orientation contrast 
very similar to the one observed by Sillito et al.. 
2 Model 
Our target is the analysis of basic rate modulations emerging from local and long 
range feedback interactions in a simple model of visual cortex. It is therefore ap- 
propriate to consider a simple rate dynamics :k = -c. x + F(x), where x = {xi, i = 
1...N} are the activation levels of N neurons. F(x) = g(Imex(X) + Ilar(X) + Iext), 
where g(I) = co. (I- Ithres) if I > Ithres, and g(I) - 0 otherwise, denotes the firing 
rate or gain function in dependence of the input I. 
The neurons are arranged in a quadratic array representing a small part of the visual 
cortex. Within this layer, neuron i has a position ri and a preferred orientation 
i E [0,180]. The input to neuron i has three contributions I: I ex + 1 at + I xt.

range lateral interaction in dependence of the postsynaptic activation, summarizing 
the behavior of a local circuit in which the inhibitory population has a larger gain. 
In particular, wt(x) can be derived analytically from a simple cortical microcircuit 
(Fig.2). This circuit consists of an inhibitory and excitatory cell population con- 
nected reciprocally. Each population receives lateral input and is driven by the 
external stimulus I. The effective interaction wL depends on the lateral input L 
and external input I. Assuming a piecewise linear gain function for each popu- 
lation, similar as those for the xi's, the phase-space I-L is partitioned in some 
regions. Only if both I and L are small, wL is positive; justifying the choice
