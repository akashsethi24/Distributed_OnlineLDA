Abstract 
It is known from biological data that the response patterns of 
interneurons in the olfactory macroglomerulus (MGC) of insects are of 
central importance for the coding of the olfactory signal. We propose an 
analytically tractable model of the MGC which allows us to relate the 
distribution of response patterns to the architecture of the network. 
1. Introduction 
The processing of pheromone odors in the antennal lobe of several insect species relies on 
a number of response patterns of the antennal lobe neurons in reaction to stimulation with 
pheromone components and blends. Antennal lobe interneurons receive input from different 
receptor types, and relay this input to antennal lobe projection neurons via excitatory as 
well as inhibitory synapses. The diversity of the responses of the interneurons and 
projection neurons as well the long response latencies of these neurons to pheromone 
stimulation or electrical stimulation of the antenna, suggest a polysynaptic pathway

In the MGC of Manduca sexta, antennal lobe interneurons respond in various ways to 
antennal stimulation with single pheromone components or the blend: pheromone 
generalists respond by either excitation or inhibition to both components and the blend: 
they cannot discriminate the components; pheromone specialists respond (i) to one 
component but not to the other by either excitation or inhibition, (ii) with different 
response patterns to the presence of the single components or the blend, namely with 
excitation to one component, with inhibition to the other component and with a mixed 
response to the blend. These neurons can also follow pulsed stimulation up to a cut-off 
frequency (Figure 1). 
A model of the MGC (Linster et al, 1993), based on biological data (anatomical and 
physiological) has demonstrated that the full diversity of response patterns can be 
reproduced with a random architecture using very simple ingredients such as spiking 
neurons governed by a first order differential equation, and synapses modeled as simple 
delay lines. In a model with uniform distributions of afferent, inhibitory and excitatory 
synapses, the distribution of the response patterns depends on the following network 
parameters: the percentage of afferent, inhibitory and excitatory synapses, the ratio of the 
average excitation of any interneuron to its spiking threshold, and the amount of feedback 
in the network. 
In the present paper, we show that the behavior of such a model can be described by a 
statistical approach, allowing us to search through parameter space and to make predictions 
about the biological system without exhaustive simulations. We compare the results 
obtained with simulation of the network model to the results obtained analytically by the 
statistical approach, and we show that the approximations made for the statistical 
descriptions are valid. 
2. Simulations and comparison to biological data 
In (Linster et al, 1993), we have used a simple neuron model: all neurons are spiking 
neurons, governed by a first order differential equation, with a membrane time constant and 
a probabilistic threshold O. The time constant represents the decay time of the membrane 
potential of the neuron. The output of each neuron consists of an all-or-none action 
potential with unit amplitude that is generated when the membrane potential of the cell 
crosses a threshold, whose cumulative distribution function is a continuous and bounded 
probabilistic function of the membrane potential. All sources of delay and signal 
transformation from the presynaptic neuron to its postsynaptic site are modeled by a 
synaptic time delay. These delays are chosen in a random distribution (gaussian), with a 
longer mean value for inhibitory synapses than for excitatory synapses. We model two 
main populations of olfactory neurons: receptor neurons which are sensitive to the main 
pheromone component (called A) or to the minor pheromone component (called B) project 
uniformly onto the network of interneurons; two types of interneurons (excitatory and 
inhibitory) exist: each interneuron is allowed to make one synapse with any other 
interneuron. 
The model exhibits several behaviors that agree with biological data, and it allows us to 
state several predictive hypotheses about the processing of the pheromone blend. We 
observe two broad classes of interneurons: selective (to one odor component) and non- 
selective neurons (in comparison to Figure 1). Selective neurons and non-selective neurons 
exhibit a variety of response patterns, which fall into three classes: inhibitory, excitatory 
and mixed (Figure 2). Such a classification has indeed been proposed for olfactory antennal

lobe neurons (local interneurons and projection neurons) in the specialist olfactory system 
in Manduca (Christensen and Hildebrand, 1987) and for the cockroach (Burrows et al, 1982; 
Boeckh and Ernst, 1987).

Figure 2: Response patterns of interneurons in the model presented, in response to 
stimulation with single components A and B, and with a blend with equal 
component concentrations. Receptor neurons fire at maximum frequency during the 
stimulations. The interneuron in the upper row is inhibited by stimulus A, excited 
by stimulus B, and has a mixed response (excitation followed by inhibition) to the 
blend: in reference to Figure 1, this is a pheromone specialist receiving mixed input 
from both types of receptor neurons. These types of simple and mixed responses can 
be observed in the model at low connectivity, where the average excitation received 
by an interneuron is low compared to its spiking threshold. The neuron in the middle 
row responds with similar mixed responses to stimuli A, B and A+B. The neuron in 
the lower row responds to all stimuli with the same oscillatory response, here the 
average excitation received by an interneuron approaches or exceeds the spiking 
threshold of the neurons. Network parameters: 15 receptor neurons; 35 interneurons; 
40% excitatory interneurons; 60% inhibitory interneurons; afferent connectivity 
10%; membrane time constant 25 ms; mean inhibitory synaptic delays 100 ms; 
mean excitatory synaptic delays 25 ms, spiking threshold 4.0, synaptic weights +1 
and -1.

In our model, as well as in biological systems (Christensen and Hildebrand 1988, 
Christensen et al., 1989) we observe a number of local interneurons that cannot follow 
pulsed stimulation beyond a neuron-specific cut-off frequency. This frequency depends on 
the neuron response pattern and on the duration of the interstimulus interval. 
Therefore, the type of response pattern is of central importance for the coding of the 
olfactory signal. Thus, in order to be able to relate the coding capabilities of a (model or 
biological) network to its architecture, we have investigated the distribution of response 
patterns both analytically and by simulations. 
3. Analytical approach 
In order to investigate these questions in a more rigorous way, some of us (C.L., D.M., 
G.D., L.P.) have designed a simplified, analytically tractable model. 
We define two layers of intemeurons: those which receive direct afferent input from the 
receptor neurons (layer 1), and those which receive only input from other interneurons 
(layer 2). In order to predict the response pattern of any interneuron as a function of the 
network parameters, we make the following assumptions: (i) statistically, all interneurons 
within a given layer receive the same synaptic input, (ii) the effect of feedback loops from 
layer 2 can be neglected, (iii) the response patterns have the same distribution for 
stimulations either by the blend or by pure components. Assumption (i) is correct because 
of the uniform distribution of synapses in the network of interneurons. Assumption (ii) is 
valid at low connectivity: if the average amou
