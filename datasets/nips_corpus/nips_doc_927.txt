Abstract 
A neural network model for the self-organization of ocular dominance and 
lateral connections from binocular input is presented. The self-organizing 
process results in a network where (1) afferent weights of each neuron or- 
ganize into smooth hill-shaped receptive fields primarily on one of the reti- 
nas, (2) neurons with common eye preference form connected, intertwined 
patches, and (3) lateral connections primarily link regions of the same eye 
preference. Similar self-organization of cortical structures has been ob- 
served experimentally in strabismic kittens. The model shows how pat- 
terned lateral connections in the cortex may develop based on correlated 
activity and explains why lateral connection patterns follow receptive field 
properties such as ocular dominance. 
1 Introduction 
Lateral connections in the primary visual cortex have a patterned structure that closely 
matches the response properties of cortical cells (Gilbert and Wiese11989; Malach et al. 1993). 
For example, in the normal visual cortex, long-range lateral connections link areas with sim- 
ilar orientation preference (Gilbert and Wiesel 1989). Like cortical response properties, the 
connectivity pattern is highly plastic in early development and can be altered by experience 
(Katz and Callaway 1992). In a cat that is brought up squint-eyed from birth, the lateral con- 
nections link areas with the same ocular dominance instead of orientation (L6wel and Singer 
1992). Such patterned lateral connections develop at the same time as the orientation selectiv- 
ity and ocular dominance itself (Burkhalter et al. 1993; Katz and Callaway 1992). Together,

these observations suggest that the same experience-dependent process drives the develop- 
ment of both cortical response properties and lateral connectivity. 
Several computational models have been built to demonstrate how orientation preference, 
ocular dominance, and retinotopy can emerge from simple self-organizing processes (e.g. 
Goodhill 1993; Miller 1994; Obermayer et al. 1992; von der Malsburg 1973). These models 
assume that the neuronal response properties are primarily determined by the afferent con- 
nections, and concentrate only on the self-organization of the afferent synapses to the cor- 
tex. Lateral interactions between neurons are abstracted into simple mathematical functions 
(e.g. Gaussians) and assumed to be uniform throughout the network; lateral connectivity is not 
explicitly taken into account. Such models do not explicitly replicate the activity dynamics 
of the visual cortex, and therefore can make only limited predictions about cortical function. 
We have previously shown how Kohonen's self-organizing feature maps (Kohonen 1982) 
can be generalized to include self-organizing lateral connections and recurrent activity dy- 
namics (the Laterally Interconnected S ynergetically Self-Organizing Map (LIS SOM); Sirosh 
and Miikkulainen 1993, 1994a), and how the algorithm can model the development of ocu- 
lar dominance columns and patterned lateral connectivity with abstractions of visual input. 
LIS SOM is a low-dimensional abstraction of cortical self-organizing processes and models a 
small region of the cortex where all neurons receive the same input vector. This paper shows 
how realistic, high-dimensional receptive fields develop as part of the self-organization, and 
scales up the LISSOM approach to large areas of the cortex where different parts of the corti- 
cal network receive inputs from different parts of the receptor surface. The new model shows 
how (1) afferent receptive fields and ocular dominance columns develop from simple reti- 
nal images, (2) input correlations affect the wavelength of the ocular dominance columns and 
(3) lateral connections self-organize cooperatively and simultaneously with ocular dominance 
properties. The model suggests new computational roles for lateral connections in the cortex, 
and suggests that the visual cortex maybe maintained in a continuously adapting equilibrium 
with the visual input by coadapting lateral and afferent connections. 
2 The LISSOM Model of Receptive Fields and Ocular Dominance 
The LISSOM network is a sheet of interconnected neurons (figure 1). Through afferent con- 
nections, each neuron receives input from two retinas. In addition, each neuron has recip- 
rocal excitatory and inhibitory lateral connections with other neurons. Lateral excitatory con- 
nections are short-range, connecting only close neighbors. Lateral inhibitory connections mn 
for long distances, and may even implement full connectivity between neurons in the network. 
Neurons receive afferent connections from broad overlapping patches on the retina called 
anatomical receptive fields, or RFs. The N x N network is projected on to each retina of 
/ x/ receptors, and each neuron is connected to receptors in a square area of side s around 
the projections. Thus, neurons receive afferents from corresponding regions of each retina. 
Depending on the location of the projection, the number of afferents to a neuron from each

The external and lateral weights are organized through an unsupervised learning process. At 
each training step, neurons start out with zero activity. The initial response r]ij of neuron (i, j)

where b and c are the activations of retinal receptors (a, b) and (c, d) within the receptive 
fields of the neuron in each retina, izij,.b and izij,ca are the corresponding afferent weights, 
and r is a piecewise linear approximation of the familiar sigmoid activation function. The 
response evolves over time through lateral interaction. At each time step, the neuron com- 
bines the above afferent activation '. ï¿½/z with lateral excitation and inhibition:

where Eij,kl is the excitatory lateral connection weight on the connection from neuron (k, l) 
to neuron (i, j), Iij,kt is the inhibitory connection weight, and r/l (t - 1) is the activity of 
neuron (k, l) during the previous time step. The constants % and 7i determine the relative 
strengths of excitatory and inhibitory lateral interactions. The activity pattern starts out dif- 
fuse and spread over a substantial part of the map, and converges iteratively into stable focused 
patches of activity, or activity bubbles. After the-activity has settled, typically in a few iter- 
ations of equation 2, the connection weights of each neuron are modified. Both afferent and 
lateral weights adapt according to the same mechanism: the Hebb role, normalized so that the 
sum of the weights is constant:

where ij stands for the activity of neuron (i, j) in the final activity bubble, wij,mn is the affer- 
ent or lateral connection weight (/z, E or I), a is the learning rate for each type of connection 
(as for afferent weights, az for excitatory, and ar for inhibitory) and X,, is the presynaptic 
activity ( for afferent, V for lateral).

of a neuron at position (42, 39) in a 60 x 60 network are shown before (a) and after self-organization 
(b). This particular neuron becomes monocular with strong connections to the right eye, and weak con- 
nections to the left. A neuron at position (38, 23) becomes binocular with appoximately equal weights 
to both eyes (c). 
Both excitatory and inhibitory lateral connections follow the same Hebbian learning pro- 
cess and strengthen by correlated activity. The short-range excitation keeps the activity of 
neighboring neurons correlated, and as self-organization progresses, excitation and inhibi- 
tion strengthen in the vicinity of each neuron. At longer distances, very few neurons have 
correlated activity and therefore most long-range connections become weak. Such weak con- 
nections are eliminated, and through weight normalization, inhibition concentrates in a closer 
neighborhood of each neuron. As a result, activity bubbles become more focused and local, 
weights change in smaller neighborhoods, and receptive fields become better tuned to local 
areas of each retina.

spot, and (xi,Yi): 0 _ xi, Yi < R its center. At each input presentation, one spot is randomly 
placed at (xi,Yi) in the left retina, and a second spot within a radius of p x RN of (xi, Yi) 
in the right retina. The parameter p E [0, 1] specifies the spatial correlations between spots 
in the two retinas, and can be adjusted to simulate different degrees of correlations between 
images in the two eyes.

To see how correlation between the input from the two eyes affects the columnar structures 
that develop, several simulations were run with different values of p. The afferent weights of 
all neurons were initially random (as shown in figure 2a), with the total strength to b
