Abstract 
Which processes underly our ability to quickly recognize familiar 
objects within a complex visual input scene? In this paper an imple- 
mented neural network model is described that attempts to specify 
how selective visual attention, perceptual organisation, and invari- 
ance transformations might work together in order to segment, select, 
and recognize objects out of complex input scenes containing multi- 
ple, possibly overlapping objects. Retinotopically organized feature 
maps serve as input for two main processing routes: the 'where- 
pathway' dealing with location information and the 'what-pathway' 
computing the shape and attributes of objects. A location-based at- 
tention mechanism operates on an early stage of visual processing 
selecting a contigous region of the visual field for preferential proces- 
sing. Additionally, location-based attention plays an important role 
for invariant object recognition controling appropriate normalization 
processes within the what-pathway. Object recognition is supported 
through the segmentation of the visual field into distinct entities. In 
order to represent different segmented entities at the same time, the 
model uses an oscillatory binding mechanism. Connections between 
the where-pathway and the what-pathway lead to a flexible coope- 
ration between different functional subsystems producing an overall 
behavior which is consistent with a variety of psychophysical data.

I INTRODUCTION 
We are able to recognize a familiar object from many different viewpoints. Addi- 
tionally, an object normally does not appear in isolation but in combination with 
other objects. These varying viewing conditions produce very different retinal neural 
representations. The task of the visual system can be considered as a transformation 
process forming high-level object representations which are invariant with respect to 
different viewing conditions. Selective attention and perceptual organisation seem to 
play an important role in this transformation process. 
1.1 LOCATION-BASED VS OBJECT-BASED ATTENTION 
Neisser (1967) assumed that visual processing is done in two stages: an early stage 
that operates in parallel across the entire visual field, and a later stage that can 
only process information from a limited part of the field at any one time. Neisser 
(1967) proposed an object-based approach to selective attention: the first, 'preatten- 
tive', stage segments the whole field into seperate objects on the basis of Gestalt 
principles; the second stage, focal attention, selects one of these objects for detailed 
analysis. 
Other theories stress the location-based nature of visual attention: a limited contigous 
region is filtered for detailed analysis (e.g., Posner et al., 1980). There exists a num- 
ber of models of location-based attention (e.g., Hinton & Lang, 1985; Mozer, 1991; 
Sandon, 1990) and a few models of object-based attention using whole object kno- 
wledge (e.g., Fukushima, 1986). Our model attempts to integrate both approaches: 
location-based attention - implemented as a 'spotlight' - operates on an early stage 
of visual processing selecting a contigous region for detailed processing. However, the 
position and the size of the attentional window is determined to a large extent from 
the results of a segmentation process operating at different levels within the system. 
1.2 DYNAMIC BINDING 
The question of how groupings can be represented in a neural network is known as 
the binding problem. It occurs in many variations, e.g., as the problem of how to 
represent multiple objects simultaneously but sufiqciently distinct that confusions ('il- 
lusory conjunctions') at later processing stages are avoided. 
An interesting solution of the binding problem is based on ideas proposed by Mil- 
ner (1974) and von der Malsburg (1981). In contrast to most connectionist models 
assuming that only the average output activity of neurons encodes important informa- 
tion, they suggest that the exact timing of neuronal activity (the firing of individual 
neurons or the 'bursting' of cell groups) plays an important role for information pro- 
cessing in the brain. The central idea is that stimulated units do not respond with a 
constant output but with oscillatory bellariot which can be exploited to represent fea- 
ture linkings. A possible solution for representing multiple objects might be that the 
parts of one object are bound together through synchronized (phase-locked) oscillati- 
ons and separated from other objects through an uncorellated phase relation. Recent 
empirical findings (Eckhorn et al., 1988; Gray &; Singer, 1989) provide some evidence 
that the brain may indeed use phase-locked oscillations as a means for representing 
global object properties.

2 THE MODEL 
2.1 SYSTEM DYNAMICS 
In order to establish dynamic binding via phase-locked oscillations the units of the 
model must be able to exhibit oscillatory behavior. Stimulated from the empirical 
findings mentioned earlier, a rapidly growing number of work has studied populations 
of oscillating units (e.g., Eckhorn et al., 1990; Sompolinsky et al., 1990). There exists 
also a number of models using phase-locked oscillations in order to simulate various 
aspects of perceptual organisation (e.g., Schillen & KSnig, 1991; Mozer, Zemel, Behr- 
mann & Williams, 1992). We defined computationally simple model neurons which 
allow to represent independently an activation value and a period value. Such a mo- 
del neuron possesses two types of input areas: the activation gate (a-gate) and the 
period-gate (p-gate) which allow the model neurons to communicate via two types of 
connections (cf. Eckhorn et al., 1990; they distinguish between 'feeding' and 'linking' 
connections). We make the following definitions: 
� wj' weight from model neuron j to the a-gate of model neuron i. 
P � weight from model neuron j to the p-gate of model neuron i. 
� Wij. 
� i(t): internal time-keeper of unit i 
� T: globally defined period length 
� T/(N): period length of unit i (Nth oscillation) 
Each model neuron possesses an internal time-keeper i(t) counting the number of 
bins elapsed since the last firing point. A model neuron is refractory until the time- 
keeper reaches the value Ti (e.g., T/= T = 8). Then it may emit an activation value 
and resets the time-keeper. Depending on the stimulation received at the p-gate 
(see below) a model neuron fires either if ( = T- 1 or ( = T. This variation of 
the individual period length T/ is the only possibility for a unit to change its phase 
relation to other units. The value of the globally defined period length T determines 
directly how many objects may be represented 'simultaneously'. 
The activation value ai at the internal time ( is determined as follows: 
neti( : i) :   wiaj() 
(----1 j-1 
(1) 
(1 - T)ai(( - Ti) q- T o'(rlcti(() q- bi) 
ai() - 0 
if( = T/ 
otherwise (2) 
where g(x)is the logistic (sigmoidal) function. If we consider an extreme case with 
T = 1 we obtain the following equations: 
j=l

(4) 
This derivation allows us to study the same network as a conventional connectionist 
network (T = 1) with a 'non-oscillatory' activation function to which we can add a 
dynamic binding mechanism by simply setting T > 1. In the latter case the input 
at the p-gate determines the length of the current period as either T/ = T- 1 or 
T/ = T. The decision to shift the phase relation to other neurons should be done in 
such a way that the 'belonginghess constraints' imposed by the connectivity pattern 
P is maximized, e.g., if two units are positively p-coupled they 
of the p-weights wij 
should oscillate in phase, if they are negatively p-coupled they should oscillate out 
of phase. The decision whether a unit fires at T- 1 or T depends on two values, 
the stimulation received during the refractory period 1 _<  < T/(N - 1) and on the 
stimulation received at the last firing point  = T/(N - 1). These values behave as 
two opposite forces gi determining the probability Pi < of shortening the next period: 
if ( = T (5) 
ifl _(( <Ts (6) 
1 - 2r 
Pi < - r + 1 + e(a}-a ) (7) 
If the value of g -g is large (e.g., there are many positively p-coupled units firing at 
the same time) it is unlikely that the unit shortens its next period length. If instead 
the value of g-g is large (e.g., there are many positively coupled neurons firing just 
before the considered unit) it is likely that the unit will shorten its next period. There 
exists also a small overall noise level r = 0.01 which allows for symmetry breaking 
(e.g., if two strongly negatively coupled neurons are accidentally phase-locked). 
2.2 THE INPUT MODULE 
Figure 1 shows an overview of the architecture of the model, called HOTSPOT. An 
input is presented to the model by clamping on units at the model-retina consisting 
of two layers with 15x25 units. Each layer is meant to correspond to a different 
color-sensitive ganglion cell type. The retinal representation is then analyzed within 
different retinotopically organized feature maps (4 oriented line segments and 2 uno- 
riented color blobs) as a simplified representation of an early visual processing stage 
(corresponding roughly to V1). A lateral connectivity pattern of p-weights within 
and between these feature maps computes initial feature linkings consistent with the 
findings of Eckhorn et al., (1988) and Gray and Singer (1989). Each feature map also 
projects to a second feature-specific layer. The weights between t
