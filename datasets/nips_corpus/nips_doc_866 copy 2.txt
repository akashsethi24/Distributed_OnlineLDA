Abstract 
We present an analog VLSI chip for parallel analog vector quantiza- 
tion. The MOSIS 2.0 tzm double-poly CMOS Tiny chip contains an 
array of 16 x 16 charge-based distance estimation cells, implementing a 
mean absolute difference (MAD) metric operating on a 16-input analog 
vector field and 16 analog template vectors. The distance cell includ- 
ing dynamic template storage measures 60 x 78 /xm 2. Additionally, 
the chip features a winner-take-all (WTA) output circuit of linear com- 
plexity, with global positive feedback for fast and decisive settling of a 
single winner output. Experimental results on the complete 16 x 16 VQ 
system demonstrate correct operation with 34 dB analog input dynamic 
range and 3 tzsec cycle time at 0.7 mW power dissipation. 
1 Introduction 
Vector quantization (VQ) [ 1] is a common ingredient in signal processing, for applications 
of pattern recognition and data compression in vision, speech and beyond. Certain neural 
network models for pattern recognition, such as Kohonen feature map classifiers [2], are 
closely related to VQ as well. The implementation of VQ, in its basic form, involves a 
search among a set of vector templates for the one which best matches the input vector, 
whereby the degree of matching is quantified by a given vector distance metric. Effi-

cient hardware implementation requires a parallel search over the template set and a fast 
selection and encoding of the winning template. The chip presented here implements 
a parallel synchronous analog vector quantizer with 16 analog input vector components 
and 16 dynamically stored analog template vectors, producing a 4-bit digital output word 
encoding the winning template upon presentation of an input vector. The architecture is 
fully scalable as in previous implementations of analog vector quantizers, e.g. [3,4,5,6], 
and can be readily expanded toward a larger number of vector components and template 
vectors without structural modification of the layout. Distinct features of the present 
implementation include a linear winner-take-all (WTA) structure with globalized posi- 
tive feedback for fast selection of the winning template, and a mean absolute difference 
(MAD) metric for the distance estimations, both realized with a minimum amount of 
circuitry. Using a linear charge-based circuit topology for MAD distance accumulation, 
a wide voltage range for the analog inputs and templates is achieved at relatively low 
energy consumption per computation cycle. 
2 System Architecture 
The core of the VQ consists of a 16 x 16 2-D array of distance estimation cells, configured 
to interconnect columns and rows according to the vector input components and template 
outputs. Each cell computes in parallel the absolute difference distance between one 
component xj of the input vector x and the corresponding component yij of one of the 
template vectors yi, 
d(xj, yij) __ [Xj -- yij[ , i, j = 1... 16. (1) 
The mean absolute difference (MAD) distance between input and template vectors is 
accumulated along rows

and presented to the WTA, which selects the single winner 
k TM = argm.in3(x, y/) . (3)

Additional parts are included in the architecture for binary encoding of the winning 
output, and for address selection to write and refresh the template vectors. 
3 VLSI Circuit Implementation 
The circuit implementation of the major components of the VQ, for MAD distance 
estimation and WTA selection, is described below. Both MAD distance and WTA cells 
operate in clocked synchronous mode using a precharge/evaluate scheme in the voltage 
domain. The approach followed here offers a wide analog voltage range of inputs and 
templates at low power weak-inversion MOS operation, and a fast and decisive settling of 
the winning output using a single communication line for global positive feedback. The 
output encoding and address decoding circuitry are implemented using standard CMOS 
logic.

3.1 Distance Estimation Cell 
The schematic of the distance estimation cell, replicated along rows and columns of 
the VQ array, is shown in Figure 1 (a). The cell contains two source followers, which 
buffer the input voltage xj and the template voltage ytj. The template voltage is stored 
dynamically onto Cstore, written or refreshed by activating WRi while the yj value is 
presented on the xj input line. The WRi and WRi signal levels along rows of the VQ 
array are driven by the address decoder, which selects a single template vector yi to be 
written to with data presented at the input x when WR is active. 
Additional lateral transistors connect symmetrically to the source follower outputs xj' 
i t 
and y j. By means of resi.stive division, the lateral transistors construct the maximum 
! 
and minimum of xj' and y' ai ,i Lo 
j on j and aij , respectively. In particular, when xj is 
much larger than y t j, the voltage z  j HI approaches x/ and the voltage zij L� approaches 
i t 
y.j. By symmetry, the complementary argument holds in case xj is much smaller than 
� LO 
y'j. Therefore, the differential component of aijI and  approximately represents the 
absolute difference value of x and y'j:

with tc the MOS back gate effect coefficient [7]. 
The mean absolute difference (MAD) distances (2) are obtained by accumulating con-

tributions (4) along rows of cells through capacitive coupling, using the well known 
technique of correlated double sampling. To this purpose, a coupling capacitor Cc is 
provided in every cell, coupling its differential output to the corresponding output row 
line. In the precharge phase, the maximum values zij  are coupled to the output by 
activating HI, and the output lines are preset to reference voltage Vref by activating PRE, 
Figure 1 (b). In the evaluate phase, PRE is de-activated, and the minimum values zi? � 
are coupled to the output by activating LO. From (4), the resulting voltage outputs on 
the floating row lines are given by

The last term in (5) corresponds directly to the distance measure t(x, yi) in (2). Notice 
that the negative sign in (5) could be reversed by interchanging clocks HI and LO, if 
needed. Since the subsequent WTA stage searches for maximum z i, the inverted distance 
metric is in the form needed for VQ. 
Characteristics of the MAD distance estimation (5), measured directly on the VQ ar- 
ray with uniform inputs xj and templates yij, are shown in Figure 2. The magnified 
view in Figure 2 (b) clearly illustrates the effective smoothing of the absolute difference 
function (4) near the origin, xj  yij. The smoothing is caused by the shift in xj' and 
yij  due to the conductance of the lateral coupling transistors connected to the source 
follower outputs in Figure 1 (a), and extends over a voltage range comparable to the 
thermal voltage kT/q depending on the relative geometry of the transistors and current 
bias level of the source followers. The observed width of the flat region in Figure 2 
spans roughly 60 mV, and shows little variation for bias current settings below 0.5 
Tuning of the bias current allows to balance speed and power dissipation requirements, 
since the output response is slew-rate limited by the source followers. 
3.2 Winner-Take-All Circuitry 
The circuit implementation of the winner-take-all (WTA) function combines the com- 
pact sizing and modularity of a linear architecture as in [4,8,9] with positive feedback 
for fast and decisive output settling independent of signal levels, as in [6,3]. Typical 
positive feedback structures for WTA operation use a logarithmic tree [6] or a fully 
interconnected network [3], with implementation complexities of order O(n log n) and 
O(n 2) respectively, n being the number of WTA inputs. The present implementation fea- 
tures an O(n) complexity in a linear structure by means of globalized positive feedback, 
communicated over a single line. 
The schematic of the WTA cell, receiving the input z i and constructing the digital output 
d/through global competition communicated over the COMM line, is shown in Figure 3. 
The global COMM line is source connected to input transistor Mi and positive feedback 
transistor Mf, and receives a constant bias current lb (^) from Mbl. Locally, the WTA 
operation is governed by the dynamics of d.' on (parasitic) capacitor Cp. A high pulse

on RST, resetting di' to zero, marks the beginning of the WTA cycle. With Mf initially 
inactive, the total bias current n lb (wT^ through COMM is divided over all competing 
WTA cells, according to the relative z i voltage levels, and each cell fraction is locally 
mirrored by the Mml-Mm2 pair onto d/, charging Cp. The cell with the highest z i input 
voltage receives the largest fraction of bias current, and charges C/ at the highest rate.
