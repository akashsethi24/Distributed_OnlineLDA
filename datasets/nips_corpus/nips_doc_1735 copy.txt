Abstract 
A system emulating the functionality of a moving eye hence the name 
oculo-motor system--has been built and successfully tested. It is made 
of an optical device for shifting the field of view of an image sensor by up 
to 45 o in any direction, four neuromorphic analog VLSI circuits imple- 
menting an oculo-motor control loop, and some off-the-shelf electronics. 
The custom integrated circuits communicate with each other primarily by 
non-arbitrated address-event buses. The system implements the behav- 
iors of saliency-based saccadic exploration, and smooth pursuit of light 
spots. The duration of saccades ranges from 45 ms to 100 ms, which is 
comparable to human eye performance. Smooth pursuit operates on light 
sources moving at up to 50 �/s in the visual field. 
I INTRODUCTION 
Inspiration from biology has been recognized as a seminal approach to address some en- 
gineering challenges, particularly in the computational domain [1]. Researchers have bor- 
rowed architectures, operating principles and even micro-circuits from various biological 
neural structures and turned them into analog VLSI circuits [2]. Neuromorphic approaches 
are often considered to be particularly suited for machine vision, because even simple 
animals are fitted with neural systems that can easily outperform most sequential digital 
computers in visual processing tasks. It has long been recognized that the level of visual 
processing capability needed for practical applications would require more circuit area than 
can be fitted on a single chip. This observation has triggered the development of inter-chip 
communication schemes suitable for neuromorphic analog VLSI circuits [3]-[4], enabling 
the combination of several chips into a system capable of addressing tasks of higher com- 
plexity. Despite the availability of these communication protocols, only few successful 
implementations of multi-chip neuromorphic systems have been reported so far (see [5] for 
a review). The present contribution reports the completion of a fully functional multi-chip 
system emulating the functionality of a moving eye, hence the denomination oculo-motor 
system. It is made of two 2D VLSI retina chips, two custom analog VLSI control chips, 
dedicated optical and mechanical devices and off-the-shelf electronic components. The 
four neuromorphic chips communicate mostly by pulse streams mediated by non-arbitrated 
address-event buses [4]. In its current version, the system can generate saccades (quick eye

movements) toward salient points of the visual scene, and track moving light spots. The 
purpose of the saccadic operating mode is to explore the visual scene efficiently by allo- 
cating processing time proportionally to significance. The purpose of tracking (also called 
smooth pursuit) is to slow down or suppress the retina image slip of moving objects in order 
to leave visual circuitry more time for processing. The two modes--saccadic exploration 
and smooth pursuit operate concurrently and interact with each other. The development 
of this oculo-motor system was meant as a framework in which some general issues per- 
tinent to neuromorphic engineering could be addressed. In this respect, it complements 
Horiuchi's pioneering work [6]-[7], which consisted of developing a 1D model of the pri- 
mate oculo-motor system with a focus on automatic on-chip learning of the correct control 
function. The new system addresses different issues, notably 2D operation and the problem 
of strongly non-linear mapping between 2D visual and motor spaces. 
2 SYSTEM DESCRIPTION 
The oculo-motor system is made of three modules (Fig. 1). The moving eye module con- 
tains a 35 by 35 pixels electronic retina [8] fitted with a light deflection device driven by two 
motors. This device can shift the field of view of the retina by up to 45 o in any direction. 
The optics are designed to cover only a narrow field of view of about 12 o. Thereby, the 
retina serves as a high-resolution spotlight gathering details of interesting areas of the 
visual scene, similarly to the fovea of animals. Two position control loops implemented 
by off-the-shelf components keep the optical elements in the position specified by input 
signals applied to this module. The other modules control the moving eye in two types 
of behavior, namely saccadic exploration and smooth pursuit. They are implemented as 
physically distinct printed circuit boards which can be enabled or disabled independently.

The light deflection device is made of two transparent and flat disks with a micro-prism 
grating on one side, mounted perpendicularly to the optical axis of a lens. Each disk can 
rotate without restriction around this axis, independently from the other. As a whole, each 
micro-prism grating acts on light essentially like a single large prism, except that it takes 
much less space (Fig. 2). Although a single fixed prism cannot have an adjustable de- 
flection angle, with two mobile prisms, any magnitude and direction of deflection within 
some boundary can be selected, because the two contributions may combine either con-

structively or destructively depending on the relative prism orientations. The relationship 
between prism orientations and deflection angle has been derived in [9]. The advantage of 
this system over many other designs is that only two small passive optical elements have 
to move whereas most of the components are fixed, which enables fast movements and 
avoids electrical connections to moving parts. The drawback of this principle is that optical 
aberrations introduced by the prisms degrade image quality. However, when the device is 
used in conjunction with a typical electronic retina, this degradation is not limiting because 
these image sensors are characterized by a modest resolution due to focal-plane electronic 
processing.

The saccadic exploration module (Fig. 1) consists of an additional retina fitted with a 
fixed wide-angle lens, and a neuromorphic saccadic control chip. The retina gathers low- 
resolution information from the whole visual scene accessible to the moving eye, deter- 
mines the degree of interest or saliency [10] of every region and transmits the resulting 
saliency distribution to the saccadic control chip. In the current version of the system, the 
distribution of saliency is just the raw output image of the retina, whereby saliency is deter- 
mined by the brightness of visual scene locations. By inserting additional visual processing 
hardware between the retina and the saccadic control chip, it would be possible to generate 
interest for more sophisticated cues like edges, motion or specific shapes or patterns. The 
saccadic control chip (Fig. 3) determines the sequence and timing of an endless succes- 
sion of quick jumps or saccades to be executed by the moving eye, in such a way that 
salient locations are attended longer and more frequently than less significant locations. 
The chip contains a 2D array of about 900 cells, which is called visual map because its 
organization matches the topology of the visual field accessible by the moving eye. The 
chip also contains two 1D arrays of 64 cells called motor maps, which encode micro-prism 
orientations in the light deflection device. Each cell of the visual map is externally stim- 
ulated by a stream of brief pulses, the frequency of which encodes saliency. The cells 
integrate incoming pulses over time on a capacitor, thereby building up an internal voltage 
at a rate proportional to pulse frequency. A global comparison circuit called winner- 
take-all--selects the cell with the highest internal voltage. In the winning cell, a leakage 
mechanism slowly decrease the internal voltage over time, thereby eventually leading an- 
other cell to win. With this principle, any cell stimulated to some degree wins from time 
to time. The frequency of winning and the time ellapsed until another cell wins increases 
with saliency. The visual map and the two motor maps are interconnected by a so-called 
network of links [9], which embodies the mapping between visual and motor spaces. This 
network consists of a pair of wires running from each visual cell to one cell in each of the 
two motor maps. Thereby, the winning cell in the visual map stimulates exactly one cell in

each motor map. The location of the active cell in a motor map encodes the orientation of 
a micro-prism grating, therefore this representation convention is called place coding [9]. 
The addresses of the active cells on the motor maps are transmitted to the moving eye, 
which triggers micro-prism displacements toward the specified orientations.
