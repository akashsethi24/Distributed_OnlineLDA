Abstract 
An analog CMOS VLSI neural processing chip has been designed and fabri- 
cated. The device employs pulse-stream neural state siLmalling, and is capa- 
ble of computing some 360 million symaptic connections per second. In addi- 
tion to basic characterisation results. the performance of the chip in solving 
real-world problems is also demonstrated. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
Inspired by biology. and home out of a deshe to perform analogue computation with fun- 
damentally digital fabrication processes, the so-called pulse-stream arithmetic system 
has been steadily evolved and improved since its inception in 1986 (Murray1990a, Mur- 
ray1989a). In addition to this continuous development at Edinburgh, many other research 
groups around the world (most notably Meador et al (Meador1990a)) have experimented 
with their own pulse-firing neural circuits. 
In pulsed implementations, each neural state is represented by some variable attribute 
(e.g. the width of fixed fieXlUency pulses, or the rate of fixed width pulses) of a train (or 
stream) of pulses. The neuron design therefore reduces to a form of oscillator. Each 
neuron is fed by a column of syaapses, which multiply incoming neural States by the 
synaptic weights. In contrast with the original circuits of Murray and Smith (Mur- 
ray1987a), the synapse design which will be discussed herein utilises analog circuit tech- 
niqnes to perform the multiplication of neural state by synal>tic weight. 
This paper describes the Edinburgh Pulse-Stream Implementation of a Learning Oriented 
Network (EPSILON) chip. EPSILON was developed as a flexible neural processor, capa- 
ble of addressing a variety of applications. The main design criteria were as follows: 
� That it be large enough to be of use in practical problems. 
� It should be capable of implementing networks of arbitrary size and architecture. 
� It must be able to act as both a slave accelerat to a conventional computer, and as 
an auto!lomous procsor. 
As will be seen, these constraints resulted in a chip which could realise only a single lay- 
er of synaptic weights, but which could be cascaded to form large, useful networks for 
solving real-world problems.

The remaining sections of this paper describe the attributes of pulse-coded neural systems 
in general, before detailing the circuits which were employed on EPSIIX)N. Finally. re- 
suits from a vowel recognition application are presented, in order to illustrate the perfor- 
mance of EPSH.DN when applied to real tasks. 
2 PULSE CODED NEURAL SYSTEMS 
As already mentioned, EPSILON is a pulse coded analog neural processing chip. In such 
implementations, neural sUtes are encoded as digital pulses. The sutes themselves may 
then be represented either by varying the width of the pulses (pulse width modulation -- 
PWM), or by varying the rate of the pulses (pulse frequency modulation -- PFM). The 
arguments for using pulses in this way are strong. Firsfly, they provide a very effective 
and robust method for communicating sutes both on- and between-chip, since pulses are 
extremely resistant to noise. Secondly, the use of pulses to represent states renders inter- 
facing to digital circuits and computer peripherals straightforward. Finally, pulsed sig- 
nalling leads to simplification of artlhmetic circuits (i.e. synapses), resulting in much 
higher inter-connection densities. 
Unfortunately, pulse-based systems do have drawbacks. In common with all analog cir- 
cuits, the synaptic computing elements have limited precision (usually equivalent to 
about 7 bits), and their performance is subject to the vagaries of fabrication process varia- 
tions. This results in a situation whereby supposedly matched circuits vary markedly in 
theit characteristics. Furthermore, the switching which is inherent in any pulsed circuit 
results in increased levels of system noise, most usna!!y in the form of power supply tran- 
sients. An additional problem with pulse frequency modulation (PFM) systems is that 
computation rates are dependent on the data; this is an important consideration in speed- 
critical applications. 
3 THE EPSILON DESIGN 
This section describes the circuits which were used in the EPSILON design. The operat- 
ing principles of each circuit are discussed, and characterisation results presented. In ac- 
cordance with the demerits mentioned in the previous section. all circuits were designed 
to be tolerant to noise and process variations, to cause as little noise as possible them- 
selves, and to be easy to set up in practice. Finally, the specification of the EPSILON 
chip is presented. 
3.1 SYNAPSE 
The synapse design was based on the standard transconductance multiplier circuit, which 
had previously been the basis for monolithic 8nalogue transversal filters for use in signal 
processing applications (Denyer1981a). Such multipliers use MOS transistors in their 
linear region of operation to generate output currents proportional to a product of two in- 
put voltages. This concept was adapted for use in pulsed neural networks by fLxing one of 
the input voltages, and using a neural sure to gate the output current. In this manner, the 
synapfic weight controls the magnitude of the output current, which is multiplied by the 
incoming neural pulses. The resultant charge packets are subsequently integrated to yield 
the total post-synaptic activity voltage. 
Figure 1 shows the basic pulsed multiplier cell, where M1 and M2 form the transconduc- 
tance multiplier, and M3 is the output pulse transistor. By ensuring that the drain-source 
voltages for M1 and M2 are the same and constant (the differential amplifier and transis- 
tors M4 and M5 are used to satisfy this constraint), non-linearifies in the transistor re- 
sponses can be cancelled ont, such that 1ov r is linearly dependent on the difference of 
Vas and Vas,, (Murray1992a). Multiplication is achieved by pulsing thi. currem by the 
neural state, V. An instantaneous representation of the aggregated post-synaptic activ- 
ity is given by the output voltage, Voor; this must subsequently be integrated in order to 
provide an activity input to a neuron.

Figure 2: Synapse Characterisation Results 
Results from characterisation tests of the synapse are presented in Figure 2, which shows 
output state against input state, for different synapfic weight voltages. As seen from the 
Figure, the linearity of the synapses, with respect to input state, is very high. The varia- 
tion of synapse response with synaptic weight voltage is also fairly uniform. The graphs 
depict mean performance over all the synaptic columns in all the chips tested. The associ- 
ated standard deviations were more or less constant, representing a variation of approxi- 
mately + 300 ns in the values of the output pulse widths. The effects of intra- and inter- 
chip process mismatches would therefore seem to be well contained by the circuit design. 
The zero point in the synaptic weight range was set at 3.75 V and, as can be seen from 
the Figure, each graph shows an offset problem when the input neural state is zero. This 
was attributable to an imbalance in the operating conditions of the transistors in the 
synapse, induced by the non-ideal nature of the power supplies (i.e. the non-zero sheet 
resistance of the power supply tracks), resulting in an offset in the input voltage to the 
post-synaptic integrator. This problem is easily obviated in practice, by employing three 
synapses per column to cancel the offset.

3.2 NEURONS 
In order to reflect the diversity of neural network forms. and possible applications. two 
different neuron desi.q were included on the EPSILON chip. The first, a synchronous 
pulse width modulation neuron was desitmed with vision applications in mind. This cir- 
cuit could guarantee network computation times, thereby eliminating the data dependen- 
cy inherent in pulse frequency systems. The second neuron design used asynchronous 
pulse frequency modulation; the asynchronous nature of these circuits is advantageous in 
feedback and recurrent neural architectures, where temporal characteristics are important. 
As with the synapse, both circuits were designed to miniraise transient noise injection, 
and to be tolerant of process variations. 
3.2.1 Pulse Width Modulation 
As already stated, this system retains all the advantages of using pulses for commuaica- 
fion/calculation, whilst being able to guarantee a maximum network evaluation time. In 
the first instance. the main disadvantage with this technique appeared to be its syn- 
chronous nature - neurons would all be switching together causing larger power supply 
transients than in an asynchronous system. This problem has, however. been circumvent- 
ed via a double-sided pulse modulation scheme. which will be more fully explained lat-
