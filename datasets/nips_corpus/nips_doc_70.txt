ABSTRACT
Various simulations o� cortical subnetworks have evidenced 
something like phase transitions with respect to key parameters. 
We demonstrate that. such transitions must. indeed exist_ in analogous 
in�inite array models. For related �inite array models classical 
phase transit.ions (which describe steady-state behavior) may not. 
exist., but. there can be distinct. qualitative changes in 
(metastable) transient. behavior as key system parameters pass 
through critical values. 
INTRODUCTION 
Suppose that. one st.imulates a neural network - actual or 
simulated - and in some manner records the subsequent �iring 
activity o� cells. Suppose �urther that. one repeats the experiment. 
�or di��erent values o� some parameter (p) o� the system: and that. 
one �inds a critical value (pc) o� the parameter, such that. 
(say) �or values P ) Pc the activity tends to be much higher than 
it. is �or values P < Pc' Then, by analogy with statistical 
mechanics (where, e.g., p may be temperature, with critical 
values �or boiling and �reezing) one can say that. the neural 
network undergoes a phase transition at. Pc' Intracellular phase 
transitions, parametrized by membrane potential, are well known. 
Here we consider intercellular phase transitions. These have been 
evidenced in several detailed cortical simulations: e.g., of the 
pitiform cortex 1 and of the hippocampus 2 In the pitiform case, 
the parameter p represented the frequency of high amplitude 
spontaneous EPSPs received by a typical pyramidal cell; in the 
hippocampal case, the parameter was the ratio of inhibitory to 
excitatory cells in the system. 
By what. mechanisms could approach to, and retreat. from, a 
critical value of some parameter be brought about? An intriguing 
conjecture is that. neuromodulators can play such a role in certain 
3 
networks; temporarily raising or depressing synaptic efficacies 
What. possible interesting consequences could approach to 
criticality have for system performance. Good effects could be 
these: for a network with plasticity, heightened firing response 
to a stimulus can mean faster changes in synaptic e�ficacies, which 
would bring about_ faster memory storage. More and longer activity 
could also mean faster access to memory. A bad effect. o�

near-criticality - depending on other parameters - can be wild, 
epilepti�orm activity. 
Phase transitions as they might. relate to neural networks have 
4 
been studied by many authors Here, �or clarity, we look at. a 
particular category o� network models - abstracted �rom the 
piri�orm cortex setting re�erred to above - and show the �ollowing: 
a) For elementary reasons, phase transition would have to 
exist i� there were in�initely many cells; and the near-subcritical 
state involves prolonged cellular �iring activity in response to an 
initial stimulation. 
b) Such prolonged �iring activity takes place �or analogous 
large �inite cellular arrays - as evidenced also by computer 
simulations. 
What. we shall be examining is space-time patterns which 
describe the mid-term transient. activity o� (Markovian) systems 
that. tend to silence (with high probability) in the long run. 
(There is no re�erence to energy �unctions, nor to long-run stable 
�iring rates - as such rates would be zero in most. o� our cases.) 
In the �ollowing models time will proceed in discrete steps. 
(In the more complicated settings these will be short. in comparison 
to other time constants, so that_ the e��ect o� quantization becomes 
smaller.) The parameter p will be the probability that at. any 
given time a given cell will experience a certain amount. o� 
excitatory spontaneous �iring input.: by itsel� this amount. will 
be insu��icient. to cause the cell to �ire, but. in conjunction with 
su��iciently many excitatory inputs �rom other cells it. can assist. 
in reaching �iring threshold. (Other related parameters such as 
average �iring threshold value and average e�ficcy value give 
similar results.) In all the models there is a refractory period 
after a cell fires, during which it cannot fire again; and there 
may be local (shunt. type) inhibition by a firing cell on near 
neighbors as well as on itself - but. there is no long-distance 
inhibition. We look first. at. limiting cases where there are 
infinitely many cells and - classically - phase transition appears 
in a sharp �orm. 
A SIMPLE MODEL 
We consider an infinite linear array of similar cells which 
obey the following rules, pictured in Fig. 1A: 
(i) If cell k fires at. time n, then it. must. be silent. 
at. time n+l; 
(ii) if cell 
neighbors k-1 and 
at. time n+l; 
(iii) if cell k is silent at time n and Just one of its 
neighbors (k-1 or k+l) fires at. time n, then cell k will 
fire at time n+l with probability p and not. fire with 
probability l-p, independently of similar decisions at. other 
cells and at. other times. 
k is silent. at. time n but. both of its 
k+l do fire at. time n, then cell k fires

Fig. 1. Simple model. A: firing rules; cells are represented 
horizontally, time proceeds downwards; filled squares 
denote firing. B: sample development. 
Thus, ef�ecttvely, signal propagation speed here is one cell 
per unit. time, and a cell's firing threshold value is 2 (EPSP 
units). I{ we stimulate one cell to {ire at time n--O, will its 
influence necessarily die out or can it. go on forever? (See 
Fig. lB.) For an answer we note that. in this simple case the 
firing pattern (if any) at. time n must. be an alternating stretch 
o{ firing/silent cells o{ some length, call it. L . Moreover, 
n 
2 
Ln+ 1 = L +2 with probability p (when there are sponteneous 
n 
firing assists on both ends o{ the stretch), or Ln+ 1 = Ln-2 with 
probability (l-p) 2 (when there is no assist at. either. end o{ the 
stretch), or Ln+ 1 = L n with probability 2p(1-p) (when there is 
an assist. at. just. one end o{ the stretch). 
Starting with any finite alternating stretch L O, the 
successive values L constitute a random walk among the 
n 
nonnegative integers. Intuition and simple analysis 5 lead to the 
same conclusion: i{ the probability {or L n to decrease ((l-p) 2) 
is greater than that_ {or it. to increase (p2) _ i.e. if the average 
step taken by the random walk is negative - then ultimately L 
n 
will reach 0 and the firing response dies out. Contrariwise, i{

n 
positive probability. In Fig. 2A we sketch the probability for 
ultimate die-out as a function of p; and in Fig. 2B, the average 
time until die out. Figs. 2A and B show a classic example of phase 
transition (Pc = 1/2) for this infinite array.

MORE COMPI.EX MODELS 
For an infinite linear array of cells, as sketched in Fig. 3 , 
we describe now a much more general (and hopefully more realistic) 
set. of rules: 
(i') A cell cannot. fire, nor receive excitatory inputs, at. 
time n if it has fired at any time during the preceding m R time 
units (refraction and feedback inhibition). 
(ii') Each cell x has a local inhibitory neighborhood 
consisting of a number (j) of cells to its immediate right. and 
left_, The given cell x cannot. fire or receive excitatory inputs 
at time n if any other cell y in its inhibitory neighborhood 
has fired at_any time between t and t+m I units preceding n, 
where t is the time it. would take for a message to travel from y 
to x at. a speed of v I cells per unit time. (This rule 
represents local shuntstype inhibition.) 
(iii') Each cell x has an excitatory neighborhood 
consisting of a number (e) of cells to the immediate right_and left 
of its inhibitory neighborhood. If a cell y in that. neighborhood 
fires at. a certain time, that firing causes a unit impulse to 
travel to cell x at a speed of v E cells per unit. time. The 
impulse is received at. x subject to rules (i') and (ii'). 
196 
(iv') All cells share a �iring threshold value 0 and an 
integration time constant? s (s (0). In addition each cell, at. 
each time n and independently o� other times and other cells, can 
receive a random amount. X o� spontaneous excitatory input?. 
n 
The variable X can have a general distribution; however, �or 
n 
simplicity we suppose here that. it. assumes only one o� two values: 
b or O, with probabilities p and 1-p respectively. (We 
suppose that. b ('0, so that. the spontaneous assist? itsel� is 
insu��icient. �or �iring.) The above quantities enter into the 
�ollowing firin rule: a cell will fire at. time n if it_ is not. 
prevented by rules (i') and (ii') and i� the total number of inputs 
from other cells, received during the integration window lasting 
between times n-s+l and n inclusive, plus the assist. X n, 
equals or exceeds the threshold O. 
(The propagation speeds v I and V E and the neighborhoods 
are here given leftsright symmetry merely �or ease in exposition.)

Will such a model display phase transition at. some critical 
value of the spontaneous firir frequency p ? The dependence of 
responses upon the initial conditions and upon the various 
parameters is intricate and will a�fect the answer. We briefly 
discuss here conditions under which the answer is again yes. 
(1) For a given configuration of parameters and a given 
initial stimulation (of a stretch of cont.iuous cells) we compare 
the development. of the model's firing response first. to that. of an 
auxiliary more active system: Suppose that. L now denotes the 
n 
distance at. time n between the left and right-most cells
