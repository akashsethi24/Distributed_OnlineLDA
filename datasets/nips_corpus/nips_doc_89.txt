Abstract 
A family of neuromorphic networks specifically designed for communications 
and optical signal processing applications is presented. The information is encoded 
utilizing sparse Optical Orthogonal Code sequences on the basis of unipolar, binary 
(0, 1) signals. The generalized synaptic connectivity matrix is also unipolar, and 
clipped to binary (0, 1) values. In addition to high-capacity associative memory, 
the resulting neural networks can be used to implement general functions, such as 
code filtering, code mapping, code joining, code shifting and code projecting. 
1 Introduction 
Synthetic neural nets [1,2] represent an active and growing research field. Fundamental 
issues, as well as practical implementations with electronic and optical devices are being 
studied. In addition, several learning algorithms have been studied, for example stochas- 
tically adaptive systems[ 3] based on many-body physics optimization concepts[ 4,5]. 
Signal processing in the optical domain has also been an active field of research. 
A wide variety of non-linear all-optical devices are being studied, directed towards ap- 
plications both in optical computating and in optical switching. In particular, the 
development of Optical Orthogonal Codes (OOC) [6] is specifically interesting to opti- 
c01 communications applications, as it has been demonstrated in the context of Code 
Division Multiple Access (CDMA)[ 7]. 
In this paper we present a new class of neuromorphic networks, specifically designed 
for optical signal processing and communications, that encode the information in sparse 
OOC's. In Section 2 we review some basic concepts. The new neuromorphic networks 
are defined in Section 3, and their associative memory properties are presented in Section 
4. In Section 5 other general network functions are discussed. Concluding remarks are 
given in Section 6. 
2 Neural Networks and Optical Orthogonal Codes 
2.1 Neural Network Model 
Neural network are generally based on multiply-threshold-feedback cycles. In the Hop- 
field model[ 2], for instance, a connectivity  matrix stores the M different memory 
elements, labeled m, by the sum of outer products, 
M 
i,J: 
American Institute of Physics 1988 
815 
where the state vectors _u TM represent the memory elements in the bipolar (-1, 1) basis. 
The diagonal matrix elements in the Hopfield model are set to zero, Til - 0. 
For a typical memory recall cycle, an input vector _v i', which is close to a particular 
memory element rn = k, multiplies the  matrix, such that the output vector v �t is 
given by 
N 
i,j = (2) 
j=l 
and can be seen to reduce to 
(N - + v/(N- 1)(M- 1) 
(3) 
for large N and in the case of randomly coded memory elements u_ TM. 
In the Hopfield model, each output o,t is passed through a thresholding stage 
around zero. The thresholded output signals are then fed back, and the multiply and 
threshold cycle is repeated until a final stable output v_ �t is obtained. If the input v__ i' is 
sufficiently close to u?, and the number of state vectors is small (i.e. M << N), the final 
output will converge to memory element m = k, that is, _v �t  _u k. The associative 
memory property of the network is thus established. 
2.2 Optical Orthogonal Codes 
The OOC sequences have been developed [6'7] for optical CDMA systems. Their prop- 
erties have been specifically designed for this purpose, based on the following two con- 
ditions: each sequence can be easily distinguished from a shifted version of itself, and 
each sequence can be easily distinguished from any other shifted or unshifted sequence 
in the set. Mathematically, the above two conditions are expressed in terms of auto- 
and crosscorrelation functions. Because of the non-negative nature of optical signals , 
OOC are based on unipolar (0, 1) signals [7]. 
In general, a family of OOC is defined by the following parameters: 
- F, the length of the code, 
- K, the weight of the code, that is, the number of 1's in the sequence, 
- ), the auto-correlation value for all possible shifts, other than the zero shift, 
- X, the cross-correlation value for all possible shifts, including the zero shift. 
For a given code length F, the maximum number of distinct sequences in a family 
of OOC depends on the chosen parameters, that is, the weight of the code K and the 
allowed overlap and. In this paper we will consider OOC belonging to the minimum 
overlap class,  = . = 1. 
XWe refer to optical intensity signals, and not to detection systems sensitive to phase information.

3 Neuromorphic Optical Networks 
Our neuromorphic networks are designed to take full advantage of the properties of the 
OOC. The connectivity matrix T is defined as a sum of outer products, by analogy with 
(1), but with the following important modifications: 
The memory vectors are defined by the sequences of a given family of OOC, with a 
basis given by the unipolar, binary pair (0, 1). The dimension of the sparse vectors 
is given by the length of the code F, and the maximum number of available items 
depends on the chosen family of OOC. 
All of the matrix elements Tij are clipped to unipolar, binary (0, 1) values, resulting 
in a sparse and simplified connectivity matrix, without any loss in the functional 
properties defined by our neuromorphic networks. 
3. The diagonal matrix elements Tii are not set to zero, as they reflect important 
information implicit in the OOC sequences. 
4. The threshold value is not zero, but it is chosen to be equal to K, the weight of 
the OOC. 
The connectivity matrix T is generalized to allow for the possibility of a variety 
of outer product options: self-outer products, as in (1), for associative memory, 
but also cross-outer products of different forms to implement various other system 
functions. 
A simplified schematic diagram of a possible optical neuromorphic processor is shown 
in Figure 1. This implementation is equivalent to an incoherent optical matrix-vector 
multiplier [8], with the addition of nonlinear functions. The input vector is clipped using 
an optical hard-limiter with a threshold setting at 1, and then it is anamorphically 
imaged onto the connectivity mask for . In this way, the i h pixel of the input vector 
is imaged onto the i h colunto of the  mask. The light passing through the mask is 
then anamorphically imaged onto a line of optical threshold elements with a threshold 
setting equal to K, such that the jh row is imaged onto the jh threshold element. 
4 Associative Memory 
The associative memory function is defined by a connectivity matrix MEM given by: 
ij =  zz ; i,j - 1,2...F 
(4) 
where each memory element z__ ' corresponds to a given sequence of the OOC family, 
with code length F. The matrix elements of TMEM are all clipped, unipolar values, as 
indicated by the function 6(}, such that, 
(5) 
817 
We will now show that an input vector z_ k, which corresponds to memory element 
m = k, will produce a stable output (equal to the wanted memory vector) in a single 
pass of the multiply and threshold process. 
The multiplication can be written as: 
F 
= j zj 
We remember that the non-linear clipping function {} is to be applied first to obtain 
MEM. Hence, 
(7) 
k = 0, only the second term in (7) contributes, and the pseudo-orthogonality 
For zi 
properties of the OOC allow us to write: 
zj Oiz..  i 
where the cross-correlation value is Ac < K. 
k 1, we again consider the properties of the OOC to obtain for the first term 
For z i = 
of (7): 
F 
Z k k k=Kz 
(9) 
J 
where K is the weight of the O OC. 
Therefore, the result of the multiplication operation given by (7) can be written as: 
o,,t Kz+[valuestrictly] 
i = less than K 
(lO) 
The thresholding operation follows, around the value K as explained in Section 3. 
That is, (10) is thresholded such that: 
v?t _ -- { I if O?t _ K (11) 
0 if O  < K, 
hence, the final output at the end of a single pass will be given by: v t k 
-- gi' 
The result just obtained can be extended to demonstrate the single pass convergence 
when the input vector is close, but not necessarily equal, to a stored memory element. 
We can draw the following conclusions regarding the properties of our neuromorphic 
networks based on OOC: 
� For any given input vector v_ i', the single pass output will correspond to the 
memory vector z__  which has the smallest Hamming distance to the input. 
� If the input vector v_ i' is missing a single 1-element from the K 1's of an OOC, 
the single pass output will be the null or zero vector. 
818 
� If the input vector v_/n has the same Hamming distance to two (or more) memory 
vectors z_ , the single pass output will be the logical sum of those memory vectors. 
The ideas just discussed were tested with a computer simulation. An example of 
associative memory is shown in Table 1, corresponding to the OOC class of length 
F = 21 and weight K = 2. For this case, the maximum number of independent 
sequences is M = 10. The connectivity matrix MEM is seen in Table 1, where one can 
clearly appreciate the simplifying features of our model, both in terms of the sparsity 
and of the unipolar, clipped values of the matrix elements. The computer simulations for 
this example are shown in Table 2. The input vectors a and b show the error-correcting 
memory recovery properties. The input vector c is equally distant to memory vectors 
z s and z_ s, resulting in an output which is the sum (z_ s ( z_s). And finally, input vector 
d is closest to z  but one I is missing, and the output is the zero vector. The mask 
in Figure I shows the optical realization of the Table 1, where the transparent pixels 
correspond to the 1's and the opaque pixels to the O's of the connectivity matrix ME.
