Abstract 
While the understanding of the functional role of different classes 
of neurons in the awake primary visual cortex has been extensively 
studied since the time of Hubel and Wiesel (Hubel and Wiesel, 1962), 
our understanding of the feature selectivity and functional role of 
neurons in the primary auditory cortex is much farther from com- 
plete. Moving bars have long been recognized as an optimal stimulus 
for many visual cortical neurons, and this finding has recently been 
confirmed and extended in detail using reverse correlation methods 
(Jones and Palmer, 1987; Reid and Alonso, 1995; Reid et al., 1991; 
Ringach et al., 1997). In this study, we recorded from neurons in the 
primary auditory cortex of the awake primate, and used a novel re- 
verse correlation technique to compute receptive fields (or preferred 
stimuli), encompassing both multiple frequency components and on- 
going time. These spectrotemporal receptive fields make clear that 
neurons in the primary auditory cortex, as in the primary visual cor- 
tex, typically show considerable structure in their feature processing 
properties, often including multiple excitatory and inhibitory regions 
in their receptive fields. These neurons can be sensitive to stimulus 
edges in frequency composition or in time, and sensitive to stimulus 
transitions such as changes in frequency. These neurons also show 
strong responses and selectivity to continuous frequency modulated 
stimuli analogous to visual drifting gratings. 
1 Introduction 
It is known that auditory neurons are tuned for a number of independent feature 
parameters of simple stimuli including frequency (Merzenich et al., 1973), intensity 
(Sutter and Schreiner, 1995), amplitude modulation (Schreiner and Urbas, 1988), and

others. In addition, auditory cortical responses to multiple stimuli can enhance or sup- 
press one another in a time dependent fashion (Brosch and Schreiner, 1997; Phillips 
and Cynader, 1985; Shamma and Symmes, 1985), and auditory cortical neurons can 
be highly selective for species-specific vocalizations (Wang et al., 1995; Wollberg and 
Newman, 1972), suggesting complex acoustic processing by these cells. It is not yet 
known if these many independent selectivities of auditory cortical neurons reflect a 
discernible underlying pattern of feature decomposition, as has often been suggested 
(Merzenich et al., 1985; Schreiner and Mendelson, 1990; Wang et al., 1995). Further, 
since sustained firing rate responses in the auditory cortex to tonal stimuli are typ- 
ically much lower than visual responses to drifting bars (deCharms and Merzenich, 
1996b), it has been suggested that the preferred type of auditory stimulus may still 
not be known (Nelken et al., 1994). We sought to develop an unbiased method for 
determining the full feature selectivity of auditory cortical neurons, whatever it might 
be, in frequency and time based upon reverse correlation. 
2 Methods 
Recordings were made from a chronic array of up to 49 individually placed ultra- 
fine extracellular Iridium microelectrodes, placed in the primary auditory cortex of 
the adult owl monkey. The electrodes had tip lengths of 10-25microns, which yield 
impedance values of .5-5MOhm and good isolation of signals from individual neurons 
or clusters of nearby neurons. We electrochemically activated these tips to add an 
ultramicroscopic coating of Iridium Oxide, which leaves the tip geometry unchanged, 
but decreases the tip impedance by more than an order of magnitude, resulting in 
substantially improved recording signals. These signals are filtered from .3-8kHz, 
sampled at 20kHz, digitized, and sorted. The stimuli used were a variant of random

white noise which was designed to allow us to characterize the responses of neurons 
in time and in frequency. As shown in figure 1, these stimuli are directly analogous 
to stimuli that have been used previously to characterize the response properties of 
neurons in the primary visual cortex (Jones and Palmer, 1987; Reid and Alonso, 
1995; Reid et al., 1991). In the visual case, stimuli consist of spatial checkerboards 
that span some portion of the two-dimensional visual field and change pattern with 
a short sampling interval. In the auditory case, which we have studied here, the 
stimuli chosen were randomly selected chords, which approximately evenly span a 
126 R. C. deCharms and M. M. Merzenich 
portion of the one-dimensional receptor surface of the cochlea. These stimuli consist 
of combinations of pure tones, all with identical phase and all with 5 msec cosine- 
shaped ramps in amplitude when they individually turn on or off. Each chord was 
created by randomly selecting frequency values from 84 possible values which span 
7 octaves from 110Hz to 14080Hz in even semitone steps. The density of tones in 
each stimulus was 1 tone per octave on average, or 7 tones per chord, but the stimuli 
were selected stochastically so a given chord could be composed of a variable number 
of tones of randomly selected frequencies. We have used sampling rates of 10-100 
chords/second, and the data here are from stimuli with 50 chords/second. Stimuli 
with random, asynchronous onset times of each tone produce similar results. These 
stimuli were presented in the open sound field within an acoustical isolation cham- 
ber at 44.1kHz sampling rate directly from audio compact disk, while the animal sat 
passively in the sound field or actively performed an auditory discrimination task, 
receiving occasional juice rewards. The complete characterization set lasted for ten 
minutes, thereby including 30,000 individual chords. 
Spike trains were collected from multiple sites in the cortex simultaneously during the 
presentation of our characterization stimulus set, and individually reverse correlated 
with the times of onset of each of the tonal stimuli. The reverse correlation method 
computes the number of spikes from a neuron that were detected, on average, during 
a given time preceding, during, or following a particular tonal stimulus component 
from our set of chords. These values are presented in spikes/s for all of the tones 
in the stimulus set, and for some range of time shifts. This method is somewhat 
analogous in intention to a method developed earlier for deriving spectrotemporal 
receptive fields for auditory midbrain neurons (Eggermont et al., 1983), but previous 
methods have not been effective in the auditory cortex. 
3 Results 
Figure 2 shows the spectrotemporal responses of neurons from four locations in the 
primary auditory cortex. In each panel, the time in milliseconds between the onset of 
a particular stimulus component and a neuronal spike is shown along the horizontal 
axis. Progressively greater negative time shifts indicate progressively longer latencies 
from the onset of a stimulus component until the neuronal spikes. The frequency 
of the stimulus component is shown along the vertical axis, in octave spacing from 
a 110Hz standard, with twelve steps per octave. The brightness corresponds to the 
average rate of the neuron, in spk/s, driven by a particular stimulus component. 
The reverse-correlogram is thus presented as a stimulus triggered spike rate average, 
analogous to a standard peristimulus time histogram but reversed in time, and is 
identical to the spectrogram of the estimated optimal stimulus for the cell (a spike 
triggered stimulus average which would be in units of mean stimulus density). 
A minority of neurons in the primary auditory cortex have spectrotemporal recep- 
tive fields that show only a single region of increased rate, which corresponds to the 
traditional characteristic frequency of the neuron, and no inhibitory region. We have 
found that cells of this type (less than 10%, not shown) are less common than cells 
with multimodal receptive field structure. More commonly, neurons have regions of 
both increased and decreased firing rate relative to their mean rate within their re- 
ceptive fields. For terminological convemence, these will be referred to as excitatory 
and inhibitory regions, though these changes in rate are not diagnostic of an under- 
lying mechanism. Neurons with receptive fields of this type can serve as detectors 
of stimulus edges in both frequency space, and in time. The neuron shown in figure 
2a has a receptive field structure indicative of lateral inhibition in frequency space. 
This cell prefers a very narrow range of frequencies, and decreases its firing rate for 
nearby frequencies, giving the characteristic of a sharply-tuned bandpass filter. This
