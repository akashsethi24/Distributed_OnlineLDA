ABSTRACT 
We have used information-theoretic ideas to derive a class of prac- 
tical and nearly optimal schemes for adapting the size of a neural 
network. By removing unimportant weights from a network, sev- 
eral improvements can be expected: better generalization, fewer 
training examples required, and improved speed of learning and/or 
classification. The basic idea is to use second-derivative informa- 
tion to make a tradeoff between network complexity and training 
set error. Experiments confirm the usefulness of the methods on a 
real-world application. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
Most succefful applications of neural network learning to real-world problems have 
been achieved using highly structured networks of rather large size [for example 
(Waibel, 1989; Le Cun et al., 1990a)]. As applications become more complex, the 
networks will presumably become even larger and more structured. Design tools 
and techniques for comparing different architectures and minimizing the network 
size will be needed. More importantly, as the number of parameters in the systems 
increases, overfitting problems may arise, with devastating effects on the general- 
ization performance. We introduce a new technique called Optimal Brain Damage 
(OBD) for reducing the size of a learning network by selectively deleting weights. 
We show that OBD can be used both as an automatic network minimization pro- 
cedure and as an interactive tool to suggest better architectures. 
The basic idea of OBD is that it is possible to take a perfectly reasonable network, 
delete half (or more) of the weights and wind up with a network that works just as 
well, or better. It can be applied in situations where a complicated problem must

be solved, and the system must make optimal use of a limited amount of training 
data. It is known from theory (Denker et al., 1987; Baum and Haussler, 1989; Solla 
et al., 1990) and experience (Le Cun, 1989) that, for a fixed amount of training 
data, networks with too many weights do not generalize well. On the other hand. 
networks with too few weights will not have enough power to represent the data 
accurately. The best generalization is obtained by trading off the training error and 
the network complexity. 
One technique to reach this tradeoff is to minimize a cost function composed of two 
terms: the ordinary training error, plus some measure of the network complexity. 
Several such schemes have been proposed in the statistical inference literature [see 
(Akaike, 1986; Rissanen, 1989; Vapnik, 1989) and references therein] as well as in 
the NN literature (Rumelhart, 1988; Chauvin, 1989; Hanson and Pratt, 1989; Mozer 
and Smolensky, 1989). 
Various complexity measures have been proposed, including Vapnik-Chervonenkis 
dimensionality (Vapnik and Chervonenkis, 1971) and description length (Rissanen, 
1989). A time-honored (albeit inexact) measure of complexity is simply the number 
of non-zero free parameters, which is the measure we choose to use in this paper 
[but see (Denker, Le Cun and Solla, 1990)]. Free parameters are used rather than 
connections, since in constrained networks, several connections can be controlled by 
a single parameter. 
In most cases in the statistical inference literature, there is some a priori or heuristic 
information that dictates the order in which parameters should be deleted; for 
example, in a family of polynomials, a smoothness heuristic may require high-order 
terms to be deleted first. In a neural network, however, it is not at all obvious in 
which order the parameters should be deleted. 
A simple strategy consists in deleting parameters with small saliency, i.e. those 
whose deletion will have the least effect on the training error. Other things be- 
ing equal, small-magnitude parameters will have the least saliency, so a reasonable 
initial strategy is to train the network and delete small-magnitude parameters in 
order. After deletion, the network should be refrained. Of course this procedure 
can be iterated; in the limit it reduces to continuous weight-decay during training 
(using disproportionately rapid decay of small-magnitude parameters). In fact, sev- 
eral network minimization schemes have been implemented using non-proportional 
weight decay (Rumelhart, 1988; Chauvin, 1989; Hanson and Pratt, 1989), or gat- 
ing coecients (Mozer and Smolensky, 1989). Generalization performance has 
been reported to increase significantly on the somewhat small problems examined. 
Two drawbacks of these techniques are that they require fine-tuning of the prun- 
ing coecients to avoid catastrophic effects, and also that the learning process 
is significantly slowed down. Such methods include the implicit hypothesis that 
the appropriate measure of network complexity is the number of parameters (or 
sometimes the number of units) in the network. 
One of the main points of this paper is to move beyond the approximation that 
magnitude equals saliency, and propose a theoretically justified saliency measure.

Our technique uses the second derivative of the objective function with respect to 
the parameters to compute the saliencies. The method was walidated using our 
handwritten digit recognition network trained with backpropagation (Le Cun et al., 
1990b). 
2 OPTIMAL BRAIN DAMAGE 
Objective functions play a central role in this field; therefore it is more than rca- 
sonable to define the saliency of a parameter to be the change in the objective 
function caused by deleting that parameter. It would be prohibitively laborious to 
evaluate the saliency directly from this definition, i.e. by temporarily deleting each 
parameter and reevaluating the objective function. 
Fortunately, it is possible to construct a local model of the error function and 
analytically predict the effect of perturbing the parameter vector. We approximate 
the objective function E by a Taylor series. A perturbation ' of the parameter 
vector will change the objective function by 
(1) 
Here, the i's are the components ofiU, the gi'S are the components of the gradient 
G of E with respect to U, and the hij's are the elements of the Hessian matrix H 
of E with respect to U: 
OE O:E 
gi '- Oi and hij- OuiOuj (2) 
The goal is to find a set of parameters whose deletion will cause the least increase 
of E. This problem is practically insoluble in the general case_ One reason is 
that the matrix H is enormous (6.5 x 106 terms for our 2600 parameter network), 
and is very difficult to compute. Therefore we must introduce some simplifying 
approximations. The diagonal approximation assumes that the iE caused by 
deleting several parameters is the sum of the iE's caused by deleting each parameter 
individually; cross terms are neglected, so third term of the right hand side of 
equation I is discarded. The extremal approximation assumes that parameter 
deletion will be performed after training has converged. The parameter vector is 
then at a (local) minimum of E and the first term of the right hand side of equation 1 
can be neglected. Furthermore, at a local minimum, all the hii'$ are non-negative, 
so any perturbation of the parameters will cause E to increase or stay the same. 
Thirdly, the quadratic approximation assumes that the cost function is nearly 
quadratic so that the last term in the equation can be neglected. Equation I then 
reduces to

2.1 COMPUTING THE SECOND DERIVATIVES 
Now we need an efficient way of computing the diagonal second derivatives hii. 
Such a procedure was derived in (Le Cun, 1987), and was the basis of a fast back- 
propagation method used extensively in ,arious applications (Becker and Le Cun, 
1989; Le Cun, 1989; Le Cun et al., 1990a). The procedure is very similar to the 
back-propagation algorithm used for computing the first derivatives. We will only 
outline the procedure; details can be found in the references. 
We assume the objective function is the usual mean-squared error (MSE); general- 
ization to other additive error measures is straightforward. The following expres- 
sions apply to a single input pattern; afterward E and H must be averaged over 
the training set. The network state is computed using the standard formulae 
zi = f(ai) and ai = Z wijzj (4) 
where zi is the state of unit i, ai its total input (weighted sum), jr the squashing 
function and wij is the connection going from unit j to unit i. In a shared-weight 
network like ours, a single parameter ut can control one or more connections: wij = 
ut for all (i, j)  Vt, where Vt is a set of index pairs. By the chain rule, the diagonal 
terms of H are given by 
02E 
(ij)v 
The summand can be expanded (using the basic network equations 4) as: 
02E OE 2 
Ow. = 
(6) 
The second derivatives are back-propagated from layer to layer: 
02E x'-' 202E f a, OE 
= ( ') 
(7) 
We also need the boundary condition at the output layer, specifying the second 
derivative of E with respect to the last-layer weighted sums: 
02E 
Oa = 2f'(ai)- 2(di- zi)f(ai) (8) 
for all units i in the output layer. 
As can be seen, computing the diagonal Hessian is of the same order of complexity 
as computing the gradient. In some cases, the second term of the right hand side of 
the last two equations (involving the second derivative of f) can be neglected. This 
corresponds to the well-known Levenberg-Marquardt approximation, and has the 
interesting property of giving guaranteed positive estimates of the second derivative.

2.2 THE RECIPE 
The OBD procedure can be carried out as follows: 
1. Choose a reasonable network architecture 
2. Train the network until a reasonable solution is obtained 
3. Compute the second derivatives hkk for each parameter
