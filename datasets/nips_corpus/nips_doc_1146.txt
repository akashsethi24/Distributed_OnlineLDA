Abstract 
We employed a white-noise velocity signal to study the dynamics 
of the response of single neurons in the cortical area MT to visual 
motion. Responses were quantified using reverse correlation, opti- 
mal linear reconstruction filters, and reconstruction signal-to-noise 
ratio (SNR). The SNR and lower bound estimates of information 
rate were lower than we expected. Ninety percent of the informa- 
tion was transmitted below 18 Hz, and the highest lower bound on 
bit rate was 12 bits/s. A simulated opponent motion energy sub- 
unit with Poisson spike statistics was able to out-perform the MT 
neurons. The temporal integration window, measured from the re- 
verse correlation half-width, ranged from 30-90 ms. The window 
was narrower when a stimulus moved faster, but did not change 
when temporal frequency was held constant. 
I INTRODUCTION 
Area MT neurons can show precise and rapid modulation in response to dynamic 
noise stimuli (Bait and Koch, 1996); however, computational models of these neu- 
rons and their inputs (Adelson and Bergen, 1985; Heeger, 1987; Grzywacz and 
Yuille, 1990; Emerson et al., 1992; Qian et al., 1994; Nowlan and Sejnowski, 1995) 
have primarily been compared to electrophysiological results based on time and en- 
semble averaged responses to deterministic stimuli, e.g., drifting sinusoidal gratings. 
Reconstructing Stimulus Velocity from Neuronal Responses in Area MT 35 
Using methods introduced by Bialek et al. (1991) and further analyzed by Gabbiani 
and Koch (1996) for the estimation of information transmission by a neuron about 
a white-noise stimulus, we set out to compare the responses of MT neurons for 
white-noise velocity signals to those of a model based on opponent motion energy 
sub-units. 
The results of two analyses are summarized here. In the first, we compute a lower 
bound on information transmission using optimal linear reconstruction filters and 
examine the SNR as a function of temporal frequency. The second analysis examines 
changes in the reverse correlation (the cross-correlation between the stimulus and 
the resulting spike trains) as a function of spatial frequency and temporal frequency 
of the moving stimulus pattern. 
2 EXPERIMENTAL METHODS 
Spike trains were recorded extracellularly from 26 well-isolated single neurons in area 
MT of four anesthetized, paralyzed macaque monkeys using methods described in 
detail elsewhere (Levitt et al., 1994). The size of the receptive fields and the spatial 
and temporal frequency preferences of the neurons were assessed quantitatively 
using drifting sinusoidal gratings, after which a white-noise velocity signal, s(t), 
was used to modulate the position (within a fixed square aperture) of a low-pass 
filtered 1D Gaussian white-noise (GWN) pattern. The frame rate of the display 
was 54 Hz or 81 Hz. The spatial noise pattern consisted of 256 discrete intensity 
values, one per spatial unit. Every 19 ms (or 12 ms at 81 Hz), the pattern shifted, or 
jumped, A spatial units along the axis of the neuron's preferred direction, where A, 
the jump size, was chosen according to a Gaussian, binary, or uniform probability 
distribution. The maximum spatial frequency in the pattern was limited to prevent 
aliasing. 
In the first type of experiment, 10 trials of a 30 s noise sequence, s(t), and 10 trials of 
its reverse, -s(t), were interleaved. A standard GWN spatial pattern and velocity 
modulation pattern were used for all cells, but for each cell, the stimulus was scaled 
for the receptive field size and aligned to the axis of preferred motion. Nine cells 
were tested with Gaussian noise at 81 Hz, 15 cells with binary noise at 81 Hz and 
54 Hz, and 10 cells with uniform noise at 54 Hz. 
In another experiment, a sinusoidal spatial pattern (rather than GWN) moved 
according to a binary white-noise velocity signal. Trials were interleaved with all 
combinations of four spatial frequencies at octave intervals and four relative jump 
sizes: 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, and 1/32 of each spatial period. Typically 10 trials of length 
3 s were run. Four cells were tested at 54 Hz and seven at 81 Hz. 
3 ANALYSIS AND MODELING METHODS 
We used the linear reconstruction methods introduced by Bialek et al. (1991) 
and further analyzed by Gabbiani and Koch (1996) to compute an optimal linear 
estimate of the stimulus, s(t), described above, based on the neuronal response, x(t). 
A single neuronal response was defined as the spike train produced by s(t) minus 
the spike train produced by -s(t). This overcomes the neuron's limited dynamic 
range in response to anti-preferred direction motion (Bialek et al., 1991).

The linear filter, h(t), which when convolved with the response yields the minimum 
mean square error estimate, sest, of the stimulus can be described in terms of its 
Fourier transform, 
= 
Rx (v) ' (1) 
where R (v) is the Fourier transform of the cross-correlation r (-) of the stimulus 
and the resulting spike train and Rx(w) is the power spectrum, i.e., the Fourier 
transform of the auto-correlation, of the spike train (for details and references, see 
Bialek et al., 1991; Gabbiani and Koch, 1996). The noise, n(t), is defined as the 
difference between the stimulus and the reconstruction, 
n(t) = 8et(t)- 8(t), 
(2) 
and the SNR is defined as 
SNR() = 
..(), (3) 
where R(w) is the Fourier power spectrum of the stimulus and R..(v) is the 
power spectrum of the noise. If the stimulus amplitude distribution is Gaussian, 
then SNR(v) can be integrated to give a lower bound on the rate of information 
transmission in bits/s (Gabbiani and Koch, 1996). 
The motion energy model consisted of opponent energy sub-units (Adelson and 
Bergen, 1985) implemented with Gabor functions (Heeger, 1987; Grzywacz and 
Yuille, 1990) in two spatial dimensions and time. The spatial frequency of the 
Gabor function was set to match the spatial frequency of the stimulus, and the 
temporal frequency was set to match that induced by a sequence of jumps equal to 
the standard deviation (SD) of the amplitude distribution (which is the jump size in 
the case of a binary distribution). We approximated causality by shifting the output 
forward in time before computing the optimal linear filter. The model operated on 
the same stimulus patterns and noise sequences that were used to generate stimuli 
for the neurons. The time-varying response of the model was broken into two half- 
wave rectified signals which were interpreted as the firing probabilities of two units, 
a neuron and an anti-neuron that preferred the opposite direction of motion. From 
each unit, ten 30 s long spike trains were generated with inhomogeneous Poisson 
statistics. These 20 model spike trains were used to reconstruct the velocity signal 
in the same manner as the MT neuron output. 
4 RESULTS 
Stimulus reconstruction. Optimal linear reconstruction filters, h(t), were com- 
puted for 26 MT neurons from responses to 30 s sequences of white-noise motion. A 
typical h(t), shown in Fig. 1A (large dots), was dominated by a single positive lobe, 
often preceded by a smaller negative lobe. It was thinner than the reverse correla- 
tion r (-) (Fig. 1A, small dots) from which it was derived due to the division by 
the low-pass power spectrum of the spikes (see Eqn. 1). Also, r(-) occasionally 
had a slower, trailing negative lobe but did not have the preceding negative lobe 
of h(t). On average, h(t) peaked at -69 ms (SD 17) and was 33 ms (SD 12) wide 
at half-height. The peak for rsx(') occurred at the same time, but the width was 
41 ms (SD 15), ranging from 30-90 ms. The point of half-rise on the right side of 
the peak was -53 ms (SD 9) for h(t) and -51 ms (SD 9) for rs (-). For all plots,

vertical axes for velocity show normalized stimulus velocity, i.e., stimulus velocity 
was scaled to have unity SD before all computations. 
Fig 1C (dots) shows the SNR for the reconstruction using the h(t) in panel A. For 
8 cells tested with Gaussian velocity noise, the integral of the log of the SNR gives 
a lower bound for information transmission, which was 6.7 bits/s (SD 2.8), with a 
high value of 12.3 bits/s. Most of the information was carried below 10 Hz, and 90% 
of the information was carried below 18.4 Hz (SD 2.1). In Fig. 1D, the failure of the 
reconstruction (dots) to capture higher frequencies in the stimulus (thick line) is 
directly visible. Both h(t) and SNR(w) were similar but on average slightly greater 
in amplitude for tests using binary and uniform distributed noise. Gaussian noise 
has many jumps at or near zero which may induce little or no response.
