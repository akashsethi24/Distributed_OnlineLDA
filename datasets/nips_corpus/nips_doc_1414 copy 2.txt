Abstract 
Nonlinear dimensionality reduction is formulated here as the problem of trying to 
find a Euclidean feature-space embedding of a set of observations that preserves 
as closely as possible their intrinsic metric structure- the distances between points 
on the observation manifold as measured along geodesic paths. Our isometric 
feature mapping procedure, or isomap, is able to reliably recover low-dimensional 
nonlinear structure in realistic perceptual data sets, such as a manifold of face 
images, where conventional global mapping methods find only local minima. 
The recovered map provides a canonical set of globally meaningful features, 
which allows perceptual transformations such as interpolation, extrapolation, and 
analogy - highly nonlinear transformations in the original observation space - to 
be computed with simple linear operations in feature space. 
1 Introduction 
In psychological or computational research on perceptual categorization, it is generally taken 
for granted that the perceiver has a priori access to a representation of stimuli in terms of 
some perceptually meaningful features that can support the relevant classification. However, 
these features will be related to the raw sensory input (e.g. values of retinal activity or image 
pixels) only through a very complex transformation, which must somehow be acquired 
through a combination of evolution, development, and learning. Fig. 1 illustrates the feature- 
discovery problem with an example from visual perception. The set of views of a face from 
all possible viewpoints is an extremely high-dimensional data set when represented as image 
arrays in a computer or on a retina; for example, 32 x 32 pixel grey-scale images can be 
thought of as points in a 1,024-dimensional observation space. The perceptually meaningful 
structure of these images, however, is of much lower dimensionality; all of the images in 
Fig. 1 lie on a two-dimensional manifold parameterized by viewing angle. A perceptual 
system that discovers this manifold structure has learned a model of the appearance of 
this face that will support a wide range of recognition, classification, and imagery tasks 
(some demonstrated in Fig. 1), despite the absence of any prior physical knowledge about 
three-dimensional object geometry, surface texture, or illumination conditions. 
Learning a manifold of perceptual observations is difficult because these observations

usually exhibit significant nonlinear structure. Fig. 2A provides a simplified version of 
this problem. A flat two-dimensional manifold has been nonlinearly embedded in a three- 
dimensional observation space,  and must be unfolded by the learner. For linearly 
embedded manifolds, principal component analysis (PCA) is guaranteed to discover the 
dimensionality of the manifold and produce a compact representation in the form of an 
orthonormal basis. However, PCA is completely insensitive to the higher-order, nonlinear 
structure that characterizes the points in Fig. 2A or the images in Fig. 1. 
Nonlinear dimensionality reduction - the search for intrinsically low-dimensional struc- 
tures embedded nonlinearly in high-dimensional observations - has long been a goal of 
computational learning research. The most familiar nonlinear techniques, such as the 
self-organizing map (SOM; Kohonen, 1988), the generative topographic mapping (GTM; 
Bishon, Svensen, & Williams, 1998), or autoencoder neural networks (DeMers & Cottrell, 
1993), try to generalize PCA by discovering a single global low-dimensional nonlinear 
model of the observations. In contrast, local methods (Bregler & Omohundro, 1995; Hin- 
ton, Revow, & Dayan, 1995) seek a set of low-dimensional models, usually linear and 
hence valid only for a limited range of data. When appropriate, a single global model is

more revealing and useful than a set of local models. However, local linear methods are in 
general far more computationally efficient and reliable than global methods. 
For example, despite the visually obvious structure in Fig. 2A, this manifold was not 
successfuly modeled by either of two popular global mapping algorithms, SOM (Fig. 2B) 
and GTM (Fig. 2C), under a wide range of parameter settings. Both of these algorithms 
try to fit a grid of predefined (usually two-dimensional) topology to the data, using greedy 
optimization techniques that first fit the large-scale (linear) structure of the data, before 
making small-scale (nonlinear) refinements. The coarse structure of such folded data sets 
as Fig. 2A hides their nonlinear structure from greedy optimizers, virtually ensuring that 
top-down mapping algorithms will become trapped in highly suboptimal solutions. 
Rather than trying to force a predefined map onto the data manifold, this paper shows how a 
perceptual system may map a set of observations in a bottom-up fashion, by first learning 
the topological structure of the manifold (as in Fig. 3A) and only then learning a metric map 
of the data (as in Fig. 3C) that respects this topology. The next section describes the goals and 
steps of the mapping procedure, and subsequent sections demonstrate applications to two 
challenging learning tasks: recovering a five-dimensional manifold embedded nonlinearly 
in 50 dimensions, and recovering the manifold of face images depicted in Fig. 1. 
2 Isometric feature mapping 
We assume our data lie on an unknown manifold M embedded in a high-dimensional 
observation space X. Let z � denote the coordinates of the ith observation. We seek a 
mapping f: X  Y from the observation space X to a low-dimensional Euclidean feature 
space Y that preserves as well as possible the intrinsic metric structure of the observations, 
i.e. the distances between observations as measured along geodesic (locally shortest) paths 
of M. The isometric feature mapping, or isomap, procedure presented below generates 
an implicit description of the mapping f, in terms of the corresponding feature points 
t � = f(z �) for sufficiently many observations z �. Explicit parametric descriptions 
1 
of f or f- can be found with standard techniques of function approximation (Poggio & 
Girosi, 1990) that interpolate smoothly between the known corresponding pairs {a(i), t(i) }. 
A Euclidean map of the data's intrinsic geometry has several important properties. First, 
intrinsically similar observations should map to nearby points in feature space, support- 
ing efficient similarity-based classification and informative visualization. Moreover, the 
geodesic paths of the manifold, which are highly nonlinear in the original observation space, 
should map onto straight lines in feature space. Then perceptually natural transformations 
along these paths, such as the interpolation, extrapolation and analogy demonstrated in 
Figs. 1A-C, may be computed by trivial linear operations in feature space.

The isomap procedure consists of three main steps, each of which might be carried out by 
more or less sophisticated techniques. The crux of isomap is finding an efficient way to 
compute the true geodesic distance between observations, given only their Euclidean dis- 
tances in the high-dimensional observation space. Isomap assumes that distance between 
points in observation space is an accurate measure of manifold distance only locally and 
must be integrated over paths on the manifold to obtain global distances. As preparation for 
computing manifold distances, we first construct a discrete representation of the manifold 
in the form of a topology-preserving network (Fig. 3A). Given this network representation, 
we then compute the shortest-path distance between any two points in the network using 
dynamic programming. This polynomial-time computation provides a good approximation 
to the actual manifold distances (Fig. 3B) without having to search over all possible paths in 
the network (let alone the infinitely many paths on the unknown manifold!). Finally, from 
these manifold distances, we construct a global geometry-preserving map of the observa- 
tions in a low-dimensional Euclidean space, using multidimensional scaling (Fig. 3C). The 
implementation of this procedure is detailed below. 
Step 1: Discrete representation of manifold (Fig. 3A). From the input data of n observations 
{z (]), ..., z() }, we randomly select a subset of r points to serve as the nodes {g(0,..., g(,') } of the 
topology-preserving network. We then construct a graph G over these nodes by connecting g(i) and 
g(s) if and only if there exists at least one x (k) whose two closest nodes (in observation space) are g(i) 
and g(J) (Martinetz & Schulten, 1994). The resulting graph for the data i
