Abstract 
We propose a new and efficient technique for incorporating contextual 
information into object classification. Most of the current techniques face 
the problem of exponential computation cost. In this paper, we propose a 
new general framework that incorporates partial context at a linear cost. 
This technique is applied to microscopic urinalysis image recognition, 
resulting in a significant improvement of recognition rate over the context 
free approach. This gain would have been impossible using conventional 
context incorporation techniques. 
1 BACKGROUND: RECOGNITION IN CONTEXT 
There are a number of pattern recognition problem domains where the classification of an 
object should be based on more than simply the appearance of the object itself. In remote 
sensing image classification, where each pixel is part of ground cover, a pixel is more like- 
ly to be a glacier if it is in a mountainous area, than if surrounded by pixels of residential 
areas. In text analysis, one can expect to find certain letters occurring regularly in particu- 
lar arrangement with other letters(qu, ee,est, tion, etc.). The information conveyed by the 
accompanying entities is referred to as contextual information. Human experts apply con- 
textual information in their decision making [2][6]. It makes sense to design techniques and 
algorithms to make computers aggregate and utilize a more complete set of information in 
their decision making the way human experts do. In pattern recognition systems, however,

the primary (and often only) source of information used to identify an object is the set of 
measurements, or features, associated with the object itself. Augmenting this information 
by incorporating context into the classification process can yield significant benefits. 
Consider a set of N objects Ti, i = 1,...N. With each object we associate a 
class label ci that is a member of a label set ft = 
is characterized by a set of measurements xi E R P, 
tor. Many techniques [1][2][4][6] incorporate context 
{1,...,D}. Each object Ti 
which we call a feature vec- 
by conditioning the posterior 
probability of objects' identities on the joint features of all accompanying objects, �e., 
p(Cl, C2,..., CN IX1, � � � , XN), and then maximizing it with respect to c1, c2,..., CN. It can 
be shown that p(ci c2 ... civlxl,.. xiv) cr p(cllXl) ..p(civlxiv) v(c,...,cN) given 
' ' ' '' ' p(Cl)...p(CN) 
certain reasonable assumptions. 
Once the context-free posterior probabilities p(cilxi) are known, e.g. through the 
use of a standard machine learning model such as a neural network, computing 
p(cl,..., civlx,..., xiv) for all possible Cl,..., c/v would entail (2N + 1)D/v multi- 
plications, and finding the maximum has complexity of D iv, which is intractable for large 
N and D. [2] 
Another problem with this formulation is the estimation of the high dimensional joint dis- 
tribution p(cl, � � �, CN), which is ill-posed and data hungry. 
One way of dealing with these problems is to limit context to local regions. With this 
approach, only the pixels in a close neighborhood, or letters immediately adjacent are con- 
sidered [4][6][7]. Such techniques may be ignoring useful information, and will not apply 
to situations where context doesn't have such locality, as in the case of microscopic uri- 
nalysis image recognition. Another way is to simplify the problem using specific domain 
knowledge [1 ], but this is only possible in certain domains. 
These difficulties motivate the efficient incorporation of partial context as a general frame- 
work, formulated in section 2. In section 3, we discuss microscopic urinalysis image recog- 
nition, and address the importance of using context for this application. Also in section 3, 
techniques are proposed to identify relevant context. Empirical results are shown in section 
4, followed by discussions in section 5.

FORMULATION FOR INCORPORATION OF PARTIAL 
CONTEXT 
To avoid the exponential computational cost of using the identities of all accompanying 
objects directly as context, we use partial context, denoted by A. It is called partial be- 
cause it is derived from the class labels, as opposed to consisting of an explicit labelling of 
all objects. The physical definition of A depends on the problem at hand. In our application, 
A represents the presence or absence of certain classes. Then the posterior probability of 
an object Ti having class label ci conditioned on its feature vector and the relevant context 
A is 
p(cilxi, A) = 
p(ci,xi;A) 
p(xilci, A)P(ci; A) 
p(xi;A) p(xi;A) 
We assume that the feature distribution of an object depends only on its own class, i.e., 
p(xilc, A) - p(xlci). This assumption is roughly true for most real world problems. 
Then,

, p(c) 
The context-sensitive posterior probability p(ci Ixi, A) is obtained through the context-free 
posterior probability p(ci [xi) modified by the context ratio p(ci, A). 
The partial-context maximum likelihood decision rule chooses class label i for element i 
such that 
ai = argmaxp(cilxi, A) 
�i 
A systematic approach to identify relevant context A is addressed in section 3.3. 
(!) 
The partial-context approach treats each element in a set individually, but with addi- 
tional information from the context-bearing factor A. Once p(cilxi) are known for all 
i = 1,..., N, and the context A is obtained, to maximize p(ci[xi, A) from D possible 
values that ci can take on and for all i, the total number of multiplications is 2N, and the 
complexity for finding the maximum is ND. Both are linear in N. The density estimation 
part is also trivial since it is very easy to estimate p(c[A). 
3 MICROSCOPIC URINALYSIS 
3.1 INTRODUCTION 
Urine is one of the most complex body fluid specimens: it potentially contains about 60 
meaningful types of elements. Microscopic urinalysis detects the presence of elements that 
often provide early diagnostic information concerning dysfunction, infection, or inflamma- 
tion of the kidneys and urinary tract. Thus this non-invasive technique can be of great value 
in clinical case management. Traditional manual microscopic analysis relies on human op- 
erators who read the samples visually and identify them, and therefore is time-consuming, 
labor-intensive and difficult to standardize. Automated microscopy of all specimens is more 
practical than manual microscopy, because it eliminates variation among different technol- 
ogists. This variation becomes more pronounced when the same technologist examines 
increasing numbers of specimens. Also, it is less labor-intensive and thus less costly than 
manual microscopy. It also provides more consistent and accurate results. An automat- 
ed urinalysis system workstation (The YellowIRIS TM, International Remote Imaging 
Systems, Inc.) has been introduced in numerous clinical laboratories for automated mi- 
croscopy. Urine samples are processed and examined at 100x (low power field) and 400x 
magnifications (high power field) with bright-field illumination. The YellowIRIS TM au- 
tomated system collects video images of formed analytes in a stream of uncentrifuged urine 
passing an optical assembly. Each image has one analyte in it. These images are given to a 
computer algorithm for automatic identification of analytes. 
Context is rich in urinalysis and plays a crucial role in analyte classification. Some com- 
binations of analytes are more likely than others. For instance, the presence of bacteria 
indicates the presence of white blood cells, since bacteria tend to cause infection and thus 
trigger the production of more white blood cells. If amorphous crystals show up, they tend 
to show up in bunches and in all sizes. Therefore, if there are amorphous crystal look-alikes 
in various sizes, it is quite possible that they are amorphous crystals. Squamous epithelial 
cells can appear both flat or rolled up. If squamous epithelial cells in one form are detected,
