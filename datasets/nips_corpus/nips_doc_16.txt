ABSTRACT 
Based on anatomical and physiological data, we have developed a computer simulation of piri- 
form (olfactory) cortex which is capable of reproducing spatial and temporal patterns of actual 
cortical activity under a variety of conditions. Using a simple Hebb-type learning rule in conjunc- 
tion with the cortical dynamics which emerge from the anatomical and physiological organiza- 
tion of the model, the simulations are capable of establishing cortical representations for differ- 
ent input patterns. The basis of these representations lies in the interaction of sparsely distribut- 
ed, highly divergent/convergent interconnections between modeled neurons. We have shown that 
different representations can be stored with minimal interference, and that following learning 
these representations are resistant to input degradation, allowing reconstruction of a representa- 
tion following only a partial presentation of an original training stimulus. Further, we have 
demonstrated that the degree of overlap of cortical representations for different stimuli can 
also be modulated. For instance similar input patterns can be induced to generate distinct cortical 
representations (discrimination), while dissimilar inputs can be induced to generate overlapping 
representations (accommodation). Both features are presumably important in classifying olfacto- 
ry stimuli. 
INTRODUCTION 
Piriform cortex is a primary olfactory cerebral cortical structure which receives 
second order input from the olfactory receptors via the olfactory bulb (Fig. 1). It 
is believed to play a significant role in the classification and storage of olfactory 
information L2,3. For several years we have been using computer simulations as a 
tool for studying information processing within this cortex 4,5. While we are ulti- 
mately interested in higher order functional questions, our first modeling objective 
was to construct a computer simulation which contained sufficient neurobiological 
detail to reproduce experimentally obtained cortical activity patterns. We believe 
this first step is crucial both to establish correspondences between the model and 
the cortex, and to assure that the model is capable of generating output that can 
be compared to data from actual physiological experiments. In the current case, 
having demonstrated that the behavior of the simulation at least approximates 
that of the actual cortex n (Fig. 3), we are now using the model to explore the 
types of processing which could be carded out by this cortical structure. In partic- 
ular, in this paper we will describe the ability of the simulated cortex to store and 
recall cortical activity patterns generated by stimulus various conditions. We 
believe this approach can be used to provide experimentally testable hypotheses 
concerning the functional organization of this cortex which would have been diffi- 
cult to deduce solely from neurophysiological or neuroanatomical data.

MODEL DESCRIPTION 
This model is largely instructed by the neurobiology of piriform cortex 3. Axon- 
al conduction velocities, time delays, and the general properties of neuronal inte- 
gration and the major intrinsic neuronal connections approximate those currently 
described in the actual cortex. However, the simulation reduces both the number 
and complexity of the simulated neurons (see below). As additional information 
concerning the these or other important features of the cortex is obtained it will be 
incorporated in the model. Bracketed numbers in the text refer to the relevent 
mathematical expressions found in the appendix. 
Neurons. The model contains three distinct populations of intrinsic cortical 
neurons, and a fourth set of cells which simulate cortical input from the olfactory 
bulb (Fig. 2). The intrinsic neurons consist of an excitatory population of pyrami- 
dal neurons (which are the principle neuronal type in this cortex), and two popula- 
tions of inhibitory intemeurons. In these simulations each population is modeled 
as 100 neurons arranged in a 10x10 array (the actual piriform cortex of the rat 
contains on the order of 10 6 neurons). The output of each modeled cell type con- 
sists of an all-or-none action potential which is generated when the membrane 
potential of the cell crosses a threshold [2.3]. This output reaches other neurons 
after a delay which is a function of the velocity of the fiber which connects them 
and the cortical distance from the originating neuron to each target neuron [2.0, 
2.4]. When an action potential arrives at a destination cell it triggers a conduc- 
tance change in a particular ionic channel type in that cell which has a characteris- 
tic time course, amplitude, and waveform [2.0, 2.1]. The effect of this conductance 
change on the transmembrane potential is to drive it towards the equilibrium 
potential of that channel. Na +, CI-, and K + channels are included in the model. 
These channels are differentially activated by activity in synapses associated with 
different cell types (see below).

Connection Patterns. In the olfactory system, olfactory receptors project to the 
olfactory bulb which, in turn, projects directly to the piriform cortex and other olfac- 
tory structures (Fig. 1). The input to the piriform cortex from the olfactory bulb is 
delivered via a fiber bundle known as the lateral olfactory tract (LOT). This fiber 
tract appears to make sparse, non-topographic, excitatory connections with pyra- 
midal and feedforward inhibitory neurons across the extent of the cortex 3,6. In the 
model this input is simulated as 100 independent cells each of which make ran- 
dom connections (p--0.05) with pyramidal and feedforward inhibitory neurons 
(Fig. 1 and 2). 
In addition to the input connections from the olfactory bulb, there is also an 
extensive set of connections between the neurons intrinsic to the cortex (Fig. 2). 
For example, the association fiber system arises from pyramidal cells and makes 
sparse, distributed excitatory connections with other pyramidal cells all across the 
cortex 7'8'9 . In the model these connections are randomly distributed with 0.05 
probability. In the model and in the actual cortex, pyramidal cells also make exci- 
tatory connections with nearby feedforward and feedback inhibitory cells. These 
intemeurons, in turn, make reciprocal inhibitory connections with the group of 
nearby pyramidal cells. The primary effect of the feedback inhibitory neurons is to 
inhibit pyramidal cell firing through a C1- mediated current shunting mecha- 
nism ]�,1],12. Feedforward interneurons inhibit pyramidal cells via a long latency, 
long duration, K + mediated hyperpolarizing potential 12.13. Pyramidal cell axons 
also constitute the primary output of both the model and the actual piriform cor-

$ynaptic Properties and Modification Rules. In the model, each synaptic con- 
nex:tion has an associated weight which determines the peak amplitude of the con- 
ductance change induced in the postsynaptic cell following presynaptic activity 
[2.0]. To study learning in the model, synaptic weights associated with some of 
the fiber systems are modifiable in an activity-dependent fashion (Fig. 2). The 
basic modification rule in each case is Hebb-like; i.e. change in synaptic strength 
is proportional to presynaptic activity multiplied by the offset of the postsynapfic 
membrane potential from a baseline potential. This baseline potential is set 
slightly more positive than the CI' equilibrium potential associated with the shunt- 
ing feedback inhibition. This means that synapses activated while a destination 
cell is in a depolarized or excited state are strengthened, while those activated 
during a period of inhibition are weakened. In the model, synapses which follow 
this rule include the association fiber connections between excitatory pyramidal 
neurons as well as the connections between inhibitory neurons and pyramidal neu- 
rons. Whether these synapses are modifiable in this way in the actual cortex is a 
subject of active research in our lab. However, the model does mimic the actual 
synaptic properties associated with the input pathway (LOT) which we have 
shown to undergo a transient increase in synaptic strength following activation 
which is independent of postsynapfic potential 15. This increase is not permanent 
and the synaptic strength subsequently returns to its baseline value. 
Generation of Physiological Responses. Neurons in the model are represented 
as first-order leaky integrators with multiple, time-varying inputs [1.0]. During 
simulation runs, membrane potentials and currents as well as the time of 
occurence of action potentials are stored for comparison with actual data. An 
explicit compartmental model (5 compartments) of the pyramidal cells is used to 
generate the spatial current distributions used for calculation of field potentials 
(evoked potentials, EEGs) [3.0, 4.0]. 
Stimulus Characteristics. To compare the responses of the model to those of 
the actual cortex, we mimicked actu
