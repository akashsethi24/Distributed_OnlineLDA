Abstract 
A system for color correction has been designed, built, and tested suc- 
cessfully; the essential components are three custom chips built using sub- 
threshold analog CMOS VLSI. The system, based on Land's Retinex the- 
ory of color constancy, produces colors similar in many respects to those 
produced by the visual system. Resistive grids implemented in analog 
VLSI perform the smoothing operation central to the algorithm at video 
rates. With the electronic system, the strengths and weaknesses of the 
algorithm are explored. 
1 A MODEL FOR COLOR CONSTANCY 
Humans have the remarkable ability to perceive object colors as roughly constant 
even if the color of the illumination is varied widely. Edwin Land, founder of the 
Polaroid Corporation, models the computation that results in this ability as three 
identical center-surround operations performed independently in three color planes, 
such as red, green, and blue (Land, 1986). The basis for this model is as follows. 
Consider first an array of grey papers with different reflectances. (Land designated 
these arrays Mondrians, since they resemble the works of the Dutch painter Piet

Mondrian.) Land illuminated a Mondrian with a gradient of illumination, ten times 
more bright at the top than at the bottom, so that the flux reaching the eye from a 
dark grey patch at top was identical to the flux from a light grey patch at bottom. 
Subjects reported that the top paper was dark grey and the bottom paper was 
light grey. Land accounted for this with a center minus surround model. At each 
point in an image, the incoming light is compared to a spatial average of light in 
the neighborhood of the point in question. Near the top of the Mondrian, the 
abundance of white is sensed and subtracted from the central sensor to normalize 
the central reading with respect to neighboring values, weighted with distance; 
near the bottom, the abundance of dark is sensed and used to correct the central 
reading. Land proposed that the weighting function of the surround is a monotonic 
decreasing function of distance, such as 1/r 2. 
In earlier work, similar experiments were carried out with color Mondrians (Land, 
1977; McCann el. al., 1976). However, instead of varying the intensity of illumi- 
nation, Land and his colleagues varied the color of the illumination. The color of 
patches in a Mondrian remained nearly constant despite large changes in the illu- 
minant color. This is the phenomenon of color constancy: the ability of observers 
to judge, under a wide variety of lighting conditions, the approximate reflectance 
or intrinsic color of objects. Land and his colleagues proposed a variety of different 
models for this phenomenon, collectively referred to as Relinec models. (The term 
Retinex was coined by Land since he was not sure whether the computation was 
going on in the retina, the cortex, or both.) In his most recent paper on the subject 
(Land, 1986), Land simply extended the black-and-white model to the three color 
dimensions. In each of three independent color planes, the color at a given point is 
compared to that of the points surrounding it, weighted as 1Iv 2. 
2 EFFICIENT CALCULATION OF THE SURROUND 
In practical terms, the Retinex algorithm corresponds to subtracting from an image 
a blurred version of itself. The distance weighting (type of blurring) Land proposes 
varies as 1/r 2, so the operation is a center minus surround operation, where the 
surround is the center convolved with a 1/r 2 kernel.

where li is the signal or lightness in color plane i, and l is the log of the signal. The 
logs are important since the signal is composed of illuminant times reflectance and 
the log of a product is a sum. By subtracting the blurred version of the image after 
taking logs, the illuminant is subtracted away in the ideal case (but see below). 
This type of Retinex algorithm, then, has a psychophysical basis and sound compu- 
tational underpinnings (Hurlbert, 1986). But the complexity is too great. Since the 
required surround is so large, such a convolution across an NxN pixel image entails 
on the order of N 4 operations. On a chip, this corresponds to explicit connections 
from each pixel to most if not all other pixels. 
A similar operation can be carried out much more efficiently by switching from

a convolution to a resistive grid calculation. The operations are similar since the 
weighting of neighboring points (Green's function) in a resistive grid decreases in 
the limit as the exponential of the distance from a given location on a resistive grid 
(Mead, 1989). Again, the kernel is a monotonic decreasing function. With this type 
of kernel, the operation in each Retinex (color channel) is

where A is the length constant or extent of weighting in the grid. Since the calcula- 
tion is purely local, the complexity is reduced dramatically from O(N 4) to O(N2). 
On a chip, a local computation corresponds to connections only between nearest- 
neighbor pixels.

EVALUATION OF THE ALGORITHM WITH 
COMPUTER SIMULATIONS 
3.1 STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF THE ALGORITHM 
Images of a subject holding a color poster were captured under fluorescent and 
incandescent light with an RGB video camera and a 24 bit frame grabber. First, 
the camera was adjusted so that the color looked good under fluorescent light. Next, 
without readjusting the camera, the fiuorescents were turned off and the subject was 
illuminated with incandescent light. The results were unacceptable. The skin color 
was very red, and, since the incandescent lamp was not very bright, the background 
was lost in darkness. The two images were processed with the Land algorithm, using 
resistive grids to form the surround for subtraction. Details of the simulations and 
color images can be found in (Moore et. al, 1991). For the good, fluorescent image, 
the processing improved the image contrast somewhat. For the poor, incandescent 
image, the improvement was striking. Skin color was nearly normal, shadows were 
softened, and the the background was pulled out of darkness. 
Computer simulation also pointed out two weaknesses of the algorithm: color Mach 
bands and the greying out of large monochromatic regions. Color Mach bands 
arise from this algorithm in the following way. Suppose that a strongly colored 
region, e.g. red, abuts a grey region. In the grey region, the surround subtracted 
at a given point has a strong red component. Therefore, after subtraction of the 
surround, a grey point is rendered as grey minus red, or equivalently, grey plus 
the complementary color of red, which is blue-green. Since the surround weighting 
decreases with distance, the points in the image closest to the red area are strongly 
tinged with blue-green, while points further away are less discolored. Induction of 
this sort in black-and-white images is known as the Mach band effect. An analogous 
induction effect in color is intrinsic to this algorithm. 
Greying out of large colored areas is also an intrinsic weakness of the algorithm. 
The surrounds used in the simulations are quite large, with a length constant of 
nearly one third of the image. Often a large portion of an image is of a single color, 
e.g. a blue sky commonly fills the upper half of many natural scenes. In the sky 
region, the surround samples mostly blue, and with subtraction, blue is subtracted 
from blue, leaving a grey sky. This effect illustrates the essence of the algorithm

- it operates under a grey worm assumption. The image for which this algorithm 
is ideal is richly colored, with reds and their green complements, yellows and their 
blue complements, and whites with their black complements. In such images, the 
large surround is sampling the color of a grey mirror, since the sum of a color 
and its complement is grey. If this condition holds, the color subtracted when the 
surround is subtracted from a point in the image is the color of the illuminant; 
the surround acts as a dull grey mirror which reflects the illuminant. [Many color 
constancy schemes rely on this assumption; for a review see (Lennie and D'Zmura, 
X988).] 
3.2 AN EXTENSION TO THE LAND ALGORITHM 
These two weaknesses arise from too much surround subtraction in solidly colored 
areas. One way the minimize the effects is to modulate the surround with a measure 
of image structure, which we call edginess, before subtraction. So, while for the 
original algorithm, the operation is output = center- surround , to ameliorate 
induction effects and lessen reliance on the grey world assumption, the surround 
weight should be modified pointwise. In particular, if edginess is given a value 
close to zero in homogeneous regions like the blue sky, and is given a value close 
to one in detailed areas, a better formulation is output = center - surround. 
edginess. In this relation, the surround is effectively zeroed in smooth areas before 
it is subtracted, so that induction is diminished - more of the original color is 
retained. The extended algorithm, then, is a working compromise between color 
constancy via strict application of the grey world assumption and no color constancy 
at all. To compute a measure of spatial structur
