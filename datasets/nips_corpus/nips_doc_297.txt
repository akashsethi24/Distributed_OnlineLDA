Abstract 
This paper presents a neural network (NN) approach to the problem of 
stereopsis. The correspondence problem (finding the correct matches 
between the pixels of the epipolar lines of the stereo pair from amongst all 
the possible matches) is posed as a non-iterative many-to-one mapping. A 
two-layer feed forward NN architecture is developed to learn and code this 
nonlinear and complex mapping using the back-propagation learning rule 
and a training set. The important aspect of this technique is that none of 
the typical constraints such as uniqueness and continuity are explicitly 
imposed. All the applicable constraints are learned and internally coded 
by the INN enabling it to be more flexible and more accurate than the 
existing methods. The approach is successfully tested on several random- 
dot stereograms. It is shown that the net can generalize its learned map- 
ping to cases outside its training set. Advantages over the Marr-Poggio 
Algorithm are discussed and it is shown that the INN performance is supe- 
rior. 
I INTRODUCTION 
Three-dimensional image processing is an indispensable property for any advanced 
computer vision system. Depth perception is an integral part of 3-d processing. It 
involves computation of the relative distances of the points seen in the 2-d images 
to the imaging device. There are several methods to obtain depth information. A 
common technique is stereo imaging. It uses two cameras displaced by a known 
distance to generate two images of the same scene taken from these two different 
viewpoints. Distances to objccts can be computed if corresponding points are 
identified in both frames. Corresponding points are two image points which 
correspond to the same object point in the 3-d space as seen by the left and the 
right cameras, respectively. Thus, solving the so called correspondence problem 
327

is the essential stage of depth perception by stereo imaging. 
Many computational approaches to the correspondence problem have been studied 
in the past. An exhaustive review of such techniques is best left to a survey arti- 
cles by Dhond and Aggarwal (1989). Common to all such techniques is the 
employment of some constraints to limit computational requirement and also 
reduce the ambiguity. They usually consist of strict rules that are fixed a priori 
and are based on a rough model of the surface to-be-solved. Unfortunately, 
psychophysical evidence of human stereopsis suggest that the appropriate con- 
straints are more complex and more flexible to be characterized by simple fixed 
rules. 
In this paper, we suggest a novel approach to the stereo correspondence problem 
via neural networks (NN). The problem is cast into a mapping framework and 
subsequently solved by a NN which is especially suited to such tasks. An impor- 
tant aspect of this approach is that the appropriate constraints are automatically 
learned and generalized by the net resulting in a flexible and more accurate model. 
The iterative algorithm developed by Marr and Poggio (1976) for can be regarded 
as a crude neural network approach with no embedded learning. In fact, the ini- 
tial stages of the proposed technique follow the same initial steps taken in that 
algorithm. However, the later stages of the two algorithms are quite distinct with 
ours involving a learning process and non-iterative operation. 
There have been other recent attempts to solve the correspondence problem by 
neural networks. Among these are O'Toole (1989), Qian and Sejnowski (1988), 
Sun et al. (1987), and Zhou and Chellappa (1988). These studies use different 
approaches and topologies from the one used in this paper. 
2 DESCRIPTION OF THE APPROACH 
The proposed approach poses the correspondence problem as a mapping problem 
and uses a special kind of NN to learn this mapping. The only constraint that is 
explicitly imposed is the epipolar constraint. It states that the match of a point 
in row m of one of the two images can only be located in row m of the other 
image. This helps to reduce the computation by restricting the search area. 
2.1 CORRESPONDENCE PROBLEM AS A MAPPING PROBLEM 
The initial phase of the procedure involves casting the correspondence problem as 
a many to one mapping problem. To explain the method, let us consider a very 
simple problem involving one row (epipolar line) of a stereo pair. Assume 6 pixel 
wide rows and take the specific example of [001110] and [111010] as left and right 
image rows respectively. The task is to find the best possible match between these 
two strings which in this case is [1110]. 
The process starts by forming an initial match matrix. This matrix includes all 
possible matches between the pixels of the two rows. Fig. I illustrates this matrix 
for the considered example. Each I indicates a potential match. However only a 
few of these matches are correct. Thus, the main task is to distinguish the correct 
matches which are starred from the false ones. 
Stereopsis by a Neural Network Which Learns the Constraints 329 
To distinguish the correct matches from the false ones, Marr and Poggio (1976) 
imposed two constraints on the correspondences; (1) uniqueness- that there should 
be a one-tx>-one correspondence between features in the two eyes, and (2) smooth- 
ness - that surfaces should change smoothly in depth. The first constraint means 
that only one element of the match matrix may have a value of I along each hor- 
izontal and vertical direction. The second constraint translates into a tendency 
for the correct matches to spread along the 45 � directions. These constraints are 
implemented through weighted connections between match matrix elements. The 
uniqueness constraint is modeled by inhibitory (negative) weights along the 
horizontal/vertical directions. The smoothness constraint gives rise to excitatory 
(positive) weights along 45 � lines. The connections from the rest of elements 
receive a zero (don't care) weight. Using fixed excitatory and inhibitory constants, 
they progressively eliminate false correspondences by applying an iterative algo- 
rithm. 
The described row wise matching does not consider the vertical dependency of pix- 
els in 2-d images. To account for inter-row relationships, the procedure is 
extended by stacking up the initial match matrices of all the rows to generate a 
three-dimensional initial match volume, as shown in Fig. 2. Application of the 
two mentioned constraints extends the 2-d excitatory region described above to a 
45 � oriented plane in the volume while the inhibitory region remains on the 2-d 
plane of the row-wise match. Since depth changes usually happen within a local- 
ity, instead of using the complete planes, a subregion of them around each element 
is selected. Fig. 3 shows an example of such a neighborhood. Note that the con- 
sidered excitatry region is a circular disc portion of the 45 � plane. The choice of 
the radius size (three in this case) is arbitrary and can be varied. A similar itera- 
tive technique is applied to the elemen of the initial match volume in order to 
eliminate incompatible matches and retain the good ones. 
There are several serious difficulties with the Marr-Poggio algorithm. First, there 
is no systematic method for selection of the best values of the 
excitatory/inhibitory weights. These parameters are usually selected by trial and 
error. Moreover, a set of weights that works well for one case does not necessarily 
yield good resul for a different pair of images. In addition, utilization of con- 
stant weights has no analogy in biological vision systems. Another drawback 
regards the imposition of the two previously mentioned constraints which are 
based on assumptions about the form of the underlying scene. However, psycho- 
physical evidence suggests that the stereopsis constraints are more complex and 
more flexible than can be characterized by simple fixed rules. 
The view that we take is that the described process can be posed as a mapping 
operation from the space of initial match volume to the space of true match 
volume. Such a transformation can be considered as a one-shot (non-iterative) 
mapping from the initial matches to the final ones. This is a complex non-linear 
relationship which is very difficult to model by conventional methods. However, a 
neural net can learn, and more importantly generalize it.

The described mapping is a function of the elements in the initial match volume. 
This can be expressed as:

state of the node located at coordinate (a, b, c) in the ini- 
tial match volume. 
A set of three-dimensional coordinates including (xl, x9., xs) 
and those of its neighbors in a specified neighborhood. 
In such a formulation, if f is known, the task is complete. ANN is capable of 
learning f through examining a set of examples involving initial matches and their 
corresponding true matches. The learned function will be coded in a distributive 
manner as the learned weights of the net. 
Note that this approach does not impose any constraints on the solution. No a 
priori excitatory/inhibitory assignments are made. Only a unified concept of a 
neighboring region, S, which influences the disparity computation is adopted. The 
influence of the elements in S on the solution is learned by the NN. This means 
that all the appropriate constraints are automatically learned. 
Unlike the Marr-Poggio approach, the NN formulation allows us to consider any 
shape or size for
