Abstract 
We have designed, fabricated, and tested an adaptive Winner- 
Take-All (WTA) circuit based upon the classic WTA of Lazzaro, 
et al [1]. We have added a time dimension (adaptation) to this 
circuit to make the input derivative an important factor in winner 
selection. To accomplish this, we have modified the classic WTA 
circuit by adding floating gate transistors which slowly null their 
inputs over time. We present a simplified analysis and experimen- 
tal data of this adaptive WTA fabricated in a standard CMOS 2um 
process. 
I Winner-Take-All Circuits 
In a WTA network, each cell has one input and one output. For any set of inputs, the 
outputs will all be at zero except for the one which is from the cell with the maximum 
input. One way to accomplish this is by a global nonlinear inhibition coupled with a 
self-excitation term [2]. Each cell inhibits all others while exciting itself; thus a cell 
with even a slightly greater input than the others will excite itself up to its maximal 
state and inhibit the others down to their minimal states. The WTA function is 
important for many classical neural nets that involve competitive learning, vector 
quantization and feature mapping. The classic WTA network characterized by 
Lazzaro et. al. [1] is an elegant, simple circuit that shares just one common line 
among all cells of the network to propagate the inhibition. 
Our motivation to add adaptation comes from the idea of saliency maps. Picture 
a saliency map as a large number of cells each of which encodes an analog value

reflecting some measure of the importance (saliency) of its input. We would like 
to pay attention to the most salient cell, so we employ a WTA function to tell us 
where to look. But if the input doesn't change, we never look away from that one 
cell. We would like to introduce some concept of fatigue and refraction to each cell 
such that after winning for some time, it tires, allowing other cells to win, and then 
it must wait some time before it can win again. We call this circuit an adaptive 
WTA. 
In this paper, we present an adaptive WTA based upon the classic WTA; Figure 1 
shows a two-input, adaptive WTA circuit. The difference between the classic and 
adaptive WTA is that M4 and M5 are pFET single transistor synapses. A single 
transistor synapse [3] is either an nFET or pFET transistor with a floating gate and 
a tunneling junction. This enhancement results in the ability of each transistor to 
adapt to its input bias current. The adaptation is a result of the electron tunneling 
and hot-electron injection modifying the charge on the floating gate; equilibrium is 
established when the tunneling current equals the injection current. The circuit is 
devised in such a way that these are negative feedback mechanisms, consequently 
the output voltage will always return to the same steady state voltage determined 
by its bias current regardless of the DC input level. Like the autozeroing amplifier 
[4], the adaptive WTA is an example of a circuit where the adaptation occurs as a 
natural part of the circuit operation. 
2 pFET hot-electron injection and electron tunneling 
Before considering the behavior of the adaptive WTA, we will review the processes of 
electron tunneling and hot-electron injection in pFETs. In subthreshold operation, 
we can describe the channel current of a pFET (Ip) for a differential change in gate 
( 
voltage, AV9, around a fixed bias current Iso, as Ip = Iso exp - u, ] where np is 
the amount by which AV 9 affects the surface potential of the pFET, and UT is kT 
q 
We will assume for this paper that all transistors are identical. 
First, we consider electron tunneling. We start with the classic model of electron

tunneling through a silicon - SiOn. system [5]. As in the autozeroing amplifier [4], 
the tunneling current will be only a weak function for the voltage swing on the 
floating gate voltage through the region of subthreshold currents; therefore we will 
approximate the tunneling junction as a current source supplying Itu,o current to 
the floating gate. 
Second, we derive a simple model of pFET hot-electron injection. Figure 2a shows 
the band diagram of a pFET operating at bias conditions which are favorable for 
hot-electron injection. Hot-hole impact ionization creates electrons at the drain edge 
of the depletion region. These secondary electrons travel back into the channel 
region gaining energy as they go. When their energy exceeds that of the SiO2 
barrier, they can be injected through the oxide to the floating gate. The hole 
impact ionization current is proportional to the source current, and is an exponential 
function of the voltage drop from channel to drain (dc). The injection current is 
proportional to the hole impact ionization current and is an exponential function 
of the voltage drop from channel to drain. We will neglect the dependence of the 
floating-gate voltage for a given source current and dc as we did in [4]. Figure 
2b shows measured injection efficiency for several source currents, where injection 
efficiency is the ratio of the injection current to source current. The injection 
efficiency is independent of source current and is approximately linear over a 1 
- 2V swing in ac; therefore we model the injection efficiency as proportional to 
d ) within that I to 2V swing, where V/nj is a measured device parameter 
exp - �,j 
which for our process is 250mV at a bias ac - 8.2V, and Aac is the change in 
ac from the bias level. An increasing voltage input will increase the pFET surface 
potential by capacitive coupling to the floating gate. Increasing the pFET surface 
potential will increase the source current thereby decreasing a� for a fixed output 
voltage and lowering the injection efficiency.

initial input voltage change due to the input step is much smaller than the voltage change 
due to the adaptation. (b) Adaptation time of a losing input voltage for several tunneling 
voltages. The adaptation time is the time from the start of the input current step to the 
time the input voltage is within 10% of its steady state voltage. A larger tunneling current 
decreases the adaptation time by increasing the tunneling current supplied to the floating 
gate. 
3 Two input Adaptive WTA 
We will outline the general procedure to derive the general equations to describe 
the two input WTA shown in Fig. 1. We first observe that transistors Mx, 
and Ma make up a differential pair. Regardless of any adaptation, the middle V 
node and output currents are set by the input voltages (V1 and V2), which are set 
by the input currents, as in the classic WTA [1]. The dynamics for high frequency 
operation are also similar to the classic WTA circuit. Next, we can write the two 
Kirchhoff Current Law (KCL) equations at V1 and V2, which relate the change in 
V and V2 as a function of the two input currents and the floating gate voltages. 
Finally, we can write the two KCL equations at the two floating gates Vfg and 
Vfg2, which relates the changes in the floating gate voltages in terms of V and V2. 
This procedure is directly extendable to multiple inputs. A full analysis of these 
equations is very difficult and will be described in another paper. 
For this discussion, we present a simplified analysis to develop the intuition of the 
circuit operation. At sufficiently high frequencies, the tunneling and injection cur- 
rents do not adapt the floating gate voltages sufficiently fast to keep the input 
voltages at their steady state levels. At these frequencies, the adaptive WTA acts 
like the classic WTA circuit with one small difference. A change in the input volt- 
ages, V or V. is linearly related to V by the capacitive coupling (AV -- -- AV), 
where this relationship is exponential in the classic WTA. There is always some ca- 
pacitance C., even if not explicitly drawn due to the overlap capacitance from the 
floating gate to drain. This property gives the designer the added freedom to mod- 
ify the gain. We will assume the circuit operates in its intended operating regime 
where the floating gate transistors settle sufficiently fast such that their channel
