ABSTRACT 
This paper describes a CMOS artificial neuron. The circuit is 
directly derived from the voltage-gated channel model of neural 
membrane, has low power dissipation, and small layout geometry. 
The principal motivations behind this work include a desire for high 
performance, more accurate neuron emulation, and the need for 
.higher density in practical neural network implementations. 
INTRODUCTION 
Popular neuron models are based upon some statistical measure of known natural 
behavior. Whether that measure is expressed in terms of average firing rate or a 
firing probability, the instantaneous neuron activation is only represented in an 
abstract sense. Artificial electronic neurons derived from these models represent this 
excitation level as a binary code or a continuous voltage at the output of a summing 
amplifier. While such models have been shown to perform well for many applica- 
tions, and form an integral part of much current work, they only partially emulate the 
manner in which natural neural networks operate. They ignore, for example, 
differences in relative arrival times of neighboring action potentials -- an important 
characteristic known to exist in natural auditory and visual networks {Sejnowski, 
1986}. They are also less adaptable to fine-grained, neuron-centered learning, like 
the post-tetanlc facilitation observed in natural neurons. We are investigating the 
implementation and application of neuron circuits which better approximate natural 
neuron function. 
BACKGROUND 
The major temporal artifacts associated with natural neuron function include the 
spacio-temporal integration of synapfic activity, the generation of an action potential 
(AP), and the post-AP hyperpolarization (refractory) period (Figure 1). Integration, 
manifested as a gradual membrane depolarization, occurs when the neuron accumu- 
lates sodium ions which migrate through pores in its cellular membrane. The rate of 
ion migration is related to the level of presynaptic AP bombardment, and is also 
known to be a non-linear function of transmembrane potential. Efferent AP genera- 
tion occurs when the voltage-sensitive membrane of the axosomal hillock reaches 
some threshold potential whereupon a rapid increase in sodium permeability leads to

complete depolarization. Immediately thereafter, sodium pores dose simultaneously 
with increased potassium permeability, thereby repolarizing the membrane toward its 
resting potential. The high potassium permeability during AP generation leads to the 
transient post-AP hyperpolarization state known as the refractory period.

Several analytic and electronic neural models have been proposed which embody 
these characteristics at varying levels of detail. These neuromimes have been used to 
good advantage in studying neuron behavior. However, with the advent of artificial 
neural networks (ANN) for computing, emphasis has switched from modeling neu- 
rons for physiologic studies to developing practical neural network implementations. 
As the desire for high performance ANNs grows, models amenable to hardware 
implementation become more attractive. 
The general idea behind electronic neuromimes is not new. Beginning in 1937 with 
work by Harmon {Harmon, 1937}, lectronic circuits have been used to model and 
study neuronal behavior. In the late 1960's, Lewis {Lewis, 1968} developed a circuit 
which simulated the Hodgkin-Huxley model for a single neuron, followed by 
MacGregor's circuit {MacGregor, 1973} in the early 1970's which modelled a group 
of 50 neurons. With the availability of VLSI in the 1980's, electronic neural imple- 
mentations have largely moved to the realm of integrated circuits. Two different stra- 
tegies have been documented: analog implementations employing operational 
amplifiers {Graf, et al, 1987,1988; Sivilotti, et al, 1986; Raftel, 1988; Schwartz, et al, 
1988}; and digital implementations such as systolic arrays {Kung, 1988}. 
More recently, impulse neural implementations are receiving increased attention. 
Like other models, these neuromimes generate outputs based on some non-linear 
function of the weighted net inputs. However, interneuron communication is realized 
through impulse streams rather than continuous voltages or binary numbers {Murray, 
1988; N. E1-Leithy, 1987}. Impulse networks communicate neuron activation as vari- 
able pulse repetition rates. The impulse neuron circuits which shall be discussed offer 
both small geometry and low power dissipation as well as a closer approximation to 
natural neuron function.

A CMOS IMPULSE NEURON 
An impulse neuron circuit developed for use in CMOS neural networks is shown in 
Figure 2. In thi.q circuit, membrane ion current is modeled by charge flowing to and 
from Ca. Potassium and sodium inflax is represented by current flow from V to the 
capacitor, and ion effiux by flow from the capacitor to ground. The Field Effect- 
Transistors (FETs) connected between V, Vn, and the capacitor emulate voltage- 
and chemically-gated ion channels found in natural neural membrane. In the Figure, 
FET 1 corresponds to the post-synaptic chemically-gated ion channels associated with 
one synapse. FETs 2, 3, and 4 emulate the voltage-gated channels distributed 
throughout a neuron membrane. The following equations summarize circuit opera-

Equation (1) expresses how changes in F'a (which emulates instantancons neuron 
excitation) depend upon the sum of three current components controlled by these 
FETs. E, F, and G in equations (2) through (4) express FET drain-source currents as 
functions terminal voltages. Equations (3) and (:5) rely upon the assumption that FET 
2 and FET 3 arc implcmcntcd as a single dual-gate dcvice where the tra_n.conduc- 
tance/2 =/2/3/(/2 +/3). Non-saturatcd FET opcration is assumcd for thcsc cqua- 
tions cvcn though the FETs will momentarily pass through saturation at the onset of 
conduction in the actual circuit. 
The Schmitt trigger circuit establishes a nonlinear positive feedback path responsible 
for action potcntial initiation. Thc upper thrcshold of thc triggcr (V) cmulatcs thc

FET 3 turns on, crcating a currcnt path from V to Cs, and cmulating thc upswing of 
a natural action potcntial spikc. A momcnt latcr, FET 2 turns off, starting thc action 
potcntial downswing. Simultancously, FET 4 turns on, begining thc absolutc rcfrac- 
tory period whcrc Cs is dischargcd toward thc maximum hyperpolarization potcntial. 
Whcn that potcntial is rcachcd, thc Schmitt triggcr turns off FET 4 and thc impulse

Thc capacitor tcrminal voltagc Va cmulatcs all gross tcmporal artifacts associatcd 
with mcmbranc potcntial, including spacio-tcmporal intcgration, thc action potcntial 
spikc, and a rcfractory period. Thc instantancons nct cxcitation to thc ncuron is 
rcprcscntcd by thc total currcnt flowing into thc summing nodc on thc floating platc 
of thc capacitor. Chargc packcts arc tr_snsfcrrcd from V to the capacitor by thc 
cxcitatory synapse FET. Excitatory packct magnitudc is dcpendcnt upon thc tran- 
sconductance l. Inhibitory synapses (not shown) operatc similarly, but instcad 
rcduce capacitor voltagc by drawing chargc to Vss. A buffcrcd action potential signal 
useful for driving many synapse FETs is availablc at thc gton output.

IMPUIE NEURAL NETWORKS ï¿½ 
Organizing a collection of neuron circuits into a useful network configuration requires 
some weight specification method. Weight values can be either directly specified by 
the designer or learned by the network. A method parlicularly suited for use with the 
fixed FET-synapses of the foregoing circuit is to first learn weights using an off-line  
682 Meador and Cole 
simulation, then translate the numerical results to physical FET transconductances. 
To do this, the activation function of an impulse neuron is derived and used in a 
modified back-propagation learning procedure.
