Abstract 
In 1986, Tanner and Mead [1] implemented an interesting constraint sat- 
isfaction circuit for global motion sensing in aVLSI. We report here a 
new and improved aVLSI implementation that provides smooth optical 
flow as well as global motion in a two dimensional visual field. The com- 
putation of optical flow is an ill-posed problem, which expresses itself as 
the aperture problem. However, the optical flow can be estimated by the 
use of regularization methods, in which additional constraints are intro- 
duced in terms of a global energy functional that must be minimized. We 
show how the algorithmic constraints of Horn and Schunck [2] on com- 
puting smooth optical flow can be mapped onto the physical constraints 
of an equivalent electronic network. 
1 Motivation 
The perception of apparent motion is crucial for navigation. Knowledge of local motion of 
the environment relative to the observer simplifies the calculation of important tasks such as 
time-to-contact or focus-of-expansion. There are several methods to compute optical flow. 
They have the common problem that their computational load is large. This is a severe 
disadvantage for autonomous agents, whose computational power is restricted by energy, 
size and weight. Here we show how the global regularization approach which is necessary 
to solve for the ill-posed nature of computing optical flow, can be formulated as a local 
feedback constraint, and implemented as a physical analog device that is computationally 
efficient.

2 Smooth Optical Flow 
Horn and Schunck [2] defined optical flow in relation to the spatial and temporal changes 
in image brightness. Their model assumes that the total image brightness E(x, y, t) does 
not change over time; 
d 
E(x,y,t) -0. (1) 
Expanding equation (1) according to the chain rule of differentiation leads to 
  ,t) 0, (2) 
E(x,y,t)u + E(x,y,t)v + = 
F- 6x 
where u -- dx/dt and v = dy/dt represent the two components of the local optical flow 
vector. 
Since there is one equation for two unknowns at each spatial location, the problem is 
ill-posed, and there are an infinite number of possible solutions lying on the constraint 
line for every location (x, y). However, by introducing an additional constraint the prob- 
lem can be regularized and a unique solution can be found. 
For example, Horn and Schunck require the optical flow field to be smooth. As a measure 
of smoothness they choose the squares of of the spatial derivatives of the flow vectors, 
= + + k(Sx J + (3) 
One can also view this constraint as introducing a priori knowledge: the closer two points 
are in the image space the more likely they belong to the projection of the same object. Un- 
der the assumption of rigid objects undergoing translational motion, this constraint implies 
that the points have the same, or at least very similar motion vectors. This assumption is 
obviously not valid at boundaries of moving objects, and so this algorithm fails to detect 
motion discontinuities [3]. 
The computation of smooth optical flow can now be formulated as the minimization prob- 
lem of a global energy functional,

with F and S 2 as in equation (2) and (3) respectively. Thus, we exactly apply the approach 
of standard regularization theory [4]:

regularization 
The regularization parameter, A, controls the degree of smoothing of the solution and its 
closeness to the data. The norm, II � II, is quadratic. A difference in our case is that A 
is not constant but depends on the data. However, if we consider motion on a discrete 
time-axis and look at snapshots rather than continuously changing images, A is quasi- 
stationary. 1 The energy functional (4) is convex and so, a simple numerical technique 
like gradient descent would be able to find the global minimum. To compute optical flow 
while preserving motion discontinuities one can modify the energy functional to include 
a binary line process that prevents smoothing over discontinuities [4]. However, such an 
functional will not be convex. Gradient descent methods would probably fail to find the 
global amongst all local minima and other methods have to be applied. 
In the aVLSI implementation this requires a much shorter settling time constant for the network 
than the brightness changes in the image.

3 A Physical Analog Model 
3.1 Continuous space 
Standard regularization problems can be mapped onto electronic networks consisting of 
conductances and capacitors [5]. Hutchinson et al. [6] showed how resistive networks can 
be used to compute optical flow and Poggio et al. [7] introduced electronic network so- 
lutions for second-order-derivative optic flow computation. However, these proposed net- 
work architectures all require complicated and sometimes negative conductances although 
Harris et al. [8] outlined a similar approach as proposed in this paper independently. Fur- 
thermore, such networks were not implemented practically, whereas our implementation 
with constant nearest neighbor conductances is intuitive and straightforward. 
Consider equation (4): 
L = L(u, v, Vu, Vv, x, y). 
The Lagrange function L is sufficiently regular (L  C2), and thus it follows from cal- 
culus of variation that the solution of equation (4) also suffices the linear Euler-Lagrange 
equations 
AV2u-Ex(Exu+Eyv+Et) = 0 (5) 
AV2v- Ey(Exu + Esv + Et) = O. 
The Euler-Lagrange equations are only necessary conditions for equation (4). The suffi- 
cient condition for solutions of equations (5) to be a weak minimum is the strong Legendre- 
condition, that is 
Lvuvu > 0 and Lvvvv > 0, 
which is easily shown to be true. 
3.2 Discrete Space - Mapping to Resistive Network 
By using a discrete five-point approximation of the Laplacian $72 on a regular grid, equa- 
tions (5) can be rewritten as 
/(Ui+i,j q- Ui--l,j q- Ui,j+l q- Ui,j--1 -- 4ui,j) -- Ex,(Ex,,ui,j q- Ey,vi,j + Et,):0 
)t(Vi+l,j q-Vi--l,j q- Vi,j+l q- Vi,j--1 -4vi,) - Ey,,,(E,,jui, + Ey,jvi,j + Et,,j)=O 
where i and j are the indices for the sampling nodes. Consider a single node of the resistive 
network shown in Figure 1:

From Kirchhoff's law it follows that

dt = G(V/+, + V/_, + V/,j+i + V/,-i - 4V/,j) + Ii,, 
(7)

where V/,j represents the voltage and Iim,j 
two neighboring nodes and C the node capacitance. 
In steady state, equation (7) becomes 
G(V/+i,j + V/-1,j q- V/,j+i q- V/,j-1 - 4V/,j) + Iin,,, = O. 
The analogy with equations (6) is obvious: 
G < >

the input current. G is the conductance between

-E,s (E,. ui,j + Ey,,svi,j + Et,,s ) 
-Ey,s (E,,j ui, + Ey,s vi,j + Et,s ) 
(9) 
To create the full system we use two parallel resistive networks in which the node voltages 
Ui,j and V/,j represent the two components of the optical flow vector u and v. The input 
currents Iuim,s and Ivim, are computed by a negative recurrent feedback loop modulated 
by the input data, which are the spatial and temporal intensity gradients. 
Notice that the input currents are proportional to the deviation of the local brightness con- 
straint: the less the local optical flow solution fits the data the higher the current Iim,s will 
be to correct the solution and vice versa. 
Stability and convergence of the network are guaranteed by Maxwell's minimum power 
principle [4, 9].

Figure 2: A single motion cell within the three layer network. For simplicity only one 
resistive network is shown. 
The circuitry consists of three functional layers (Figure 2). The input layer includes an 
array of adaptive photoreceptors [ 10] and provides the derivatives of the image brightness 
to the second layer. The spatial gradients are the first-order linear approximation obtained 
by subtracting the two neighboring photoreceptor outputs. The second layer computes the 
input current to the third layer according to equations (9). Finally these currents are fed 
into the two resistive networks that report the optical flow components. 
The schematics of the core of a single motion cell are drawn in Figure 3. The photoreceptor 
and the temporal differentiator are not shown as well as the other half of the circuitry that 
computes the y-component of the flow vector.

A few remarks are appropriate here: First, the two components of the optical flow vector 
have to be able to take on positive and negative values with respect to some reference po- 
tential. Therefore, a symmetrical circuit scheme is applied where the positive and negative 
(reference voltage) values are carried on separate signal lines. Thus, the actual value is 
encoded as the difference of the two potentials.

Second, the limited linear range of the Gilbert multipliers leads to a narrow span of flow ve- 
locities that can be computed reliably. However, the tuning can be such that the operational 
range is either at high or very low velocities. Newer implementations are using modified 
multipliers with a larger linear rang
