Abstract 
Given a multidimensional data set and a model of its density, 
we consider how to define the optimal interpolation between two 
points. This is done by assigning a cost to each path through space, 
based on two competing goals--one to interpolate through regions 
of high density, the other to minimize arc length. From this path 
functional, we derive the Euler-Lagrange equations for extremal 
motion; given two points, the desired interpolation is found by solv- 
ing a boundary value problem. We show that this interpolation can 
be done efficiently, in high dimensions, for Gaussian, Dirichlet, and 
mixture models. 
I Introduction 
The problem of non-linear interpolation arises frequently in image, speech, and 
signal processing. Consider the following two examples: (i) given two profiles of the 
same face, connect them by a smooth animation of intermediate poses[I]; (ii) given a 
telephone signal masked by intermittent noise, fill in the missing speech. Both these 
examples may be viewed as instances of the same abstract problem. In qualitative 
terms, we can state the problem as follows[2]: given a multidimensional data set, 
and two points from this set, find a smooth adjoining path that is consistent with 
available models of the data. We will refer to this as the problem of model-based 
morphing. 
In this paper, we examine this problem it arises from statistical models of multi- 
dimensional data. Specifically, our focus is on models that have been derived from

some form of density estimation. Though there exists a large body of work on 
the use of statistical models for regression and classification, there has been com- 
paratively little work on the other types of operations that these models support. 
Non-linear morphing is an example of such an operation, one that has important 
applications to video email[3], low-bandwidth teleconferencing[4], and audiovisual 
speech recognition [2]. 
A common way to describe multidimensional data is some form of mixture modeling. 
Mixture models represent the data as a collection of two or more clusters; thus, they 
are well-suited to handling complicated (multimodal) data sets. Roughly speaking, 
for these models the problem of interpolation can be divided into two tasks--how 
to interpolate between points in the same cluster, and how to interpolate between 
points in different clusters. Our paper will therefore be organized along these lines. 
Previous studies of morphing have exploited the properties of radial basis function 
networks[l] and locally linear models[2]. We have been influenced by both these 
works, especially in the abstract formulation of the problem. New features of our 
approach include: the fundamental role played by the density, the treatment of non- 
Gaussian models, the use of a continuous variational principle, and the description 
of the interpolant by a differential equation. 
2 Intracluster interpolation 
Let Q = {q(X), q(2),..., qlQ[) denote a set of multidimensional data points, and let 
P(q) denote a model of the distribution from which these points were generated. 
Given two points, our problem is to find a smooth adjoining path that respects the 
statistical model of the data. In particular, the desired interpolant should not pass 
through regions of space that the modeled density P(q) assigns low probability. 
2.1 Clusters nd metrics 
To develop these ideas further, we begin by considering a special class of models-- 
namely, those that represent clusters. We say that P(q) models a data cluster 
if P(q) has a unique (global) maximum; in turn, we identify the location of this 
maximum, q*, as the prototype. 
Let us now consider the geometry of the space inhabited by the data. To endow this 
space with a geometric structure, we must define a metric, g(q), that provides a 
measure of the distance between two nearby points: 
1 
Z)[q,q+dq]-- Eg(q) dq,dq +O([dq[:). (1) 
Intuitively speaking, the metric should reflect the fact that as one moves away from 
the center of the cluster, the density of the data dies off more quickly in some 
directions than in others. A natural choice for the metric, one that meets the above 
criteria, is the negative Hessian of the log-likelihood: 
(2 
ga/(q) ---- [ln P(q)]. (2)

2.2 From densities to paths 
The problem of model-based interpolation is to balance two competing goals-- 
one to interpolate through regions of high density, the other to avoid excessive 
deformations. Using the metric in eq. (1), we can now assign a cost (or penalty) to 
each path based on these competing goals. 
Consider the path parameterized by q(t). We begin by dividing the path into 
segments, each of which is traversed in some small time interval, dr. We assign a 
value to each segment by 
[ p(q(t)) 1 } )[q(t),q(t+dt)] 
= L ' 
(3) 
where ? _> 0. For reasons that will become clear shortly, we refer to ? as the 
line tension. The value assigned to each segment dep,ens on two terms: a ratio 
of probabilities, P(q(t))/P(q*), which favors points near the prototype, and the 
constant multiplier, e -. Both these terms are upper bounded by unity, and hence 
so is their product. The value of the segment also decays with its length, as a result 
of the exponent, D[q(t), q(t + dt)l. 
We derive a path functional by piecing these segments together, multiplying their 
individual contributions, and taking the continuum limit. A value for the entire 
path is obtained from the product: 
(4) 
Taking the logarithm of both sides, and considering the limit dt - 0, we obtain the 
path functional 
1 
$[q(t)]-/ {-In [P(q(t))] +/} ga(q)OaO 
[ P(q*) 
(5) 
where dl -- [q] is the tangent vector to the path at time t. The terms in this 
functional balance the two competing goals for non-linear interpolation. The first 
favors paths that interpolate through regions of high density, while the second favors 
paths with small arc lengths; both are computed under the metric induced by the 
modeled density. The line tension/? determines the cost per unit arc length and 
modulates the competition between the two terms. Note that the value of the 
functional does not depend on the rate at which the path is traversed. 
To minimize this functional, we use the following result from the 
variations. Let �(q, dl) denote the integrand of eq. (5), such that 
fdt �(q, dl). Then the path which minimizes this functional obeys

We define the model-based interpolant between two points as the path which mini- 
mizes this functional; it is found by solving the associated boundary value problem. 
The function �(q,/1) is known as the Lagrangian. In the next sections, we present 
eq. (5) for two distributions of interest--the multivariate Gaussian and the Dirichlet. 
2.3 Gaussian cloud 
The simplest model of multidimensional data is the multivariate Gaussian. In this 
case, the data is modeled by 
IMIX/2 { 1 [xTMx]} (7) 
P(x)- (ga.)N/2 exp -- , 
where M is the inverse covariance matrix and N is the dimensionality. Without 
loss of generality, wehave chosen the coordinate system so that the mean of the 
data coincides with the origin. For the Gaussian, the mean also defines the location 
of the prototype; moreover, from eq. (2), the metric induced by this model is just 
the inverse covariance matrix. From eq. (5), we obtain the path functional: 
To find a model-bed interpolant, we seek the path that minimizes this hnctional. 
Because the functional is parameterization-invariant, it suffices to consider paths 
that are traversed at a constant (unit) rate: irMi = 1. om eq. (6), we find that 
the optimal path with this parameterization satisfies: 
This is a set of coupled non-linear equations for the components of x(t). However, 
note that at any moment in time, the acceleration, , can be expressed  a linear 
combination of the position, x, and the velocity, . It follows that the motion of x 
lies in a plane; in particular, it lies in the plane spanned by the initial conditions, 
x and , at time t = 0. This enables one to solve the boundary value problem 
efficiently, even in very high dimensions. 
Figure la shows some solutions to this boundary value problem for different values 
of the line tension, t. Note how the paths bend toward the origin, with the degree 
of curvature determined by the line tension, t. 
2.4 Dirichlet simplex 
For many types of data, the multivariate Gaussian distribution is not the most 
appropriate model. Suppose that the data points are vectors of positive numbers 
whose elements sum to one. In particular, we say that w is a probability vector 
ifw = (wx,w2,...,wv) E Tff v, wa > 0 for alla, and awa = 1. Clearly, the 
multivariate Gaussian is not suited to data of this form, since no matter what the 
mean and covariance matrix, it cannot assign zero probability to vectors outside 
the simplex. Instead, a more natural model is the Dirichlet distribution: 
p(w) = r(0)H ' (10) 
A Variational Principle for Model-basedMorphing 271 
where 0a > 0 for all a, and 0 --  0. Here, r(.) is the gamma function, and 
0 are parameters that determine the statistics of P(w). Note that P(w) = 0 for 
vectors that are not probability vectors; in particular, the simplex constraints on w 
are implicit assumptions of the model. 
We can rewrite the Dirichlet distribution in a more revealing form as follows. First, 
let w* denote the probability
