Abstract 
Airline companies usually schedule their flights and crews well in 
advance to optimize their crew pools activities. Many events such 
as flight delays or the absence of a member require the crew pool 
rescheduling team to change the initial schedule (rescheduling). In 
this paper, we show that the neural network comparison paradigm 
applied to the backgammon game by Tesauro (Tesatlro and Se- 
jnowski, 1989) can also be applied to the rescheduling problem of 
an aircrew pool. Indeed both problems correspond to choosing 
the best solution from a set of possible ones without ranking them 
(called here best choice problem). The paper explains from a math- 
ematical point of view the architecture and the learning strategy of 
the backpropagation neural network used for the best choice prob- 
lem. We also show how the learning phase of the network can be 
accelerated. Finally we apply the neural network model to some 
real rescheduling problems for the Belgian Airline (Sabena). 
I Introduction 
Due to merges, reorganizations and the need for cost reduction, airline companies 
need to improve the efficiency of their manpower by optimizing the activities of 
their crew pools as much as possible. A standard scheduling of flights and crews is 
usually made well in advance but many events, such as flight delays or the absence 
of a crew member make many schedule changes (rescheduling) necessary.

Each day, the CPR 1 team of an airline company has to deal with these pertur- 
bations. The probleln is to provide the best answer to these regularly occurring 
perturbations and to limit their impact on the general schedule. Its solution is hard 
to find and usually the CPR team calls on hall reserve crews. An efficient reschedul- 
ing tool taking into account the experiences of the CPR team could substantially 
reduce the costs involved in rescheduling notably by limiting the use of a reserve 
crew. 
The paper is organized as follow. In the second section we describe the rescheduling 
task. In the third section we argue for the use of a neural network for the reschedul- 
ing task and we apply an adequate architecture for such a network. Finally in 
the last section, we present results of experiments with schedules based on actual 
schedtales used by Sabena. 
2 Rescheduling for an Airline Crew Pool 
When a pilot is unavailable for a flight it becomes necessary to replace him, e.g. 
to reschedule the crew. The rescheduling starts froin a list of potential substitute 
pilots (PSP) given by a schedtaling prograan based generally on operation research or 
expert system technology (Steels, 1990). The PSP list obtained respects legislation 
and security rules fixing for example the mareher of flying hours per month, the 
maximum number of consecutive working hour and the number of training hours 
per year and their schedule. From the PSP list, the CPR team selects the best 
candidates taking into account the schedule stability and equity. The schedule 
stability requires that possible perturbations of the schedule can be dealt with with 
only a minimal rescheduling effort. This criterion ensures work stability to the crew 
members and has an important influence on their social behavior. The schedule 
equity ensures the equal distribution of the work and payment among the crew 
members during the schedule period. 
One may think to solve this rescheduling problem in the same way as the scheduling 
problem itself using software tools based on operational research or expert system 
approach. But this is inefficient for two reasons, first, the scheduling issued from a 
scheduling system and its adaptation to obtain an acceptable schedule takes days. 
Second this system does not take into accotint the previous schedule. It follows 
that the lapdated one anay (lifter significantly fi'om the previous one after each 
perturbation. This is unacceptable fa'oan a pilot's point of view. ttence a specific 
procedure for rescheduling is necessary. 
3 Neural Network Approach 
The problem of reassigning a new crew member to replace a missing member can 
be seen as the problem of finding the best pilot in a pool of potential substittate 
pilots (PSP), called the bcst choicc problem. 
To solve the best choice problem, we choose the neural network approach for two 
reasons. First the rules used by the expert are not well defined: to find the best PSP,

the expert associates implicitly a score vahle to each profile. The learning approach 
is precisely well suited to integrate, ill a short period of time, the expert knowledge 
given in an implicit form. Second, the neural network approach was applied with 
success to board-games e.g. the Backgammon game described by Tesauro (Tesanro 
and Sejnowski, 1989) and the Nine Men's Morris game described by Bratin (Braun 
and al., 1991). These two games are also examples of best choice problem where 
the player chooses the best move from a set of possible ones. 
3.1 Profile of a Potential Substitute Pilot 
To be able to use the neural network approach we have to identify the main fea- 
tures of the potential substitute pilot and to codify them in terms of rating values 
(de Gerlache and Keymeulen, 1993). We based our coding scheme on the way the 
expert solves a rescheduling problem. He identifies the relevant parameters associ- 
ated with the PSP and the perturbed schedule. These parameters give three types 
of information. A first type describes the previous, present and furtire occupation 
of the PSP. The second type represents information not in the schedule such as 
the human relationship factors. The associated vaines of these two types of pa- 
rameters differ for each PSP. The last type of pa.rameters describes the context 
of the reschednling, namely the characteristics of the schedule. This last type of 
parameters are the same for all the PSP. All these paranleters form the profile of 
a PSP associated to a perturbed schedule. At each rescheduling problem corre- 
sponds one perturbed schedule j and a group of, PSP i to which we associate a 
Profile _= (PSP i, Perturbed_Schedule j). Implicitly, the expert associates a rat- 
ing value between 0 and 1 to each parameter of the Profi!� based on respectively 
its little or important impact on the resulting schedule if the PSP i was chosen. 
The rating value reflects the relative ilnportance of the parameters on the stability 
and the equity of the resulting schedule obtained after the pilots substitution. 
3.2 Dual Neural Network 
It would have been possible to get more information froill the expert than only the 
best profile. One of the possibilities is to ask him to score every profile associated 
with a perturbed planning. From this association we could immediately construct 
a scoring function which couples each profile with a specific vahle, namely its score. 
Another possibility is to ask the expert to rank all profiles associated with a per- 
turbed schedule. The corresponding ranki,.g function couples each profile with a 
value snch that the vahles associated with the profiles of the same perturbed sched- 
ule order the profiles according to their rank. The decision making process used by 
the rescheduler team for the aircrew rescheduling problem does not consist in the 
evaluation of a scoring or ranking function. Indeed only the knowledge of the best 
profile is useful for the rescheduling process. 
From a neural network architectural point of view, because the ranking problem is a 
generalization of the best choice problem, a same neural network architecture can be 
used. But the difference between the best choice problem and the scoring problem 
is such that two different neural network architectures are associated to them. As 
we show in this section, although a backpropagation network is sufficient to learn a 
scoring function, its architecture, its learning and its retrieval procedures must be 
804 Keyrneulen and de Gerlache 
adapted to learn the best profile. Through a mathematical formulation of the best 
choice problem, we show that the comparison paradigm of Tesauro (Tesauro, 1989) 
is suited to the best choice problem and we suggest how to improve the learning 
convergence. 
3.2.1 Comparing Function 
For the best choice problem the expert gives the best profile Profile .Bet associated 
$ 
with the perturbed schedule j and that for m perturbed schedules. The problem 
consists then to learn the mapping of the m. n profiles associated with the m 
perturbed schedules into the rn best profiles, one for each perturbed schedule. One 
way to represent this association is through a corn, paring function. This function 
has as input a profile, represented by a vector Xj, and returns a single value. When 
a set of profiles associated with a perturbed schedule are evaluated by the function, 
it returns the lowest value for the best profile. This comparing timetlon integrates 
the information given by the expert and is sufficient to reschedule any perturbed 
schedule solved in the past by the expert. Formally it is defined by: 
Co,,pa,'e. = �(Profile) (1) 
Compareff *t <Com. parc. { Vj with j = 1,...,m 
ViBest with i=l,...,n 
The value of Compare are not known a priori and have only a meaning when they 
are compared to the value Compare * of the comparing filnction for the best 
profile. 
3.2.2 Geometrical Interpretation 
To illustrate the difference between the neural network learning of a scoring function 
and a comparing function, we propose a geometrical interpretation in the case of 
a linear network having as inp
