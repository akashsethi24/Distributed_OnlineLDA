Abstract 
We use connectionist modeling to develop an analysis of stress systems in terms 
of ease of learnability. In traditional linguistic analyses, learnability arguments 
determine default parameter settings based on the feasibilty of logically deducing 
correct settings from an initial state. Our approach provides an empirical alter- 
native to such arguments. Based on perceptron learning experiments using data 
from nineteen human languages, we develop a novel characterization of stress 
patterns in terms of six parameters. These provide both a partial description of the 
stress pattern itself and a prediction of its learnability, without invoking abstract 
theoretical constructs such as metrical feet. This work demonstrates that ma- 
chine learning methods can provide a fresh approach to understanding linguistic 
phenomena. 
1 LINGUISTIC STRESS 
The domain of stress systems in language is considered to have a relatively good linguistic 
theory, called metrical phonology . In this theory, the stress patterns of many languages 
can be described concisely, and characterized in terms of a set of linguistic parameters, 
such as bounded vs. unbounded metrical feet, left vs. right dominant feet, etc. 2 In many 
languages, stress tends to be placed on certain kinds of syllables rather than on others; the 
former are termed heavy syllables, and the latter light syllables. Languages that distinguish

between heavy and light syllables are termed quantity-sensitive (QS), while languages that 
do not make this distinction are termed quantity-insensitive (QI). In some QS languages, 
what counts as a heavy syllable is a closed syllable (a syllable that ends in a consonant), 
while in others it is a syllable with a long vowel. We examined the stress patterns of 
nineteen QI and QS systems, summarized and exemplified in Table 1. The data were drawn 
primarily from descriptions in [Hayes 80]. 
2 PERCEPTRON SIMULATIONS 
In separate experiments, we trained a perceptron to produce the stress pattern of each of 
these languages. Two input representations were used. In the syllabic representation, used 
for QI patterns only, a syllable was represented as a [1 1] vector, and [0 0] represented no 
syllable. In the weight-string representation, which was necessary for QS languages, the 
input patterns used were [1 0] for a heavy syllable, [0 1] for a light syllable, and [0 0] for 
no syllable. For stress systems with up to two levels of stress, the output targets used in 
training were 1.0 for primary stress, 0.5 for secondary stress, and 0 for no stress. For stress 
systems with three levels of stress, the output targets were 0.6 for secondary stress, 0.35 for 
tertiary stress, and 1.0 and 0 respectively for primary stress and no stress. The input data set 
for all stress systems consisted of all word-forms of up to seven syllables. With the syllabic 
input representation there are 7 of these, and with the weight-string representation, there are 
255. The perceptron's input array was a buffer of 13 syllables; each word was processed 
one syllable at a time by sliding it through the buffer (see Figure 1). The desired output at 
each step was the stress level of the middle syllable of the buffer. Connection weights were 
adjusted at each step using the back-propagation learning algorithm [Rumelhart 86]. One 
epoch consisted of one presentation of the entire training set. The network was trained for 
as many epochs as necessary to ensure that the stress value produced by the perceptron was 
within 0.1 of the target value, for each syllable of the word, for all words in the training set. 
A learning rate of 0.05 and momentum of 0.90 was used in all simulations. Initial weights 
were uniformly distributed random values in the range -t-0.5. Each simulation was run at 
least three times, and the learning times averaged.

Table 1: Stress patterns: description and example stress assignment. Examples are of 
stress assignment in seven-syllable words. Primary stress is denoted by the superscript 1 
(e.g., S), secondary stress by the superscript 2, tertiary stress by the superscript 3, and no 
stress by the superscript 0. S indicates an arbitrary syllable, and is used for the QI stress 
patterns. For QS stress patterns, H and L are used to denote Heavy and Light syllables, 
respectively.

3 PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS OF LEARNABILITY OF STRESS 
The learning times differ considerably for {Latvian, French}, {Maranungku, Weft}, 
{Lakota, Polish} and Garawa, as shown in the last column of Table 2. Moreover, Paiute 
and Warao were unlearnable with this model. 3 Differences in learning times for the var- 
ious stress patterns suggested that the factors (parameters) listed below are relevant in 
determining learnability. 
1. Inconsistent Primary Stress (IPS): it is computationally expensive to learn the pattern 
if neither edge receives pftmary stress except in mono- and di-syllables; this can be 
regarded as an index of computational complexity that takes the values {0, 1 }: 1 if an 
edge receives pftmary stress inconsistently, and 0, otherwise. 
2. Stress clash avoidance (SCA): if the components of a stress pattern can potentially 
lead to stress clash 4, then the language may either actually permit such stress clash, or 
it may avoid it. This index takes the values {0, 1 }: 0 if stress clash is permitted, and 
1 if stress clash is avoided. 
3. Alternation (A!t): an index of learnability with value 0 if there is no alternation, and 
value 1 if there is. Alternation refers to a stress pattern that repeats on alternate 
syllables. 
4. Multiple Primary Stresses (MPS): has value 0 if there is exactly one pftmary stress, 
and value 1 if there is more then onepftmary stress. It has been assumed that a repeating 
pattern of pftmary stresses will be on alternate, rather than adjacent syllables. Thus, 
[Alternation=O] implies [MPS=0]. Some of the hypothetical stress patterns examined 
below include ones with more than one pftmary stress; however, as far as is known, 
no actually occurring QI stress pattern has more than one pftmary stress. 
5. Multiple Stress Levels (MSL): has value 0 if there is a single level of stress (primary 
stress only), and value 1 otherwise. 
Note that it is possible to order these factors with respect to each other to form a five- 
digit binary string characterizing the ease/difficulty of learning. That is, the computational 
complexity of learning a stress pattern can be characteftzed as a 5-bit binary number whose 
bits represent the five factors above, in decreasing order of significance. Table 2 shows 
that this characteftzation captures the learning times of the QI patterns quite accurately. As 
an example of how to read Table 2, note that Garawa takes longer to learn than Latvian 
(165 vs. 17 epochs). This is reflected in the parameter setting for Garawa, 01101, being 
lexicographically greater than th
