Abstract 
A unique architecture of winner search hardware has been de- 
veloped using a novel neuron-like high functionality device called 
Neuron MOS transistor (or vMOS in short) [1,2] as a key circuit 
element. The circuits developed in this work can find the location 
of the maximum (or minimum) signal among a number of input 
data on the continuous-time basis, thus enabling real-time winner 
tracking as well as fully-parallel sorting of multiple input data. We 
have developed two circuit schemes. One is an ensemble of self- 
loop-selecting vMOS ring oscillators finding the winner as an oscil- 
lating node. The other is an ensemble of yMOS variable threshold 
inverters receiving a common ramp-voltage for competitive excita- 
tion where data sorting is conducted through consecutive winner 
search actions. Test circuits were fabricated by a double-polysilicon 
CMOS process and their operation has been experimentally veri- 
fied. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
Search for the largest (or the smallest) among a number of input data, i.e., the 
winner-take-all (WTA) action, is an essential part of intelligent data processing 
such as data retrieval in associative memories [3], vector quantization circuits [4], 
Kohonen's self-organizing maps [5] etc. In addition to the maximum or minimum 
search, data sorting also plays an essential role in a number of signal processing 
such as median filtering in image processing, evolutionary algorithms in optimizing 
problems [6] and so forth. Usually such data processing is carried out by software 
running on general purpose computers, but the computation time increases explo-

sively with the increase in the volume of data. In order to build electronic systems 
having a real-time-response capability, the direct implementation of fully paxallel 
algorithms on the integrated circuits haxdwaxe is critically demanded. 
A vaxiety of WTA [4, 7, 8] circuits have been implemented so fax based on analog 
current-mode circuit technologies. A number of cells, each composed of a current 
source, competitively shaxe the total current specified by a global current sink and 
the winner is identified through the current concentration towaxd the cell via tacit 
positive feedback mechanisms. The circuit implementations using MOSFET's op- 
erating in the subthreshold regime [4, 7] axe ideal for laxge scale integration due to 
its ultra low power nature. Although they axe inherently slow at circuit levels, the 
performance at a system level is fax superior to digital counterpaxts owing to the 
flexible computing algorithms of analog. In order to achieve a high speed opera- 
tion, MOSFET's biased at strong inversion is also utilized in Ref. [8]. However, 
cost must be traxied off for increased power. 
What we axe presenting in this paper is a unique WTA axchitecture implemented 
by vMOS technology [1,2]. In vMOS circuits the summation of multiples of voltage 
signals is conducted on the cMOS floating gate (or better be called temporaxy float- 
ing gate when used in a clocked scheme [9]) via chaxge shaxing aznong cpacitors, 
and the result of the summation controls the transistor action. The voltage-mode 
summation capability of cMOS has been uniquely utilized to produce the WTA 
action. No DC current flows for the sum operation itself in contrast to the Kirch- 
hoff sum. In cMOS transistors, however, DC current flows in a CMOS inverter 
configuration when the floating gate is biased in the transition region. Therefore 
the power consumption is laxget than in the subthreshold circuitdes. However, the 
cMOS WTA's presented in this axticle will give an opportunity of high speed opera- 
tion at much less power consumption than current-mode circuitties operating in the 
strong inversion mode. In the following we present two kinds of winner seaxch haxd- 
waxe featuring very fast operation. The winner cn be tracked in a continuous-time 
regime with a detection delay time of about 100psec, while the sorting of multiple 
data is conducted in a fixed frazne of time of about 100nsec.

CMOS inverter in which the common gate is made floating and its potential brn 
is determined via capacitance coupling with three input terminals. V (~ 1/4) and 
Vn are equally coupled to the floating gate and a small capacitance pulls down the 
floating gate to ground. The zMOS inverter-B is designed to turn on when the 
number of l's in its inputs (VA ~ VA4) is more than 1. When a feedback loop is 
formed as shown in the figure, it becomes a ring oscillator composed of odd-numbers 
of inverter stages. 
When V ~ V4 = 0, the circuit is stable with Vn = 1 because inverter-A's do not 
turn on. This is because the small grounded capacitor pulls down the floating gate 
potential brn a little smaller than its inverting threshold (Vt>t>/2) (see Fig. l(b)). 
If non-zero signals are given to input terminals, more-than-one inverter-A's turn on 
(see Fig. 1 (c)) and the inverter-B also turns on, thus initiating the transition of Vn 
from VDD to 0. According to the decrease in Vn, some of the inverter-A's turn off 
but the inverter-B (number 1 detector) still stays at on-state until the last inverter- 
A turns off. When the last inverter-A, the one receiving the largest voltage input, 
turns off, the inverter-B also turns off and Vn begins to increase. As a result, ring 
oscillation occurs only in the loop including the largest-input inverter-A(Fig. l(d)). 
In this manner, the winner is identified as an oscillating node. The inverter-B can 
be altered to a number 2 detector or a number 3 detector etc. by just reducing 
the input voltage to the largest coupling capacitor. Then it is possible for top two 
or top three to be winners.

Fig. 2(a) demonstrates the measured wave forms of a bread-board test circuit 
composed of discrete components for verifying the circuit idea. It is clearly seen that 
ring oscillation occurs only at the temporal winner. However, the ring oscillation 
increases the power dissipation, and therefore, non-oscillating circuitry would be 
preferred. An example of simulation results for such a non-oscillating circuit is 
demonstrated in Fig. 2(b).

continuous-time WTA. In order to suppress the oscillation, the loop gain is reduced 
by removing the two-stage CMOS inverters in front of the inverter-B and _rig delay 
element is inserted in the feedback loop. The small grounded capacitors were re- 
moved in inverter-A's. The waveforms demonstrated in Fig. 2(b) axe the HSPICE 
simulation results with R = 0 and C'ExT = 20C'gae(C'gae: input capacitance of 
elemental CMOS inverter=5.16fF) . The circuit was simulated assuming a typical 
double-poly 0.5-#m CMOS process. Fig. 3(b) indicates the combinations of R and 
C'rxr yielding the non-oscillating mode of operation obtained by HSPICE simula- 
tion. It is important to note that if C'x, _ 15C'ot, non-oscillating mode appears 
with R = 0. This means the output resistance of the inverter-B plays the role of 
R. When the number of inverter-A's is increased, the increased capacitance load 
serves as C'rxr. Therefore, WTA having more than 19 input signals can operate in 
the non-oscillating mode. Fig. 3(c) represents the detection delay as a function of 
C'xr. It is known that the increase in C'Exr, therefore the increase in the number 
of input signals to the WTA, does not significantly increase the detection delay and 
that the delay is only in the range of 100 to 200psec.
