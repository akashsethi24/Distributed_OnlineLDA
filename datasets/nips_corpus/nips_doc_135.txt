ABSTRACT 
Currently, the most complex spacecraft attitude determination 
and control tasks are ultimately governed by ground-based 
systems and personnel. Conventional on-board systems face 
severe computational bottlenecks introduced by serial 
microprocessors operating on inherently parallel problems. New 
computer architectures based on the anatomy of the human brain 
seem to promise high speed and fault-tolerant solutions to the 
limitations of serial processing. This paper discusses the latest 
applications of artificial neural networks to the problem of star 
pattern recognition for spacecraft attitude determination. 
INTRODUCTION 
By design, a conventional on-board microprocessor can perform only 
one comparison or calculation at a time. Image or pattern recognition 
problems involving large template sets and high resolution can require 
an astronomical number of comparisons to a given database. Typical 
mission planning and optimization tasks require calculations involving 
a multitude of parameters, where each element has an inherent degree 
of importance, reliability and noise. Even the most advanced 
supercomputers running the latest software can require seconds and 
even minutes to execute a complex pattern recognition or expert system 
task, often providing incorrect or inefficient solutions to problems that 
prove trivial to ground control specialists. 
The intent of ongoing research is to develop a neural network based 
satellite attitude determination system prototype capable of determining 
its current three-axis inertial orientation. Such a system that can 
determine in real-time, which direction the satellite is facing, is needed 
in order to aim antennas, science instruments, and navigational 
equipment. For a satellite to be autonomous (an important criterion in 
interplanetary missions, and most particularly so in the event of a 
system failure), this task must be performed in a reasonable amount of 
time with all due consideration to actual environmental, noise and 
precision constraints. 
CELESTIAL ATTITUDE DETERMINATION 
Under normal operating conditions there is a whole repertoire of 
spacecraft systems that operate in conjunction to perform the attitude 
determination task, the backbone of which is the Gyro. But a Gyro 
measures only changes in orientation. The current attitude is stored in 
Neural Network Star Pattern Recognition 315 
volatile on-board memory and is updated as the gyro system integrates 
velocity to provide change in angular position. When there is a power 
system failure for any reason such as a single-event-upset due to cosmic 
radiation, all currently stored attitude information is LOST! 
One very attractive way of recovering attitude information with no 
a priori knowledge is by using on-board imaging and computer systems 
to: 
1.) Image a portion of the sky, 
2.) 
Compare the characteristic pattern of stars in the sensor field- 
of-view to an on-board star catalog, 
3.) Thereby identify the stars in the sensor FOV [Field Of View], 
4.) Retrieve the identified star coordinates, 
5.) 
Transform and correlate FOV and real-sky coordinates to 
determine spacecraft attitude. 
But the problem of matching a limited field of view that contains a 
small number of stars (out of billions and billions of them), to an on- 
board full-sky catalog containing perhaps thousands of stars has long 
been a severe computational bottleneck.

The latest serial algorithm to perform this task requires 
approximately 650 KBytcs of RAM to store the on-board star catalog. 
It incorporates a highly optimized algorithm which uses a motorola 
68000 to search a sorted database of more than 70,000 star-pair distance 
values for correlations with the decomposed star pattern in the sensor 
FOV. It performs the identification process on the order of I second 
316 Alvelda and San Martin 
with a success rate of 99 percent. But it does not fit in the spacecraft 
on-board memory, and therefore, no such system has flown on a 
planetary spacecraft.

As a result, state-of-the-art interplanetary spacecraft use several 
independent sensor systems in c. onjunction to determine attitude with no 
a priori knowledge. First, the craft is commanded to slew until a Sun 
Sensor (aligned with the spacccraft's major axis) has locked-on to the 
sun. The craft must then rotate around that axis until an appropriate 
star pattern at approximately ninety degrees to the sun is acquired to 
provide three-axis orientation information. The entire attitude 
acquisition sequence requires an absolute minimum of thirty minutes, 
and presupposes that all spacecraft actuator and maneuvering systems 
arc operational. At the phenomenal rendezvous speeds involved in 
interplanetary navigation, a system failure near mission culmination 
could mcan an almost complete loss of the most valuable scientific data 
while the spacecraft performs its initial attitude acquisition sequence. 
NEURAL MOTIVATION 
The parallel architecture and collective computation properties of a 
neural network based system address several problems associated with 
the implementation and performance of the scrim star ID algorithm. 
Instead of searching a lengthy database one clement at a time, each 
stored star pattern is correlated with the field of view concurrently. 
And whereas standard memory storage technology requires one address 
in RAM per star-pair distance, the neural star pattern representations are 
stored in characteristic matrices of interconnections between neurons. 
This distributed data set representation has several desirable properties. 
First of all, the 2N redundancy of the scrim star-pair scheme (i.e. which 
star is at which end of a pair) is discarded and a new more compressed 
representation emerges from the ncuromorphic architecture. Secondly, 
noise, both statistical (i.c thermal noise) and systematic (i.e. sensor 
precision limitations), and pattern invariancc characteristics are 
Neural Network Star Pattern Recognition 317 
incorporated directly into the preprocessing and neural architecture 
without extra circuitry. 
The first neural approach 
The primary motivation from the NASA perspective is to improve 
satellite attitude determination performance and enable on-board system 
implementations. The problem methodology for the neural architecture 
is then slightly different than that of the serial model. 
Instead of identifying every detected tfir in the field of view, the 
neural system identifies a single 'Guide Star' with respect to the pattern 
of dimmer stars around it, and correlates that star's known position with 
the sensor FOV to determine the pointing axis. If needed, only one other 
star is then required to fix the roll angle about that axis. So the core 
of the celestial attitude determination problem changes from multiple 
star identification and correlation, single star pattern identification. 
The entire system consists of several modules in a marriage of 
different technologies. The first neural system architecture uses already 
mature(i.e. sensor/preprocessor) technologies where they perform well, 
and neural technology only where conventional systems prove 
intractable. With an eye towards rapid prototyping and implementation, 
the system was designed with technologies (such as neural VLSI) that 
will be available in less than one year. 
SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE 
The Star Tracker sensor system 
The system input is based on the ASTROS II star tracker under 
development in the Guidance and Control section at the Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory. The Star tracker optical system images a defocussed portion 
of the sky (a star sub-field) onto a charged coupled device (C.C.D.). The 
tracker electronics then generate star centtold position and intensity 
information and passes this list to the preprocessing system. 
The Preprocessing system 
This centrol[ nd intensity information is passed to the preprocessing 
subsystem where the star pattern is treated to extract noise and pattern 
invariance. A 'pattern field-of-view' is defined as centered around the 
brightest (i.e. 'Guide Star') in the central portion of the sensor field-f- 
view. Since the pattern FOV radius is one half that of the sensor FOV 
the pattern for that 'Guide Star' is then based on a portion of the image 
that is complete, or invariant, under translational perturbation. The 
preprocessor then introduces rotational invariance to the 'guide-star' 
pattern by using only the distances of all other dimmer stars inside the 
pattern FOV to the central guide star. 
These distances are then mapped by the preprocessor onto a two 
dimensional coordinate system of distance versus relative magnitude 
(normalized to the guide star, the brightest star in the Pattern FOV) to 
be sampled by the neural associative star catalog. The motivation for 
this distance map format become clear when issues involving noise 
invariance and memory capacity are considered. 
318 Alvelda and San Martin 
Because the ASTROS Star Tracker is a limited precision instrument, 
most particularly in the absolute and relative intensity measures, two 
major problems arise. First, dimmer stars with intensities near the 
bottom of the dynamic range of the C.C.D. may or may not be included 
in the star pattern. So, the entire distance map is scaled to the brightest 
star such that the bright, high-confidence measurements are weighted
