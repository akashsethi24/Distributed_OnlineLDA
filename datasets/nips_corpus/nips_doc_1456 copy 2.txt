Abstract 
We previously proposed a quantitative model of early visual pro- 
cessing in primates, based on non-linearly interacting visual filters 
and statistically efficient decision. We now use this model to inter- 
pret the observed modulation of a range of human psychophysical 
thresholds with and without focal visual attention. Our model - 
calibrated by an automatic fitting procedure - simultaneously re- 
produces thresholds for four classical pattern discrimination tasks, 
performed while attention was engaged by another concurrent task. 
Our model then predicts that the seemingly complex improvements 
of certain thresholds, which we observed when attention was fully 
available for the discrimination tasks, can best be explained by a 
strengthening of competition among early visual filters. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
What happens when we voluntarily focus our attention to a restricted part of our 
visual field? Focal attention is often thought as a gating mechanism, which selec- 
tively allows a certain spatial location and and certain types of visual features to 
reach higher visual processes. We here investigate the possibility that attention 
might have a specific computational modulatory effect on early visual processing. 
We and others have observed that focal visual attention can modulate human psy- 
chophysical thresholds for simple pattern discrimination tasks [7, 8, 5] When atten- 
tion is drawn away from a task, for example by cueing [12] to another location 
of the display, or by a second, concurrent task [1, 7, 8], an apparently complex 
pattern of performance degradation is observed: For some tasks, attention has lit- 
tle or no effect on performance (e.g., detection of luminance increments), while for

other tasks, attention dramatically improves performance (e.g., discrimination of 
orientation). Our specific findings with dual-task psychophysics are detailed below. 
These observations have been paralleled by electrophysiological studies of attention. 
In the awake macaque, neuronal responses to attended stimuli can be 20% to 100% 
higher than to otherwise identical unattended stimuli. This has been demonstrated 
in visual cortical areas V1, V2, and V4 [16, 11, 10, 9] when the animal discriminates 
stimulus orientation, and in areas MT and MST when the animal discriminates the 
speed of stimulus motion [17]. Even spontaneous firing rates are 40% larger when 
attention is directed at a neuron's receptive field [9]. Whether neuronal responses 
to attended stimuli are merely enhanced [17] or whether they are also more sharply 
tuned for certain stimulus dimensions [16] remains controversial. Very recently, 
fMRI studies have shown similar enhancement (as measured with BOLD contrast) 
in area V1 of humans, specifically at the retinotopic location where subjects had 
been instructed to focus their attention to [2, 14]. 
All of these observations directly address the issue of the top-down computational 
effect of attentional focusing onto early visual processing stages. This issue should 
be distinguished from that of the bottom-up control of visual attention [6], which 
studies which visual features are likely to attract the attention focusing mecha- 
nism (e.g., pop-out phenomena and studies of visual search). Top-down attentional 
modulation happens after attention has been focused to a location of the visual 
field, and most probably involves the massive feedback circuits which anatomically 
project from higher cortical areas back to early visual processing areas. 
In the present study, we quantify the modulatory effect of attention observed in 
human psychophysics using a model of early visual processing. The model is based 
on non-linearly interacting visual filters and statistically efficient decision [4, 5]. 
Although attention could modulate virtually any visual processing stage (e.g., the 
decision stage, which compares internal responses from different stimuli), our basic 
hypothesis here - supported by electrophysiology and fMRI [16, 11, 10, 17, 9, 2, 14] - 
is that this modulation might happen very early in the visual processing hierarchy. 
Given this basic hypothesis, we investigate how attention should affect early visual 
processing in order to quantitatively reproduce the psychophysical results. 
2 PSYCHOPHYSICAL EXPERIMENTS 
We measured attentional modulation 
of spatial vision thresholds using a 
dual-task paradigm [15, 7]: At the 
center of the visual field, a letter dis- 
crimination task is presented, while 
a pattern discrimination task is si- 
multaneously presented at a random 
peripheral location (40 eccentricity). 
The central task consists of discrim- 
inating between five letters T or 
four T and one L. It has been 
shown to efficiently engage attention 
[7]. The peripheral task is chosen 
from a battery of a classical pattern 
discrimination tasks, and is the task 
of interest for this study. Psychophys-

condition, observers are asked to devote their entire attention to the peripheral

task, and to ignore the central task (while still fixating the center of the screen). 
In the 'poorly attended condition, observers are asked to pay full attention to 
the central task (and the blocks of trials for which performance for the central task 
falls below a certain cut-off are discarded). 
Four classical pattern discrimination tasks were investigated, each with two volun- 
teer subjects (average shown in Figure 1), similarly to our previous experiments 
[7, 8]. Screen luminance resolution was 0.2%. Screen luminance varied from I to 
90cd/m 2 (mean 45cd/m2), room illumination was 5cd/m 2 and viewing distance 
80cm. The Yes/No (present/absent) paradigm was used (one stimulus presentation 
per trial). Threshold (75% correct peformance) was reached using a staircase pro- 
cedure, and computed through a maximum-likelihood fit of a Weibull function with 
two degrees of freedom to the psychometric curves.

lgxp. 1 measured increment contrast discrimination threshold: The observer dis- 
criminates between a 4cpd (cycles per degree) stochastic oriented mask [7] at fixed 
contrast, and the same mask plus a low-contrast sixth-derivative-of-Gaussian (D6G) 
bar; threshold is measured for bar contrast [8]. lgxp. 2 measured orientation dis- 
crimination thresholds: The observer discriminates between a vertical and tilted 
grating at 4cpd; threshold for the angle difference is measured. In addition, two 
contrast masking tasks were investigated for their sensitivity to non-linearities in 
visual processing. A 4cpd stochastic mask (50% contrast) was always present, and 
threshold was measured for the contrast of a vertical superimposed D6G bar. In 
lgxp. 3, the orientation of the masker was varied and its spatial frequency fixed 
(4cpd), while in lgxp. 4 the spatial period of the masker was varied and its orien- 
tation vertical. Our aim was to investigate very dissimilar tasks, in particular with 
respect to the decision strategy used by the observer. 
Using the dual-task paradigm, we found mixed attentional effects on psychophysical 
thresholds, including the appearance of a more pronounced contrast discrimination

3 MODEL 
The model consists of three 
successive stages [4, 5]. In 
the first stage, a bank of 
Gabor-like linear filters ana- 
lyzes a fixed location of the 
visual scene. Here, a single- 
scale model composed of 12 
pairs of filters in quadrature 
phase, tuned for orientations 
0  � evenly spanning 180 �, 
was sufficient to account for 
the data (although a multi- 
scale model may account for 
Bandpass linear filters Non-linear interactions 
a wider range of psychophysical thresholds). The linear filters take values between 
0.0 and 100.0, then multiplied by a gain factor A (one of the ten free parameters of 
the model), and to which a small background activity e is added. 
In the second stage, filters non-linearly interact as follows: (1) Each unit receives 
non-linear self-excitation, and (2) each unit receives non-linear divisive inhibition 
from a pool of similarly-tuned units: With Eo being the linear response from a unit 
tuned for orientation O, the pooled response Ro is given by: 
where 
is a Gaussian weighting function centered around 0, and r/ a positive constant to 
account for background activity in the pooling stage. This stage is inspired from 
Heeger's model of gain control in cat V1 [3, 4]. Our formulation, in which none of 
the parameters is given a particular value, however allows for multiple outcomes, 
to be determined by fitting the model to our psychophysical data: A sigmoidal
