Abstract 
The inverse kinematics problem for redundant manipulators is ill-posed and 
nonlinear. There are two fundamentally different issues which result in the need 
for some form of regularization; the existence of multiple solution branches 
(global ill-posedness) and the existence of excess degrees of freedom (local ill- 
posedness). For certain classes of manipulators, learning methods applied to 
input-output data generated from the forward function can be used to globally 
regularize the problem by partitioning the domain of the forward mapping into 
a finite set of regions over which the inverse problem is well-posed. Local 
regularization can be accomplished by an appropriate parameterization of the 
redundancy consistently over each region. As a result, the ill-posed problem can 
be transformed into a finite set of well-posed problems. Each can then be solved 
separately to construct approximate direct inverse functions. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
The robot forward kinematics function maps a vector of joint variables to the end-effector 
configuration space, or workspace, here assumed to be Euclidean. We denote this mapping 
by f(.): O ' --, V  C_ ', f(O) - x, for 0 60 ' (the input space or joint space) 
and x  W m (the workspace). When m < n, we say that the manipulator has redundant 
degrees-of-freedom (doO. 
The inverse kinematics problem is the following: given a desired workspace location x, 
find joint variables 0 such that f(O) = x. Even when the forward kinematics is known,

the inverse kinematics for a manipulator is not generically solvable in closed form (Craig, 
1986). This problem is ill-posed  due to two separate phenomena. First, multiple solution 
branches can exist (for both non-redundant as well as redundant manipulators). The second 
source of ill-posedness arises because of the redundant dofs. Each of the inverse solution 
branches consists of a submanifold of dimensionality equal to the number of redundant 
dofs. Thus the inverse solution requires two regularizations; global regularization to select 
a solution branch, and local regularization, to resolve the redundancy. In this paper the 
existence of at least one solution is assumed; that is, inverses will be sought only for points 
in the reachable workspace, i.e. desired x in the image of f(.). 
Given input-output data generated from the kinematics mapping (pairs consisting of joint 
variable values & corresponding end-effector location), can the inverse mapping be learned 
without making any a priori regularizing assumptions or restrictions? We show that the 
answer can be yes. The approach taken towards the solution is based on the use of 
learning methods to partition the data into groups such that the inverse kinematics problem, 
when restricted to each group, is well-posed, after which a direct inverse function can be 
approximated on each group. 
A direct inverse function is desireable. For instance, a direct inverse is computable quickly; 
if implemented by a feedforward network were used, one function evaluation is equivalent to 
a single forward propagation. More importantly, theoretical results show that an algorithm 
for tracking a cyclic path in the workspace will produce a cyclic trajectory of joint angles 
if and only if it is equivalent to a direct inverse function (Baker, 1990). That is, inverse 
functions are necessary to ensure that when following a closed loop the ann configurations 
which result in the same end-effector location will be the same. 
Unfortunately, topological results show that a single global inverse function does not exist 
for generic robot manipulators. However, a global topological analysis of the kinematics 
function and the nature of the manifolds induced in the input space and workspace show 
that for certain robot geometries the mapping may be expressed as the union of a finite set 
of well-behaved local regions (Burdick, 1991). In this case, the redundancy takes the form 
of a submanifold which can be parameterized (locally) consistently by, for example, the 
use of topology preserving neural networks. 
2 TOPOLOGY AND ROBOT KINEMATICS 
It is known that for certain robot geometries the input space can be partitioned into disjoint 
regions which have the property that no more than one inverse solution branch lies within 
any one of the regions (Burdick, 1988). We assume in the following that the manipulator in 
question has such a geometry, and has all revolutejoints. Thus O ' - T n, the n-torus. The 
redundancy manifolds in this case have the topology of T n-m, n - m-dimensional torii. 
For O ' a compact manifold of dimensionality n, W m a compact manifold of dimensionality 
m, and f a smooth map from O ' to W , let the differential de f be the map from the tangent 
space of O ' at 0 60 ' to the tangent space of W  at f(O). The set of points in O ' which 
]Ill-posedness can arise from having either too many or too few constraints to result in a unique 
and valid solution. That is, an overconstrained system may be ill-posed and have no solutions; such 
systems are typically solved by finding a least-squares or some such minimum cost solution. An 
underconstrained system may have multiple (possibly infinite) solutions. The inverse kinematics 
problem for redundant manipulators is underconstrained.

map to x 6 YV  is the pre-image of x, denoted by f- (x). The differential der has a 
natural representation given by an m by n Jacobian matrix whose elements consist of the 
first partial derivatives of f w.r.t. a basis of 0 '. Define 3 as the set of critical points of f, 
which are the set of all 0 6 0 ' such that der(o) has rank less than the dimensionality of 
)4, '. Elements of the image of 3, f(3) are called the critical values. The set 7Ea=YV\3 
are the regular values of f. For 0  0 ', if 30*  f-(f(O)), O*  3, we call 0 a 
co-regular point of f. 
The kinematic mapping of certain classes of manipulators (with the geometry herein as- 
sumed) can be decomposed based on the co-regular surfaces which divide O into a finite 
number of disjoint, connected regions, Ci. The image of each Ci under f is a connected 
region in the workspace, )V. We denote the kinematics mapping restricted to Cto be f; 
Locally, one inverse solution branch for a region in the workspace has the structure of 
a product space. We conjecture that (Wi,7-n-m,Ci, fICi) forms a locally trivial fiber 
bundle 2 and that the ï¿½i, therefore, form regions where the inverse is unique modulo the 
redundancy. 
Given a point in the workspace, x, for which a configuration is sought, global regular- 
izafion requires choosing from among the multiple pre-image tofii. Local regularizafion 
(redundancy resolution) requires finding a location on the chosen torus. We would like to 
effectively rood out the redundancy manifolds by constructing an indexed one-to-one, 
invertible mapping from each pre-image manifold to a point in A 'm, and to obtain a con- 
sistent representation of the manifold by constructing an invertible mapping from itself to 
a set of n - m location parameters. 
3 GLOBAL REGULARIZATION 
The existence of multiple solutions for even non-redundant manipulators poses difficult 
problems. Usually (and often for plausible reasons) the manipulator's allowable configura- 
tions or task space is effectively constrained so that there exists only a single inverse solution 
(Martinetz et al., 1990; Kuperstein, 1991). This approach regularizes the problem by al- 
lowing the existence of only one-to-one data. We seek to generalize to the multi-solution 
case and to learn all of the possible solutions. 
For an all revolute manipulator there typically will be multiple pre-image torii for a particu- 
lar point in the workspace. The topology of the pre-image solution branches will generally 
be known from the type of geometry, although their number may not be obvious by inspec- 
tion, and will usually be different for different regions of the workspace. An upper bound on 
the number of inverse solutions is known (Burdick, 1988); consequently, the determination 
of the number could be made by search for the best fit among the possibilities. 
The sampling and clustering approach described in (DeMers & Kreutz-Delgado, 1992) 
can be used to partition input-output data into disjoint pre-image sets. This approach 
uses samples of the forward behavior to identify the sets in the input space which map to

a projection p mapping the total space to the base space with certain properties (here, the projection 
is equivalent to fi restricted to the total space). A locally trivial fiber bundle is one for which a 
consistent parameterization of the fibers is possible.
