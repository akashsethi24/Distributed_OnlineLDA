ABSTRACT 
A binary synaptic matrix chip has been developed for electronic 
neural networks. The matrix chip contains a programmable 32X32 
array of long channel NMOSFET binary connection elements imple- 
mented in a 3-um bulk CMOS process. Since the neurons are kept off- 
chip, the synaptic chip serves as a cascadable building block for 
a multi-chip synaptic network as large as 512X512 in size. As an 
alternative to the programmable NMOSFET {long channel) connection 
elements, tailored thin film resistors are deposited, in series with 
FET switches, on some CMOS test chips, to obtain the weak synaptic 
connections. Although deposition and patterning of the resistors 
require additional processing steps, they promise substantial 
savings in silcon area. The performance of a synaptic chip in a 32- 
neuron breadboard system in an associative memory test application 
is discussed. 
INTRODUCTION 
The highly parallel and distributive architecture of neural 
networks offers potential advantages in fault-tolerant and high 
speed associative information processing. For the past few years, 
there has been a growing interest in developing electronic hardware 
to investigate the computational capabilities and application 
potential of neural networks as well as their dynamics and 
collective properties -5 . In an electronic hardware implementation 
of neural networks s,? , the neurons (analog processing units) are 
represented by threshold amplifiers and the synapses linking the 
neurons by a resistive connection network. The synaptic strengths 
between neurons (the electrical resistance of the connections) 
represent the stored information or the computing function of the 
neural network. 
Because of the massive interconectivity of the neurons and the 
large number of the interconnects required with the increasing 
number of neurons, implementation of a synaptic network using 
current LSI/VLSI technology can become very difficult. A synaptic 
network based on a multi-chip architecture would lessen this 
difficulty. We have designed, fabricated, and successfully tested 
CMOS-based programmable synaptic chips which could serve as basic 
cascadable building blocks for a multi-chip electronic neural 
network. The synaptic chips feature complete programmability of 
1024, (32X32) binary synapses. Since the neurons are kept off- 
chip, the synaptic chips can be connected in parallel, to obtain 
multiple grey levels of the connection strengths, as well as

cascaded to form larger synaptic arrays for an expansion to a 512- 
neuron system in a feedback or feed-forward architecture. As a 
research tool, such a system would offer a significant speed 
improvement over conventional software-based neural network 
simulations since convergence times for the parallel hardware system 
would be significantly smaller. 
In this paper, we describe the basic design and operation of 
synaptic CMOS chips incorporating MOSFET's as binary connection 
elements. The design and fabrication of synaptic test chips with 
tailored thin film resistors as ballast resistors for controlling 
power dissipation are also described. Finally, we describe a 
synaptic chip-based 32-neuron breadboard system in a feedback 
configuration and discuss its performance in an associative memory 
test application. 
BINARY SYNAPTIC CMOS CHIP WITH MOSFET CONNECTION ELEMENTS 
There are two important design requirements for a binary 
connection element in a high density synaptic chip. The first 
requirement is that the connection in the ON state should be weak 
to ensure low overall power dissipation. The required degree of 
weakness of the ON connection largely depends on the synapse 
density of the chip. If, for example, a synapse density larger than 
1000 per chip is desired, a dynamic resistance of the ON connection 
should be greater than ~100 K-ohms. The second requirement is that 
to obtain grey scale synapses with up to four bits of precision from 
binary connections, the consistency of the ON state connection 
resistance must be better than +/-5 percent, to ensure proper 
threshold operation of the neurons. Both of the requirements are 
generally difficult to satisfy simultaneously in conventional VLSI 
CMOS technology. For example, doped-polysilicon resistors could be 
used to provide the weak connections, but they are difficult to 
fabricate with a resistance uniformity of better than 5 percent. 
We have used NMOSFET's as connection elements in a multi-chip 
synaptic network. By designing the NMOSFET's with long channel, 
both the required high uniformity and high ON state resistance have 
been obtained. A block diagram of a binary synaptic test chip 
incorporating NMOSFET's as programmable connection elements is shown 
in Fig. 1. A photomicrograph of the chip is shown in Fig. 2. The 
synaptic chip was fabricated through MOSIS (MOS Implementation 
Service) in a 3-micron, bulk CMOS, two-level metal, P-well 
technology. The chip contains 1024 synaptic cells arranged in a 
32X32 matrix configuration. Each cell consists of a long channel 
NMOSFET connected in series with another NMOSFET serving as a simple 
ON/OFF switch. The state of the FET switch is controlled by the 
output of a latch which can be externally addressed via the ROW/COL 
address decoders. The 32 analog input lines {from the neuron 
outputs) and 32 analog output lines {to the neuron inputs} allow a 
number of such chips to be connected together to form larger 
connection matrices with up to 4-bit planes. 
The long channel NMOSFET can function as either a purely 
resistive or a constant current source connection element, depending

on whether analog or binary output neurons are used. As a resistive 
connection, the NMOSFET's must operate in the linear region of the 
transistor's drain I-V characteristics. In the linear region, the 
channel resistance is approximately given by 8 
Ro = (l/K) (L/W) (VG - 
567 
Here, K is a proportionality constant which depends on process 
parameters, L and W are the channel length and width respectively, 
Vc is the gate voltage, and VT, is the threshold voltage. The 
transistor acts as a linear resistor provided the voltage across the 
channel is much less than the difference of the gate and threshold 
voltages, and thus dictates the operating voltage range of the 
connection. The NMOSFET's presently used in our synaptic chip 
design have a channel length of 244 microns and width of 12 microns. 
At a gate voltage of 5 volts, a channel resistance of about 200 K- 
ohms was obtained over an operating voltage range of 1.5 volts. The 
consistency of the transistor I-V characteristics has been verified 
to be within +/-3 percent in a single chip and +/-5 percent for 
chips from different fabrication runs. In the latter case, the 
transistor characteristics in the linear region can be further 
matched to within +/-3% by the fine adjustment of their common gate 
bias. 
With two-state neurons, current source connections may be used 
by operating the transistor in the saturation mode. Provided the 
voltage across the channel is greater than (Vc - VT,], the 
transistor behaves almost as a constant current source with the 
saturation current given approximately by  
Io = K {W/L) {Vc - VT.)  
With the appropriate selection of L, W, and W, it is possible to 
obtain ON-state currents which vary by two orders of magnitude in 
values. Figure 3 shows a set of measured I-V curves for a NMOSFET 
with the channel dimensions, L= 244 microns and W=12 microns and 
applied gate voltages from 2 to 4.5 volts. To ensure constant 
current source operation, the neuron's ON-state output should be 
greater than 3.5 volts. A consistency of the ON-state currents to 
within +/-5 percent has similarly been observed in a set of chip 
samples. With current source connections therefore, quantized grey 
scale synapses with up to 16 grey levels (4 bits) can be realized 
using a network of binary weighted current sources.

For proper operation of the NMOSFET connections, the analog 
output lines (to neuron inputs} should always be held close to 
ground potential. Moreover, the voltages at the analog input lines 
must be at or above ground potential. Since the current normally 
568 
flows from the analog input to the output, the NMOSFET's may be used 
as either all excitatory or inhibitory type connections. However, 
the complementary connection function can be realized using long 
channel PMOSFET's in series with PMOSFET switches. For a PMOSFET 
connection, the voltage of an analog input line would be at or below 
ground. Furthermore, due to the difference in the mobilires of 
electrons and holes in the channel, a PMOSFET used as a resistive 
connection has a channel resistance about twice as large as an 
NMOSFET with the same channel dimension. This fact results in a 
subtantial reduction in the size of PMOSFET needed. 
THIN FILM RESISTOR CONNECTIONS 
The use of MOSFET's as connection elements in a CMOS synaptic 
matrix chip has the major advantage that the complete device can be 
readily fabricated in a conventional CMOS production run. However, 
the main disadvantages are the large area (required for the long 
channel] for the MOSFET's connections and their non-symmetrical
