Abstract 
The encoding of random time-varying stimuli in single spike trains 
of electrosensory neurons in the weakly electric fish Eigenmannia 
was investigated using methods of statistical signal processing. At 
the first stage of the electrosensory system, spike trains were found 
to encode faithfully the detailed time-course of random stimuli, 
while at the second stage neurons responded specifically to features 
in the temporal waveform of the stimulus. Therefore stimulus infor- 
mation is processed at the second stage of the electrosensory system 
by extracting temporal features from the faithfully preserved image 
of the environment sampled at the first stage. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
The weakly electric fish, Eigenmannia, generates a quasi sinusoidal, dipole-like elec- 
tric field at individually fixed frequencies (250 - 600 Hz) by discharging an electric 
organ located in its tail (see Bullock and Heilgenberg, 1986 for reviews). The fish 
sense local changes in the electric field by means of two types of tuberous electrore- 
ceptors located on the body surface. T-type electroreceptors fire phase-locked to 
the zero-crossing of the electric field once per cycle of the electric organ discharge

(EOD) and are thus able to encode phase changes. P-type electroreceptors fire in 
a more loosely phase-locked manner with a probability smaller than 1 per EOD. 
Their probability of firing increases with the mean amplitude of the field thereby 
allowing them to encode amplitude changes (Zakon, 1986). 
This information is used by the fish in order to locate objects (electrolocation, 
Bastian 1986) as well as for communication with conspecifics (Hopkins, 1988). One 
behavior which has been most thoroughly studied (Heiligenberg, 1991), the jamming 
avoidance response, occurs when two fish with similar EOD frequency (less than 
15 Hz difference) approach close enough to sense each other's field. In order to 
minimize beat patterns resulting from their summed electric fields, the fish with 
the higher (resp. lower) rOD raises further (resp. lowers) its own rOD frequency. 
The resulting frequency difference increase reduces the distorsions in the interfering 
EODs. The fish is known to correlate phase differences computed across body 
regions with local amplitude increases or decreases in order to determine whether 
it should raise or lower its own EOD. 
At the level of the first central nervous nucleus of the electrosensory pathway, the 
electrosensory lateral line lobe of the hindbrain (ELL), phase and amplitude in- 
formation are processed nearly independently of each other (Maler et al., 1981). 
Amplitude information is encoded in the spike trains of ELL pyramidal cells that 
receive input from P-receptor afferents and transmit their information to higher 
order levels of the electrosensory system. Two functional classes of pyramidal cells 
are distinguished: E-type pyramidal cells respond by raising their firing frequency 
to increases in the amplitude of an externally applied electric field while I-type pyra- 
midal cells increase their firing frequency when the amplitude decreases (Bastian, 
1981). 
The aim of this study was to characterize the temporal information processing 
performed by ELL pyramidal cells on random electric field amplitude modulations 
and to relate it to the information carried by P-receptor afferents. To this end 
we recorded the responses of P-receptor afferents and pyramidal cells to random 
electric field amplitude modulations and analyzed them using two different methods: 
a signal estimation method characterizing to what extent the neuronal response 
encodes the detailed.time-course of the stimulus and a signal-detection method 
developed to identify features encoded in spike trains. These two methods as well 
as the electrophysiology are explained in the next section followed by the result 
section and a short discussion. 
2 METHODS 
2.1 ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY 
Adult specimens of Eigenmannia were immobilized by intramuscular injection of 
a curare-like drug (Flaxedil). This also strongly attenuated the fish's EODs. The 
fish were held in place by a foam-lined clamp in an experimental tank and an EOD 
substitute electric field was established by two electrodes placed in the mouth and 
near the tail of the fish. The carrier frequency of the electric field, feartier, was 
chosen equal to the EOD frequency prior to curarization and the voltage generating 
the stimulus was modulated according to 
V(t) = Ao(1 + S(t))COS(2rfcarrir), 
where A0 is the mean amplitude and s(t) is a random, zero-mean modulation having 
a fiat (white) spectrum up to a variable cut-off frequency fc and a variable standard 
deviation a. The modulation s(t) was generated by playing a blank tape on a tape

recorder, passing the signal through a variable cut-off frequency low-pass filter before 
multiplying it by the frequency carrier signal in a function generator (fig. 1A). 
Extracellular recordings from P-receptor afferents were made by exposing the an- 
terior lateral line nerve. Intracellular recordings from ELL pyramidal cells were 
obtained by positioning electrodes in the central region of the pyramidal cell layer. 
Intracellular recording electrodes were filled with neurotracer (neurobiotin) to be 
used for subsequent intracellular labeling if the recordings were stable long enough. 
This allowed to verify the cell type and its location within the ELL. In case no intra- 
cellular labeling could be made the recording site was verified by setting electrolytic 
lesions at the conclusion of the experiment. In the subsequent data analysis, data 
from E- and I-type pyramidal cells and from two different maps (centromedial and 
lateral, Carr et al., 1982) were pooled. For further experimental details, see Wessel 
et al. (1996), Metzner and Heiligenberg (1991), Metzner (1993). 
2.2 SIGNAL ESTIMATION 
The ability of single spike trains to carry detailed time-varying stimulus information 
was assessed by estimating the stimulus from the spike train. The spike trains, 
x(t) =  6( - ti), where ti are the spike ocurrence times, were convolved with a 
filter h (Wiener-Kolmogorov filtering; Poor, 1994; Bialek et al. 1991), 
chosen in order to minimize the mean square error between the true stimulus and 
the estimated stimulus, 
((40- 
The optimal filter h(t) is determined in Fourier space as the ratio of the Fourier 
transform of the cross-correlation between stimulus and spike train, R,(r) = 
(x(t)s(t + r)) and the Fourier transform of the autocorrelation (power spectrum) of 
the spike train, R(r) = ((t)x(t + r)). The accuracy at which single spike trains 
transmit information about the stimulus was characterized in the time domain by 
the coding fraction, defined as 7 = 1 - e/r, were r is the standard deviation of 
the stimulus. The coding fraction is normalized between 1 when the stimulus is 
perfectly estimated by the spike train (ï¿½ = 0) and 0, when the estimation perfor- 
mance of the spike train is at chance level ( = r). Thus, the coding fraction can be

estimation method in the context of neuronal sensory processing, see Gabbiani and 
Koch (1996) and Gabbiani (1996). 
2.3 FEATURE EXTRACTION 
2.3.1 General procedure 
The ability of single spikes to encode the presence of a temporal feature in the stim- 
ulus waveform was assessed by adapting a Fisher linear discriminant classification 
scheme to our data (Anderson, 1984; sect. 6.5). Each random stimulus wave-form 
and spike response of pyramidal cells (resp. P-receptor afferents) were binned. The 
bin size A was varied between Amin = 0.5 ms, corresponding to the sampling ra- 
tio and Amax, corresponding to the longest interval leading to a maximum of one 
spike per bin. The sampling interval yielding the best performance (see below) was 
finally retained. Typical bin sizes were A = 7 ms for pyramidal cells (typical mean 
firing rate: 30 Hz) and A -- 1 ms for P-receptor afferents (typical firing rate: 200 
Hz). The mean stimulus preceding a spike containing bin (ml) or no-spike con- 
taining bin (m0) as well as the covariances (1, 0) of these distributions were 
computed (Anderson, 1984; sect. 3.2). Mean vectors (resp. covariance matrices) 
had at most 100 (resp. 100 x 100) components. The optimal linear feature vector 
f predicting the occurrence or non-occurrence of a spike was found by maximizing 
the signal-to-noise ratio (see fig. 2A and Poor, 1994; sect. IIIB)

The vector f is solution of (m I - m0) = (Z0 + Z1) f. This equation was solved by 
diagonalizing Z0 + Z1 and retaining the first n largest eigenvalues accounting for 
99% of the variance (Jolliffe, 1986; sect. 6.1 and 8.1). The
