Abstract 
We introduce a geometric approach for investigating the power of threshold 
circuits. Viewing n-variable boolean functions as vectors in , we invoke 
tools from linear algebra and linear programming to derive new results on 
the realizability of boolean functions using threshold gates. 
Using this approach, one can obtain: (1) upper-bounds oil the number of 
spurious memories in IIopfield networks, and on the number of functions 
implementable by a depth-d threshold circuit; (2) a lower bound on the 
number of orthogonal input fuuctions required to ilnplement a threshold 
function; (3) a necessary condition for all arbitrary set of input fimctions to 
implement a threshold filnction; (4) a lower bound on the error introduced 
in approximating boolean functions using sparse polynomials; (5) a limit 
on the effectiveness of the only known lower-bound technique (based on 
computing correlations among booleall fimctions) for the depth of thresh- 
old circuits implementing boolean fimctions, and (6) a constructive proof 
that every boolean function f of n input variables is a threshold function 
of polynomially many input functions, none of which is significantly cor- 
related with f. Some of these restilts lead to genera. lizations of key restilts 
concerning threshold circuit complexity, particularly those that are based 
on tile so-called spectral or IIarmonic analysis approach. Moreover, our 
geometric approach yields simple proofs, based on elementary resnlts fi'om 
linear algebra, for many of these earlier results.

1 Introduction 
An S-input threshold gate is characterized by S real weights Wl,. �., WS. It takes S 
inputs: x,..., xs, each either +1 or -1, and outputs +1 if the linear combination 
ziS=l WiZ i is positive and -1 if the linear COlllbination is negative. Threshold gates 
were recently used to implement several functions of practical interest (including: 
Parity, Addition, Multiplication, Division, and Comparison) with fewer gates and 
reduced depth than conventional circuits using AND, OR, and NOT gates [12, 4, 11]. 
This success has led to a considerable amount of research on tile power of threshold 
circuits [1, 10, 9, ll, 3, 13]. Itowever, even simple questions remain unanswered. It 
is not known, for example, whether there is a function that call be computed by a 
depth-3 threshold circuit with polynomially many gates but cannot be computed 
by any depth-2 circuit with polynomially many threshold gates. 
Geometric approaches have proven usetiff for analyzing threshold gates. An S-input 
threshold gate corresponds to a hyperplane in 7. s. This has been used for example 
to count the number of boolean functions computable by a single threshold gate [6], 
and also to determine functions that cannot be implemented by a single threshold 
gate. IIowever, threshold circuits of depth two or more do not carry a simple geo- 
metric interpretation in s. The inputs to gates in the second levcl are themselves 
threshold functions, hence the linear COlnbination conputed at the second level is 
a non-linear function of the inputs. Lackiug a geometric view, researchers [5, 3] 
have used indirect approaches, applying harmonic-analysis techniques to analyze 
threshold gates. These techniques, apart from their complexity, restricted the input 
functions of the gates to be of very special types: input variables or parities of the 
input variables, thus not applying evcn to depth-two circuits. 
In this paper, we describe a simple geometric relation between tile output function 
of a threshold gate and its set of input filnctions. This applies to arbitrary sets of 
input functions. Using this rclation, we can prove the folloxving results: (1) upper 
bounds on (a) tile number of threshold fimctions of any set of input functions, (b) 
the number of spurious memorics in a IIopficld network, and (c) tile number of 
functions implementable by threshold circuits of depth d; (2) a lower bound on the 
number of orthogonal input functions requircd to implement a threshold function; 
(3) a quantifiable necessary condition for a set of fimctions to implement a threshold 
function; (4) a lower bound on the error ill approxinlating booleall functions using 
sparse polynomials; (5) a limit on tile effectiveness of the correlation method used 
in [7] to prove that a certain function cannot be implemented by depth two circuits 
with polynomially many gates and polynolnially bounded weights; (6) a proof that 
every function f is a threshold function of polynolnially many input functions, none 
of which is significantly correlated with f. 
Special cases of some of these results, wilere tile input functions to a threshold gate 
are restricted to the input variables, or parities of the input variables, were proven 
in [5, 3] using harnlonic-analysis tools. Our technique shows that these tools are 
not needed, providing simpler proofs for illore general results. 
Due to space limitations, we cannot present tile fifil details of our results. Instead, 
we shall introduce the basic definitions followed by a technical summary of the 
results; the emphasis will be on pointing out the lnotivation and relating our results

with those in the literature. The proofs and other technical details will appear in a 
complete journal paper. 
2 Definitions and Background 
An n-variable boolean function is a mapping f: {-1, 1} -- {-1, 1}. We view f 
as a (column) vector in T� 2. Each of f's 2 components is either -1 or +1 and 
represents f(x) for a distinct value assignment x of the n boolean variables. We view 
the S weights of an S-input threshold gate as a weight vector w = (w,. �., ws?' 
in T� s . 
Let the functions fl,. �., fs be the inputs of a threshold gate w. The gate computes 
a function f (or f is the output of the gate) if the following vector equation holds: 
f =sgn.(kfiwi ) (1) 
i=1 
where 
+1 ifx >0, 
sgn(x) = -1 if x < 0, 
undefined if x = 0. 
Note that this definition requires that all components of y]./s=x fiwi be nonzero. It 
is convenient to write Equation (1) in a lnatrix form: 
f -- sgn(�w) 
where the input matrix 
� = [f...fsl 
is a 2 by S matrix whose columns are the input functious. The function f, is a 
threshold function of f,..., fs if there exists a threshold gate (i.e., w) with inputs 
fx,..., fs that computes f. 
These definitions form the basis of our approach. Each function, being a +1 vector 
in 2, determines an ortbant in .. A function f is the output of a threshold gate 
whose input functions are fx,..., fs if and only if the linear colnbination -]/s= fiwi 
defined by the gate lies inside the orthant deterlnined by f. 
Definition 1 Tb, e correlation of two n-variable booleau functions fi and f2 is: 
C//. : 
the two functions are uncorrelated or orthogonal if C.f/ = O. 
Note that Cj,j. = 1 - 2du(f, rs)/2 where du(fx, rs) is the Ilamnfing distance 
between fx and fu; thus, the correlation can be interpreted as a lneasure of how 
'close' the two functions are. 
Fix the input functions fx,...fs to a threshold gate. The correlalion veclor of a 
function f, with the input functions is 
CD , = (yTf)/2,= (C C ... CLts) T. 
Next, we define  a.s the maximuln in lnagnitude alnong the correlation coefficients, 
i.e., 0 -

3 Summary of Results 
The correlation between two n-variable functions is a multiple of 2-(-t), bounded 
between -1 and 1, hence can assume 2 + 1 values. The correlation vector Cj, y = 
(Cj, A,... , Cj, A) acan therefore assume at most (2 + 1) s different values. There are 
2 2n Boolean functions of n Boolean variables, hence many share the same correlation 
vector. However, the next theorem says that a threshold function of ft,..., fs does 
not share its correlation vector with any other fimction. 
Uniqueness Theorem Lel f be a lhreshold function of f t,..., fs. Then, for all 
gf, 
%r -� c;� 
Corollary i There are at most (2 n q- 1) s threshold functions of any set ors input 
functions. 
The special case of the Uniqueness Theorem where the functions f,..., fs are 
the input variables had been proven in [5, 9]. The proof used harmonic-analysis 
tools such as Parseval's theoreln. It relied on the mutual orthogonality of the input 
functions (namely, C,, = 0 for all i  j). Another special case where the input 
functions are parities of the input variables was proven in [3]. The same proof 
was used; see e.g. , pages 419-422 of [9]. Our proof shows that the harmonic- 
analysis tools and assumptions are not needed thereby (1) significantly simplifying 
the proof, and (2) showing that the functions ft,..., fs need not be orthogonal: 
the Uniqueness Theorem holds for all collections of functions. The more general 
result of the Uniqueness Theorem can be applied to obtain the following two new 
counting results. 
Corollary 2 The number of stable states in a Hopfield network with n elements 
which is programmed by ihe outer product rule to store s given vectors is < 
2 s 1og(n+l). -- 
Corollary 3 Let Fn(S(n), d) be ihe number ofn-variable booleaa functions comput- 
ed by depth-d threshold circuits with fan-in bounded by S(n) (we assume S(n) > n). 
Then, for all d, n > 1,

It follows easily from our geometric framework that if C'j,. = 0 then f is not a 
threshold function of fl,..., rs: every linear colnbination of f,..., fs is orthogonal 
to f, hence cannot intersect the orthant determined by f. 
Next, we consider the
