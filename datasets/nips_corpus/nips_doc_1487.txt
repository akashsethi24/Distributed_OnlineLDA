Abstract 
The contrast response function (CRF) of many neurons in the primary vi- 
sual cortex saturates and shifts towards higher contrast values following 
prolonged presentation of high contrast visual stimuli. Using a recurrent 
neural network of excitatory spiking neurons with adapting synapses we 
show that both effects could be explained by a fast and a slow compo- 
nent in the synaptic adaptation. (i) Fast synaptic depression leads to sat- 
uration of the CRF and phase advance in the cortical response to high 
contrast stimuli. (ii) Slow adaptation of the synaptic transmitter release 
probability is derived such that the mutual information between the input 
and the output of a cortical neuron is maximal. This component--given 
by infomax learning rule--explains contrast adaptation of the averaged 
membrane potential (DC component) as well as the surprising experi- 
mental result, that the stimulus modulated component (F1 component) 
of a cortical cell's membrane potential adapts only weakly. Based on our 
results, we propose a new experiment to estimate the strength of the ef- 
fective excitatory feedback to a cortical neuron, and we also suggest a 
relatively simple experimental test to justify our hypothesized synaptic 
mechanism for contrast adaptation. 
1 Introduction 
Cells in the primary visual cortex have to encode a wide range of contrast levels, and they 
still need to be sensitive to small changes in the input intensities. Because the signaling 
capacity is limited, this paradox can be resolved only by a dynamic adaptation to changes 
in the input intensity distribution: the contrast response function (CRF) of many neurons 
in the primary visual cortex shifts towards higher contrast values following prolonged pre- 
sentation of high contrast visual stimuli (Ahmed et al. 1997, Carandini & Ferster 1997). 
On the one hand, recent experiments, suggest that synaptic plasticity has a major role 
Contrast Adaptation and Infomax 77 
in contrast adaptation. Because local application of GABA does not mediate adaptation 
(Vidyasagar 1990) and the membrane conductance does not increase significantly during 
adaptation (Ahmed et al. 1997, Carandini & Ferster 1997), lateral inhibition is unlikely to 
account for contrast adaptation. In contrast, blocking glutamate (excitatory) autoreceptors 
decreases the degree of adaptation (McLean & Palmer 1996). Furthermore, the adaptation 
is stimulus specific (e.g. Carandini et al. 1998), it is strongest if the adapting and testing 
stimuli are the same. On the other hand, plasticity of synaptic weights (e.g. Chance et 
al. 1998) cannot explain the weak adaptation of the stimulus driven modulations in the 
membrane potential (F1 component) (Carandini & Ferster 1997) and the retardation of the 
response phase after high contrast adaptation (Saul 1995). These experimental findings 
motivated us to explore how presynaptic factors, such as a long term plasticity mediated 
by changes in the transmitter release probability (Finlayson & Cynader 1995) affect con- 
trast adaptation. 
2 The single cell and the cortical circuit model 
The cortical cells are modeled as leaky integrators with a firing threshold of -55 mV. The 
interspike membrane potential dynamics is described by 
C,m 0� ( t ) 
0---[- = --aeak (�(t) -- Erest) -- (�(t) -- Esyn) � (1) 
The postsynaptic conductance gij (t) is the integral over the previous presynaptic events 
and is described by the alpha-function 
Ispikesl t 
gij(t) = gmax  Pij(t;)'lij(t;)' (t- t;).exp (1 --tj), (2) 
Tpeak s Tpeak 
where tj is the arrival time of spike number s from neuron j. Including short term synaptic 
depression, the effective conductance is weighted by the portion of the synaptic resource 
Pij (t) � lij (t) that targets the postsynaptic side. The model parameters are Cm = 0.5 nF, 
gleak -- 31 nS, Erest -- -65 mV, Esyn --5 mV, _xc = = 
-- - $tma x 7.8 nS, and ;peak 1 ms, 
and the absolute refractory period is 2 ms, and after a spike, the membrane potential is re- 
set 1 mV below the resting potential. Following Tsodyks & Markram (1997) a synapse 
between neurons j and i is characterized by the relative portion of the available synaptic 
transmitter or resource lrij. After a presynaptic event, lrij decreases by Pij lrij, and re- 
covers exponentially, where pij is the transmitter release probability. The time evolution 
of Rij between two presynaptic spikes is then 
ij(t) '- 1 - (1 - (ij(t) - Pij()ij(i)))exp , (3) 
Trec 
where i is the last spike time, and the recovery time constant rr� = 200 ms. Assuming 
Poisson distributed presynaptic firing, the steady state of the expected resource is

The stationary mean excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) Ii7 (fj, Pij) is proportional to 
the presynaptic firing frequency fj and the activated transmitter pij Rj (fj, Pij) 
I7(fj,Pij) cx f Pij RiT(fj,Pij) . (5) 
The mean current saturates for high input rates fj and it also depends on the transmitter 
release probability Pij: with a high release probability the function is steeper at low presy- 
naptic frequencies but saturates earlier than for a low release probability.

p--0.55 (0.24) corresponds to adaptation to 1% (50%) contrast (see Section 4). 
In order to study contrast adaptation, 30 leaky-integrator neurons are connected fully via 
excitatory fast adapting synapses. Each cortical leaky integrator neuron receives its 
geniculate input through 30 synapses. The presynaptic geniculate spike-trains are inde- 
pendent Poisson-processes. Modeling visual stimulation with a drifting grating, their rates 
are modulated sinusoidally with a temporal frequency of 2 Hz. The background activity for 
each individual geniculate source is drawn from a Gaussian distribution with a mean of 
20 Hz and a standard deviation of 5 Hz. In the model the mean geniculate firing rate (Fig. 
2b) and the amplitude of modulation (Fig. 2a) increases with stimulus log contrast accord- 
ing to the experimental data (Kaplan et al. 1987). In the following simulations CRFs are 
determined according to the protocol of Carandini & Ferster (1997). The CRFs are calcu- 
lated using an initial adaptation period of 5 s and a subsequent series of interleaved test and 
re-adaptation stimuli (1 s each). 
3 The learning rule 
We propose that contrast adaptation in a visual cortical cell is a result of its goal to maxi- 
mize the amount of information the cell's output conveys about the geniculate input  . Fol- 
lowing (Bell & Sejnowski 1995) we derive a learning rule for the transmitter release proba- 
bility p to maximize the mutual information between a cortical cell's input and output. Let 
O(f, p) be the average output firing rate, f the presynaptic firing rate, and p the synaptic 
transmitter release probability. Maximizing the mutual information is then equivalent to 
maximizing the entropy of a neuron's output if we assume only additive noise: 
H [O(f,p)] - -E [ln Prob(O(f,p))] 
Prob(f) 
: -I In 100(f,p)/Ofl] 
: E[lnlOO(f'P) I - E[lnProb(f)] . (6) 
(In the following all equations apply locally to a synapse between neurons j and i.) 
In order to derive an analytic expression for the relation between O and f we use the fact 
that the EPSP amplitude converges to its steady state relatively fast compared to the mod- 
ulation of the geniculate input to the visual cortex, and that the average firing rates of the 
A different approach of maximizing mutual information between input and output of a single 
spiking neuron has been developed by Stemmler & Koch (1999). For non-spiking neurons this strat- 
egy has been demonstrated experimentally by, e.g. Laughlin (1994). 
Contrast Adaptation and Infomax 79 
presynaptic neurons are approximately similar. Thus we approximate the activation func- 
tion by 
O(f,p) oc S(f) pR(f,p), 
(7) 
where S(f) - f+o accounts for the frequency dependent summation of EPSCs. The 
parameters o = 1.8 and � = 15 Hz are determined by fitting O(f,p) to the firing rate 
of our integrate and fire single cell model (see Fig. la). The objective function is then 
maximized by a stochastic gradient ascent learning rule for the release probability p

This is similar in spirit to the anti-Hebbian learning mechanism for the synaptic strength 
proposed by Barlow & F61difik (1989) to explain adaptation phenomena. Here, the first 
term is proportional to the presynaptic firing rate f and to the available synaptic resource 
R, suggesting a presynaptic mechanism for the learning. Because the amplitude of the 
EPSP is proportional to the available synaptic resource, we could interpret/ as an output 
related quantity and -2rr�fR as an anti-Hebbian learning rule for the strength of the 
synapse, i.e. the probability p of the transmitter release. The second term ensures that
