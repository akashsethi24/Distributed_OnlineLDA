Abstract 
In this paper we describe the architecture, implementation and experi- 
mental results for an Intracardiac Electrogram (ICEG) classification and 
compression chip. The chip processes and vector-quantises 30 dimen- 
sional analogue vectors while consuming a maximum of 2.5 W power 
for a heart rate of 60 beats per minute (1 vector per second) from a 3.3 V 
supply. This represents a significant advance on previous work which 
achieved ultra low power supervised morphology classification since the 
template matching scheme used in this chip enables unsupervised blind 
classification of abnormal rhythms and the computational support for low 
bit rate data compression. The adaptive template matching scheme used 
is tolerant to amplitude variations, and inter- and intra-sample time shifts. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) are devices used to monitor the electrical 
activity of the heart muscle and to apply appropriate levels of electrical stimulation if ab- 
normal conditions are detected. Despite the considerable success of ICDs they suffer from 
a number of limitations including an inability to detect and treat some abnormal heart 
rhythms and limited data recording capabilities. 
We have previously shown that micropower analogue Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neu- 
ral networks can be trained to separate such arrhythmia [4]. However, MLPs are best suited 
to learning the boundary between classes whereas a vector quantization scheme allows a 
measure of the probability density of the morphological types to be estimated. 
Many analogue vector quantiser (VQ) chips have been reported in the literature. For ex- 
ample, a 16x256 500 kHz 50 mW 2 m CMOS vector A/D converter [10] and a 16 x 16 
300 kHz 0.7 mW 2 m CMOS analogue VQ [1]. These correspond to an energy per match 
672 R. d. Coggins, R. d. W. Wang and M. A. dabri 
per dimension of 24 pJ and 9 pJ respectively. The integrated circuit (IC) described in 
this paper is distinguished from these approaches in that it is specifically targeted for the 
low power, low bandwidth application of ICEG classification and compression. Our chip 
achieves vector matching (without the winner take all function) to 7 bit 30 dimensional 
vectors with three coefficient linear prediction, at an energy consumption of 15 pJ per tem- 
plate per dimension using a 1.2/m CMOS process. Although this figure is greater than 
that for [1] it should be noted that in [1] the mean absolute error metric is used rather than 
the squared Euclidean distance and no provision is provided for linear transformation of 
the incoming analogue vector. 
2 ADAPTIVE DATA COMPRESSION 
Recording of ICEGs in ICDs is currently very limited due to the amount of memory avail- 
able and the power/area cost of implementing all but the simplest compression techniques. 
Micropower template matching however, enables large amounts of the signal to be encoded 
as template indices plus amplitude parameters. Effective compression of the ICEG requires 
adaptation to the short term non-stationary behaviour of the ICEG [2]. In particular, short 
term amplitude variations, lag variation, phase variation and ectopic beats (which origi- 
nate from the ventricles of the heart and have differing morphology) reduce the achievable 
compression. The impact of ectopic beats can be reduced by increasing the number of 
templates. This can often be achieved without increasing the code book search complexity 
by using associated timing features. The amplitude and shift variations require short term 
adaptation of the template matching in order to minimise the residual error and hence raise 
the compression ratio at fixed distortion. 
2.1 Amplitude and Shift Invariant Matching 
In order to facilitate analogue implementation, a backward prediction procedure is used 
rather than the usual forward prediction [8]. This approach allows the incoming analogue 
template to be manipulated in the analogue domain for amplitude and shift invariance pur- 
poses. Consider the long term backward prediction problem described by, 
rb(T) -- :(T) -- box(T q- ) -- b I {X(T q- O q- 1) - x(n + c - 1)} (1) 
2 
where rb (n) denotes the backward residuals, : is a template which is a function of previous 
beats, x(c) is the sampled ICEG signal, c the time index, n is the template index and bo and 
bl are the amplitude and phase coefficients respectively. bo scales the current beat to match 
the template and hence is an amplitude term. bl scales the central difference of the current 
beat and is a function of the amplitude and phase corrections required to minimise the 
residuals. To see why this is a phase term consider the Taylor expansion of Ax(t + ok) to 
the first derivative term around t, 
Ax(t + )) = Ax(t) + A)x' (t) (2) 
where b is a small phase shift of x(t) and A is the amplitude factor. When b is due to 
T where T is the sampling period. Provided that x(t) is 
sampling jitter then, -- _< b <_ �, 
sampled according to the Nyquist criterion, b is sufficiently small for the first derivative 
term to adequately account for the sampling jitter. Hence, bl accounts for the residual error 
remaining after optimisation of the integer a. a is approximately determined by the beat 
detector of the ICD which attempts to detect the fiducial point of heart beats using filters 
and comparators. bo and bl can be determined by minimising the squared error between 
the current signal window and the previously recorded template which in this case has a 
closed form solution in terms of correlation coefficients. However, in Section 3 we present 
an alternative iterative procedure suited to low-power analogue implementations.

The ICEG is first high pass filtered to remove the DC and then is bandpass filtered to 
prevent aliasing and enhance the high frequency component for beat detection. (This is 
the filtering approach already existing in an ICD and therefore not implemented by us). 
This then feeds the discrete time analogue delay line, which is continuously sampling the 
signal at 250 Hz. The analogue samples are then transformed by a two layer network. The 
first layer implements the linear prediction by adjusting the amplitude b0 and the phase 
of the analogue vector. Note that the phase consists of two components, the coarse part 
o corresponding to sample lags and the fine part b corresponding to intra-sample lags. The 
second layer calculates the distance between the linearly predicted vector and the template 
w(n) to be matched. A comparator is provided so that a match to within a given threshold 
may be detected. 
3.1 Chip Architecture 
Input to the IC is via a single analogue channel which is sampled by a bucket brigade 
device of length 30. The resultant 30 dimensional analogue vector is adaptively linear 
transformed to facilitate a shift and scale invariant match to a digital (7 bit per dimension) 
template. The IC generates digital representations of the square of the Euclidean distance 
between the transformed analogue vector and the digital template. A block diagram of the 
IC appears in Figure 1. The IC has been fabricated. Performance figures in this paper are 
based on measurements of the chip fabricated in a 1.21m CMOS MOSIS process. 
The block diagram shows the input signal being sampled by the bucket brigade device 
(BBD)[4]. The signal is sampled at a rate of 250 Hz. Existing circuitry in the defibrillator 
detects the peak of the heart beat and hence indicates a coarse alignment (due to detection 
jitter) to the template stored in the template DACs (TDACs). The BBD continues to sample 
until the coarse alignment is attained at which point the IC is biased up. The BBD now 
contains a segment of the ICEG corresponding to one heart beat. The digital error output is 
then monitored with the linear transform blocks configured to 1:1 mappings until an error 
minimum is detected indicating optimal sampling alignment. The three linear transform 
coefficient DACs (CDACs) which are common to the 30 linear transfor[n, blocks may then 
be adapted to further reduce the matching error. The transformation can be represented by 
/(n) = aox(n - 1) + ax(n) + ax(n + 1) where a0 corresponds to CDAC0 etc. This 
constitutes a general linear long term prediction [8]. Constraining CDAC0 and CDAC2 to 
be equal magnitudes and opposite signs results in a minimisation of errors due to phase 
and amplitude variation and a simpler adaptation procedure. The matching error is com- 
puted via the squarer blocks and the summing node. The matching error consists of both a 
magnitude and exponent thereby increasing the dynamic range of the error representation.

The magnitude is the output of the squarer block. The exponent is determined by control 
of a current reference in the squaring circuit. A reference DAC and precision current com- 
parator provide the means of successive approximation A/D conversion of the matching 
error current Inn. Using this scheme heart beat morphology can be classified by loading 
different templates (TDAC values). A stream of beats may be compressed by identify- 
ing matches with continuously updated representations of previous beats. Close matches 
are encoded by an index and an amplitude coefficent while poor matches are encoded by 
quantised residuals w
