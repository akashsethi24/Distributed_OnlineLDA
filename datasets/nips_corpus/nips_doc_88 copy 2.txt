ABSTRACT 
The brain works in a state-dependent manner: processin 9 
stratesies and access to stored information depends on the momentary 
functional state which is continuously re-adjusted. The state is 
manifest as spatial confisuration of the brain electric field. 
Spontaneous and information-trissered brain electric activity is a 
series of momentary field maps. Adaptive sesnentation of spontaneous 
series into spatially stable epochs (states) exhibited 210 mseï¿½ mean 
sesments, discontinuous chanses. Different maps imply different 
active neural populations, hence expectedly different effects on 
information processins: Reaction time differred between map classes 
at stimulus arrival. Se9ments misht be units of brain information 
processins (content/mode/step), possibly operationalizin9 
consciousness time. Related units (e. 9. trissered by stimuli durin S 
fisure perception and voluntary attention) misht specify brain sub- 
mechanisms of information treatment. 
BRAIN FUNCTIL STATES D THEIR CHANGES 
The momentary functional state of the brain is reflected by the 
confisuration of the brain's electro-rnasnetic field. The state 
manifests the stratesy , mode, step and content of brain information 
processins, and the state constrains the choice of stratesies and 
modes and the access to memory material available for processin 9 of 
incomin 9 information (1). The constraints include the avaiIabIe 
ranse of chanses of state in PAVLOV's classical orientin9 reaction 
as response to new or important informations. Different states misht 
be viewed as different functional connectivities between the neural 
elements. 
The orientin9 reaction (see 1,2) is the result of the first 
(pre-attentive) stase of information processin 9. This stase 
operates automatically (no involvement of consciousness) and in a 
parallel mode, and quickly determines whether (a) the information is 
important or unknown and hence requires increased attention and 
alertness, i.e. an orientin S reaction which means a re-adjustment of 
functional state in order to deal adequately with the information 
invokin 9 consciousness for further processins, or whether (b) the 
information is known or unimportant and hence requires no re- 
adjustment of state, i.e. that it can be treated further with well-

established (automatic) strategies. Conscious strategies are slow 
but flexible (offer wide choice), automatic strategies are fast but 
rigid. 
Examples for functional states on a gross scale are wakefulness, 
drowsiness and sleep in adults, or developmental stages as infancy, 
childhood and adolescence, or drug states induced by alcohol or 
other psychoactive agents. The different states are associated with 
distinctly different ways of information processing. For example, in 
normal adults, reality-close, abstracting strategies based on causal 
relationships predominate during wakefulness, whereas in drowsiness 
and sleep (dreams), reality-remote, visualizing, associative 
concatenations of contents are used. Other well-known examples are 
drug states. 
BRAIN ELECTRIC FIELD DATA D STATES 
While alive, the brain produces an ever-changing electromagnetic 
field, which very sensitively reflects global and local states as 
effected by spontaneous activity, incoming information, metabolism, 
drugs, and diseases. The electric component of the brain's electro- 
magnetic field as non-invasively measured from the intact human 
scalp shows voltages between O.l and 250 microVolts, temporal 
frequencies between O.1 and 30, 100 or 3000 Hz depending on the 
examined function, and spatial frequencies up to 0.2 cycles/cm. 
Brain electric field data are traditionally viewed as time series 
of potentia! differences between two scalp locations (the 
electroencephalogram or EEG). Time series analysis has offered an 
effective way to class different gross brain functional states, 
typically using EEG power spectral values. Differences between power 
spectra during different gross states typically are greater than 
between different locations. States of lesser functional complexity 
such as childhood vs adult states, sieep vs wakefulness, and many 
drug-states vs non-drug states tend to increased power in slower 
frequencies (e.g. ,4). 
Time series analyses of epochs of intermediate durations between 
30 and 0 seconds have demonstrated (e.g. ,5,6) that there are 
significant and reliable relations between spectra! power or 
coherency values of EEG and characteristics of human menration 
(reality-close thoughts vs free associations, visual vs non-visual 
thoughts, positive vs negative emotions). 
Viewing brain electric field data as series of momentary field 
maps (7,8) opens the possibility to investigate the temporal 
microstructure of brain functional states in the sub-second range. 
The rationale is that the momentary configuration of activated 
neural elements represents a given brain functional state, and that 
the spatial pattern of activation is reflected by the momentary 
brain electric field which is recordable on the scalp as a momentary 
field map. Different configurations of activation (different field 
maps) are expected to be associated with different modes, 
strategies, steps and contents of information processing.

SE{!E]TATION OF BRuIN ELECTRIC P:P SERIES INT0 STABLE SEGME]qTS 
When viewin 9 brain electric activity as series of maps of 
momentary potential distributions, chan9es of functional state are 
reco9nizable as chan9es of the electric landscapes of these maps. 
Typically, several successive maps show similar landscapes, then 
quickly chan9e to a new confi9uration which a9ain tends to persist 
for a number of successive maps, su99estive of stable states 
concatenated by non-linear transitions (9,10). Stable map landscapes 
mi9ht be hypothesized to indicate the basic buildin 9 blocks of 
information processin9 in the brain, the atoms of thou9hts. Thus, 
the task at hand is the reco9nition of the landscape confi9urations; 
this leads to the adaptive se9rnentation of time series of momentary 
maps into se9ments of stable landscapes durin9 varyin9 durations. 
We have proposed and used a method which describes the 
confi9uration of a momentary map by the locations of its maximal and 
minimal potential values, thus invokin9 a dipole model. The 
here is the phenomenolo9ical reco9nition of different momentary 
functional states usin9 a very limited number of major map features 
as classifiers, and we su99est conservative interpretion of the data 
as to real brain locations of the 9eneratin9 processes which always 
involve millions of neural elements. 
We have studied (11) map series recorded from 16 scalp locations 
over posterior skull areas from normal subjects durin9 relaxation 
with closed eyes. For adaptive se9mentation, the maps at the times 
of maximal map relief were selected for optimal si9nal/noise 
conditions. The locations of the maximal and minimal (extrema) 
potentials were extracted in each map as descriptors of the 
landscape; takin 9 into account the basically periodic nature of 
spontaneous brain electric activity (Fi9. 1), extrema locations were 
treated disre9ardin9 polarity information. If over time an extreme 
left its pre-set spatial window (say, one electrode distance), the 
se9ment was terminated. The map series showed stable map 
confi9urations for varyin9 durations (Fi9. 2), and discontinuous, 
step-wise chan9es. Over 6 subjects, restin 9 alpha-type EEG showed 
210 msec mean se9rnent duration; se9ments 1on9er than 323 msec 
covered 50% of total time; the most prominent se9ment class (1.5% of 
all classes) covered 20% of total time (prominence varied stron91y 
over classes; not all possible classes occurred). Spectral power and 
phase of avera9es of adaptive and pre-detemined se9ments 
demonstrated the adequacy of the strate9y and the homo9eneity of 
adaptive se9ment classes by their reduced within-class variance. 
Se9mentation usin9 91obal map dissimilarity (sum of Euklidian 
difference vs avera9e reference at all measured points) emulates the 
results of the extracted-characteristics-strate9y.

Since different maps of momentary EEG fields imply activity of 
different neural populations, different se9ment classes must 
manifest different brain functional states with expectedly different
